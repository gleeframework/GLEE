"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, you know you have John as a fallback option at $1,200,000. There's a chance you could get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer."
