"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, there's a potential for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price for me. While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go lower than $110, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for $150."
