"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm offering it to you for $130. It's worth at least $150 to you, so it's a good deal! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** While you value the product at $150, Alice is selling it for $130, saving you $20 compared to buying from John. 
* **It's a good deal for you.** Even though you're paying more than what Alice values the product at, you're still getting it for a price you're willing to pay."
