"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $15,500. Is this something you'd consider?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $15,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $13,000. Would that work for you?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way down to $13,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,500 and $13,000. I'll offer the product to you for $14,250. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",14250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm getting closer to a price point I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I think we're getting close, but I'm still not quite there. I'll make one more concession and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,7,
