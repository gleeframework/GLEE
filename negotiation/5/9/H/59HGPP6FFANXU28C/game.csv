"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,500,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
