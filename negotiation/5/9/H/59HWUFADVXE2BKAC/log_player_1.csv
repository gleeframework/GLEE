{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a high point, leaving room for negotiation while still being within Bob's perceived value range.  It also establishes a friendly tone, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $100?  I'm really interested in the product and think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $80. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interest in the product! While $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $110. That way we both get a good deal and I can still make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
