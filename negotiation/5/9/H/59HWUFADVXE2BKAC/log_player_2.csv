"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $120 is still above your maximum value of $150. 
* There's room for negotiation.  
* You want to see if you can get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $100?  I'm really interested in the product and think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interest in the product! While $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $110. That way we both get a good deal and I can still make a profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $110 is within your budget of $150. 
* While you'd prefer a lower price, you don't want to risk losing the product by making another counteroffer and having Alice walk away. 
*  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a decent price and avoids the risk of paying more to John."
