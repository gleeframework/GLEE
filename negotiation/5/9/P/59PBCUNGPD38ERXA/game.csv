"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, though. How about $150?  That's the maximum I can go.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I've already taken a hit with the initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $165? It's a fair price, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to pay $155 and I think that's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",155.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $160, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",160.0,Alice,5,
