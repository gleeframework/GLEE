Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my target price.  I know it's unlikely Bob will accept this right away, but it sets the tone and gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be appealing enough to Bob to reach an agreement."
