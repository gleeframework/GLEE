Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $10,500. I think that's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down in price, she's still trying to get more than your maximum budget. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
