"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly more than his $10,000 limit, and he can get the same product from John for less.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $12,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product for me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is better than $18,000, it's still higher than his maximum of $10,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate further. However, $16,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm confident I can get a good deal from John, but I'd rather buy from you if we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair offer that's still below my maximum, and it gives you a good profit margin.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $14,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's latest offer of $14,500 is still above Bob's $10,000 limit. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as there's a good chance the price won't go lower.  John is offering the same product for a price that's within Bob's budget."
