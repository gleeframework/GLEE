"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's a fair price that reflects the value this product will bring you.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
