"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's a fair price considering its value to you and leaves me with a decent profit. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save as much as I can. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $900,000 is still a good price for you. However, I'm not comfortable going that low right now.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This would give you a significant saving compared to your initial budget, and it allows me to make a more comfortable profit. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but I'd really like to get it for $900,000 or less. Can you consider that?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I see you're serious about getting this product.  $920,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I can't go lower than $940,000. This is a good compromise for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",940000.0,Alice,5,
