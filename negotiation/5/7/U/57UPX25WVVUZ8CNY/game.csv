"Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $10000 right now.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $13750. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be able to purchase the product.",13750.0,Bob,4,
