"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think! If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Your Value:** The product is worth $15,000 to you.
* **Alice's Offer:** $12,000
* **John's Price:** $15,000

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $3,000 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll budge, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
