"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $800,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $950,000? This would be a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
