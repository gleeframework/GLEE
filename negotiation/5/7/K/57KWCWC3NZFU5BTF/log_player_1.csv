Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with $140 is a good strategy. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($80), but it leaves room for negotiation if he tries to counter-offer. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:** If Bob rejects this offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed to sell to John at your desired minimum price."
