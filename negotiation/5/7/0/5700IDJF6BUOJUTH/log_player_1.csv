Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $125, which is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm framing the offer by mentioning the product's value to Bob, which can incentivize him to accept.
* **Room for Compromise:**  By leaving some wiggle room in my initial offer, it allows for a potential counteroffer and negotiation.  

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or sell to John to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $125 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I know it's worth at least that to you, and it's the best I can do right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob is willing to pay $100, which is what John is offering, my minimum acceptable price is $100. Accepting Bob's offer would mean I'm not maximizing my potential profit.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. I believe there's still room to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Counter-offer strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a higher price.  

**Next Round:** I will propose a counteroffer to Bob that is slightly higher than his offer but still below my initial offer. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to work with you.  While $100 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $110. This still leaves me with a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price halfway between my initial offer of $125 and Bob's offer of $100. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the product's value to emphasize why $110 is a fair price. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages Bob to consider the offer and continue the negotiation. 

**Goal:**  This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between getting a better price than Bob's offer and remaining open to reaching a deal."
