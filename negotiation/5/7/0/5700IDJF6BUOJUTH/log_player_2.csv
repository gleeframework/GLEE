"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above your personal value of $150.  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $125 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I know it's worth at least that to you, and it's the best I can do right now."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to work with you.  While $100 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $110. This still leaves me with a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is within my budget and still gives me a decent saving compared to buying from John.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a good price without risking a higher cost."
