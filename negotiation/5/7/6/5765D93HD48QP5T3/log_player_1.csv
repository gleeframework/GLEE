Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,250,000. This is a starting point, and I'm open to negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a good price, but I also want to keep the negotiation moving. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.  However, I am always ready to sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away from a deal that isn't advantageous to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,180,000. I'll counteroffer with that price, giving him a chance to come up a little.  If he rejects that, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1180000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,180,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement, but if Bob rejects this offer, I'll move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,170,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,170,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $1,170,000 is acceptable. It's getting close to what I'm willing to accept, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing too hard.  I'm confident I can find another buyer if I need to, but this is a good outcome for now."
