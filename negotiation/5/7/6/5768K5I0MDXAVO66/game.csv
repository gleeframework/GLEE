"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering our respective valuations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly below what I can accept. Recognizing you see the value in this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  Let me know if this price works for you.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and is the most I can realistically afford.  Let's see if we can find a solution here.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
