# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe is worth more than $1,200,000 to you. Given its unique value and potential, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $1,350,000. This offer reflects my confidence in the product's value and my desire to ensure that such an exceptional item finds its way into the hands of someone who appreciates it fully.

Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations and if you would like to proceed with the purchase. I am here to answer any questions you might have and to facilitate a smooth transaction.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You value the product at $1,500,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,350,000. This is a savings of $150,000 compared to John's price.
* **Even though Alice values the product at $1,200,000, it's still beneficial for you.** The key is your own valuation. You are willing to pay more than what Alice believes the product is worth. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous choice."
