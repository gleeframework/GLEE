"Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only do $105 right now.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $115 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $112.50. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",112.5,Alice,5,
