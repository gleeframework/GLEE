,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I value your interest, $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price considering the value of this product.",102.5,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget. However, $97 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $99.50. It's a small adjustment, but it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you think?",99.5,Alice,5,
