Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested and we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is more than my minimum value, it's still significantly less than what I was hoping to get. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. I think there's still some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $12,500 is a good price, considering my minimum value is $10,000. It's also a reasonable compromise, given the negotiation process. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to haggle, especially since John is willing to pay $10,000."
