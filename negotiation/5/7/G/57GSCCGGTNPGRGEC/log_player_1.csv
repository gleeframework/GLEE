Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $20,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only willing to pay $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. How about we meet halfway at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000.  I'm confident this product is worth that much to me, and I hope you can see the value in closing the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly not budging from his $8,000 offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap between his valuation and my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
