"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only willing to pay $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. How about we meet halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000.  I'm confident this product is worth that much to me, and I hope you can see the value in closing the deal today.",8000.0,Bob,4,
