"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly valuable. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a reasonable compromise, taking into account the value you'll get from owning this product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to my initial counteroffer.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise, taking into account the value you'll get from owning this product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
