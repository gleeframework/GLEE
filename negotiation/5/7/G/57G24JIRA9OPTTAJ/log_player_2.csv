"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly valuable. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.

Alice is not budging much on price, and it's unlikely she'll come down to a price point that works for me. It's better to cut my losses and secure the product from John for $800,000."
