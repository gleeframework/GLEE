Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth much more than my asking price. I'm offering it at $900,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering it at $900,000 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant profit margin above your minimum.  
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" & Value Emphasis:** The message framing aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal and emphasizes the product's value to him.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
