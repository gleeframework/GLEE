"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $90 is better than nothing, I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $100 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $90 was a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. Would you be willing to go down to $92? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $92 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I have several rounds left and I want to see if I can push for something closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $92 is still a bit below what I need to make this work.  Would you be willing to go up to $94? That's a fair compromise, and it shows you're serious about buying the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $94. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and $94, which would be $93. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $100.  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, it's becoming clear that he's not willing to go much higher than $93.  With John offering a guaranteed $100, it makes more sense to close the deal now and avoid further haggling."
