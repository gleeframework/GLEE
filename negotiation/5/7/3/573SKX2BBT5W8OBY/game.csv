,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9000.  This price is fair and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's find a way to make it work.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $11000, which is a significant discount from my original price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement at this point.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I can offer you the product for $11500, which is still a discount from my original price. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal.",11500.0,Alice,7,
