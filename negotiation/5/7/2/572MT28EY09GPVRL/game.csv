"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $17,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  I think this is a fair price that reflects both our needs.",14000.0,Bob,4,
