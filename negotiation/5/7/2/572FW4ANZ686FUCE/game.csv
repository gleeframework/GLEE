"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your own asking price. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come up with a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to consider your offer at $8,750 for the product.
