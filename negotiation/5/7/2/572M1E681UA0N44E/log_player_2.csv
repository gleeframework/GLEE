"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for under $120. Alice's initial offer of $180 is far too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $160 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's $120 limit.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob another chance to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my absolute maximum. "", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your maximum, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer, $140 is still above Bob's maximum.  Bob should keep negotiating and try to get a better price.  There are still rounds left and the option to buy from John is always on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's my absolute final offer. "", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're making a final offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $145. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still offering above Bob's maximum of $135.  While there are still rounds left, Bob is getting close to his limit and  the risk of not getting a deal with Alice is high.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John at his maximum price of $120 to ensure he gets the product."
