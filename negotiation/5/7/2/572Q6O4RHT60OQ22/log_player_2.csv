"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that has the potential to be incredibly valuable. While I can't disclose all the details, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm confident that this product can generate significant returns for the right buyer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.  Consider this a chance to acquire something truly special. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While she claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, this is irrelevant. You only care about the value *to you*. Since you can get the product from John for $1,000,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the best course of action."
