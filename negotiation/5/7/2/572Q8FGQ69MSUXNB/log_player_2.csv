"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can get the product for $100 from John, and Alice is offering it for $95.  While this is a better price than John's, it's still above your personal value of $100.  Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves you $5."
