"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

 Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"",

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My offer is closer to my bottom line ($1,200,000 from John) than Alice's asking price. This might incentivize her to move closer to my range.
* **Respectful Tone:** I want to maintain a positive and respectful tone to encourage continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,250,000? This price still allows me to make a profit and is a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above John's offer. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further, even if it's a smaller amount.  We're getting close to the point where it might be necessary to accept her offer or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?"",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between her last offer ($1,250,000) and my last offer ($1,050,000). This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal fairness and a desire to reach a deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  While I haven't explicitly stated it, I'm implying a sense of urgency by making a counteroffer that's significantly closer to her price. This might incentivize her to accept to avoid further back-and-forth.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm still mindful that I have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000. I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less, but I'm also prepared to walk away from the negotiation with Alice if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still looking to get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer.  Would you consider $1,200,000?  This is a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals.

Alice has met my bottom line. There's no point in further negotiation as I can buy from John at this price. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at the best possible price."
