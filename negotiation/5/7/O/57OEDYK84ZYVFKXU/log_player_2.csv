"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000, which I think is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your perspective, $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my own costs. What do you think?
