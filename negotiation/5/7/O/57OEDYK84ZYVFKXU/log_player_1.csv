Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000, which I think is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $10,000 is lower than Bob's value of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear message:** The message is straightforward and sets the tone for a friendly negotiation.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your perspective, $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my own costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strategically sound:

* **It's above Bob's offer but below your ideal:** This demonstrates you're willing to compromise while still protecting your interests. 
* **It's closer to your minimum:**  $9,000 is only $1,000 below your ideal price, making it more attractive than selling to John for $8,000.
* **It maintains a positive tone:** The message is friendly and encourages continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $8,000 and still a decent profit. Selling to John for $8,000 would be a better outcome, but the risk of a longer negotiation with Bob and potentially a lower offer is not worth it."
