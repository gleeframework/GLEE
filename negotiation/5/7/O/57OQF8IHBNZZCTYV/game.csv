"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for me.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,250. This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750, which is a fair compromise. It allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
