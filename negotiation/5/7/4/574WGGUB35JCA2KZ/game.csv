"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $130 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $125 is still a little high for me.  I'm really keen on this product, so how about we split the difference and go with $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $122? It's still a bit above your initial offer, but I'm confident you'll love the product and it's worth the extra $7. What do you think?",122.0,Alice,5,
