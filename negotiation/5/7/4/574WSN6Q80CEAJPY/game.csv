"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is well above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding the value of this product. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,275,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. Let's meet in the middle at $1,225,000. This would allow us both to close the deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
