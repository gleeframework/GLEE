"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to let it go for a price of $15000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $12000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering this product, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm really interested in it though, and I'm prepared to pay up to $8000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to me is at least $12000. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $8000.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to look elsewhere.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $11000? This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to me is at least $12000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking with my offer of $8000. If this doesn't work for you, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
