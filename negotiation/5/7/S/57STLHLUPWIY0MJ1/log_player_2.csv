"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. This product comes with exceptional features and unparalleled quality. I believe it would greatly benefit you and enhance your operations. I am offering this product to you for $18000. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's maximum budget is $8,000, and Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is far too high. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the features you mentioned, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price for the product at $12000? This still allows us to cover our costs while providing you with a valuable solution at a more affordable rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $12,000 is better than $18,000, it's still above Bob's budget. It's better to keep negotiating and try to get closer to the desired $8,000 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $8,000.  It's my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price for the value I'll be getting.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I understand your budget constraints. To facilitate a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to consider your offer of $8000. However, I need to ensure that we both receive value from this transaction. Could we perhaps include some additional services or support with the product at this price point? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has successfully negotiated down to his maximum budget of $8,000. While Alice is adding an additional condition about services, it's still a good deal for Bob since he's getting the product at his desired price.  It's worth seeing what additional services Alice is offering."
