"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to compromise, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I was initially looking for.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"It seems like we're getting closer, Alice. I could do $77 for it.  Does that work for you?",77.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $80, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",80.0,Alice,7,
