"I'm very interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. I believe this price reflects its value to my business.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price point.  I'm proposing $1600000. This reflects a fair compromise while still ensuring I get a reasonable return on this unique product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1450000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value to my business and is a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1450000 is still not quite there for me.  To be honest, this product is worth a lot more to me than $1500000.  However, I am committed to making this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1550000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's unique value while remaining reasonable for both of us. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that the product is worth a lot to you, but I'm still trying to reach a price that works for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1450000 and $1550000, so I'm proposing $1480000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to my business.",1480000.0,Bob,6,
