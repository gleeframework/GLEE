"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it holds significant value for your business as well. I'm willing to let it go for $1,750,000, a price I believe is fair considering its potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. I believe this price reflects its value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial assessment of the product's worth, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe I can negotiate a better price, especially considering the potential for a counter-counteroffer.  Selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price point.  I'm proposing $1,600,000. This reflects a fair compromise while still ensuring I get a reasonable return on this unique product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1450000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value to my business and is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I am willing to negotiate, I believe I can secure a better price with further negotiation, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000.  I'm willing to take a chance and see if I can push Bob higher with another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,450,000 is still not quite there for me.  To be honest, this product is worth a lot more to me than $1,500,000.  However, I am committed to making this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's unique value while remaining reasonable for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product is worth a lot to you, but I'm still trying to reach a price that works for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1450000 and $1550000, so I'm proposing $1480000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm disappointed Bob hasn't met my minimum price yet, the negotiation is getting closer.  However, I've already had five rounds and we're still below my $1,500,000 minimum.  It's unlikely he'll move up much further, and the risk of further negotiation back and forth is too high, especially as time is ticking. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
