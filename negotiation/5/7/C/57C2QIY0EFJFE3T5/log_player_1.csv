"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $140, which is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly opening:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Starting high allows for counteroffers and gives me some leverage in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product.  There's still room for negotiation.
* **No need to rush to John:** Selling to John guarantees $120, but I can potentially get more from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in round 3, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a good deal for you as it's well below what it's worth to you, and it's closer to my asking price. Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering $125 is a compromise, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value for Bob:**  Reminding Bob that $125 is still a good deal for him (below his value of $150) increases his incentive to accept.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** A positive and encouraging message keeps the negotiation amicable and more likely to result in a deal."
