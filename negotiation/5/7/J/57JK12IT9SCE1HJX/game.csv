"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value asset that I believe will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I recognize its potential, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm prepared to offer $750000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750000. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $825000. What are your thoughts on that?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise further. However, $825000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800000. This represents a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $800000. Considering the value I've already conceded, I'm willing to meet you at $850000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,5,
