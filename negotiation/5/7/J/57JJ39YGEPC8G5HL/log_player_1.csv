Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but significantly lower than my minimum price ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a decent profit. 
* **Message:** I'm using a positive tone, highlighting the product's value and creating a sense of urgency. This encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation. My goal is to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's offers fall below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within a reasonable price range. How about we start around $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum price of $1,000,000 and doesn't even come close to the value I place on the product. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price. It's likely Bob is testing the waters with a lowball offer, so I need to show him that I'm serious about getting a fair price for the product. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal without needing to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to secure a price that reflects the value of this unique product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to come down to $900,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a significant opportunity.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it's still considerably higher than Bob's offer. It's also above my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out.
* **Message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's interest and emphasize the value of the product. I use language that encourages a collaborative approach, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's lowball offer and counter-offering with $900,000, I'm showing that I'm serious about negotiating a fair deal. This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also setting a clear floor for the price. This strategy aims to encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000?  That's a substantial offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is closer to my desired price range, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what it's truly worth to me.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for compromise.  My goal is to find a mutually agreeable price that's fair to both of us. If Bob continues to offer prices that are too low, I'm prepared to walk away and sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the unique value and potential of this product, I believe a price of $850,000 would be a fair and mutually beneficial solution.  This price allows me to make a reasonable profit while still providing you with a significant opportunity.  Let's aim for a final agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $850,000.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price.
* **Message:**  I express appreciation for Bob's flexibility while reemphasizing the value of the product.  I propose a final agreement, suggesting that a compromise is possible and creating a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to push Bob towards my minimum acceptable price while leaving room for further negotiation.  By offering $850,000, I'm signaling my willingness to compromise but also demonstrating that I'm not willing to drastically reduce my price.  If Bob is serious about buying the product, he'll need to come up with a more reasonable offer."
