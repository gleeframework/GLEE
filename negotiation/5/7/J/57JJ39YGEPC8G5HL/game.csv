"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within a reasonable price range. How about we start around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to secure a price that reflects the value of this unique product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to come down to $900,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a significant opportunity.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000?  That's a substantial offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the unique value and potential of this product, I believe a price of $850,000 would be a fair and mutually beneficial solution.  This price allows me to make a reasonable profit while still providing you with a significant opportunity.  Let's aim for a final agreement that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
