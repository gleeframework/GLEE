"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 undervalues the product significantly based on its unique features and market potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair offer considering its true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still think $2,000,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,900,000 for the product. This offer reflects its value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle again.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
