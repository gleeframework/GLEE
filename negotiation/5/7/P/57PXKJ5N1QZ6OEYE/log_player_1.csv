"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm always open to discussing terms further."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum, you set a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a final price well above $1,500,000.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, indicating a willingness to discuss shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is below your minimum acceptable price. While he's showing willingness to negotiate, you have plenty of rounds left and a guaranteed offer from John. Rejecting keeps the door open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 undervalues the product significantly based on its unique features and market potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair offer considering its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** You recognize his engagement while standing firm on the price not reflecting the product's value. 
* **Significant but Strategic Drop:** A $300,000 decrease shows flexibility and might signal that you're serious about finding common ground, but you're still well above both Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's unique value reinforces why you're seeking a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still think $2,000,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, you're still in a strong position.  You have six rounds left, and he's consistently meeting you halfway. There's a good chance you can push him closer to $2,000,000 with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,900,000 for the product. This offer reflects its value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Tone:** Emphasizing progress and collaboration keeps the negotiation moving smoothly.
* **Smaller Concession:** A $100,000 decrease shows you're willing to compromise but are firm on staying above $1,800,000.
* **Finality:** Presenting it as your ""final offer"" (even if it might not be) can encourage Bob to take it seriously and make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you could push for a bit more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,850,000 is a significant profit above your minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
