"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm sure we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.  Would you be interested in discussing a price of $950,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer of $950,000 is quite high. While it's below your absolute maximum, you know you have a backup option with John at $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you create room for negotiation. She might be willing to come down closer to her $800,000 valuation to make a sale."
