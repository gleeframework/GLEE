"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm sure we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.  Would you be interested in discussing a price of $950,000? ",950000.0,Alice,1,
