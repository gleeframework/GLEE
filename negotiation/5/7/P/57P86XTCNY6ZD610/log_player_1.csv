Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point:**  It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** It highlights the potential value to Bob and invites him to respond.

**Why this strategy?**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  Starting higher gives you more negotiating room. 
* **Encourage Bob to counteroffer:**  This keeps the negotiation going and allows for a potential middle ground.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** If negotiations fail, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me ($15,000).  I need to see if I can push for a higher price. 

**Why reject and counteroffer?**

* **Potential for a better deal:** There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Gaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale and might incentivize him to move closer to my price.

**Next steps:**

In the next round, I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. To make this work, I'd need to go with $10,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer rationale:** I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to my desired price while still being attractive to Bob. $10,500 is a significant increase from his previous offer, but it's less than my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on value and fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price, emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Open-ended question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  It's a compromise that keeps me closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain negotiation momentum:**  By counter-offering, I'm keeping the negotiation active and pushing for a better deal.
* **Keep the option to sell to John:** If Bob rejects again, I still have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can we consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation progress:** Bob has come up significantly from his initial offer of $9,000.  
* **Closing the deal:** While $10,000 is still below my desired price, it's a reasonable compromise, especially considering the possibility of selling to John for $15,000.

**Why accept?**

* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing time and potentially losing Bob as a buyer.
* **Risk vs. reward:** The potential of getting a higher price is outweighed by the certainty of selling to Bob at a price that's still significantly higher than his initial offer.
* **Maximizing profit:**  $10,000 is a good profit and a good starting point for future business with Bob if he proves to be a reliable customer."
