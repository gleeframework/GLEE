"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than my minimum asking price and still allows you a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $900,000. You're aiming for $800,000 and have a backup option to buy from John at that price. Reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $875,000 for the product. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet halfway and see if we can finalize this deal.

While $875,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your budget. You can try to negotiate further. If Alice won't budge, you can always buy from John for $800,000."
