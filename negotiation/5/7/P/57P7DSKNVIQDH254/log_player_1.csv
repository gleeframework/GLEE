Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, considering it's worth a lot more to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer. This allows for some back and forth and hopefully maximizes my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is a decent offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing him as a buyer altogether.  Accepting his offer secures a sale and earns me a decent profit."
