"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I think we can find a more mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects a more accurate valuation and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
