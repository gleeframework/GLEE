"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price significantly higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""unique value,"" we subtly set the stage for a high-priced item without directly revealing its worth to us.
* **Open to Discussion:**  While starting high, it's crucial to express willingness to negotiate. This prevents alienating Bob and encourages him to participate actively in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product,  $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. We have plenty of room for negotiation and a guaranteed offer from John.  We should reject Bob's offer and present a counteroffer that moves the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1900000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledgement:**  We acknowledge Bob's offer, demonstrating active listening and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  We reiterate that his offer is too low based on the product's value, but without directly dismissing his assessment.
* **Significant Drop:** We've made a substantial price reduction  ($400,000) to signal flexibility and incentivize Bob to engage further.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Our new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me while also being within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Bob's offer has increased substantially, indicating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Below Minimum:**  However, $1,000,000 is still below our $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Negotiation Room:** We have six rounds remaining and can likely negotiate a better price by continuing the discussion. 
* **Backup Option:** We maintain the security of selling to John for our minimum price if needed."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the value you'll gain while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Tone:** We maintain a collaborative tone, emphasizing finding a solution that works for both parties.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We've lowered our price by $300,000, a significant move that shows flexibility.
* **Above Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps us comfortably above our $1,500,000 minimum while still aiming for a strong final price.
* **Value Focus:** We continue to tie the price to the value Bob will receive, reinforcing the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trend:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating progress towards a potential deal.
* **Still Below Minimum:** $1,200,000 remains below our $1,500,000 minimum, leaving a significant gap.
* **Time for Leverage:** With four rounds remaining, we still have time to negotiate a higher price and maximize our profit. We are not in a position where we need to accept an offer below our minimum yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  To bridge the remaining gap, I propose a final offer of $1,450,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  By framing this as our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and signal that we're nearing the limit of our flexibility.
* **Slight Concession:** We've lowered the price by $50,000, a smaller concession that indicates we're serious about closing the deal at a strong price.
* **Just Above Minimum:**  This offer protects our minimum acceptable price while still leaving a small amount of room for Bob to negotiate if he's highly motivated.
* **Justification:**  We continue to emphasize the value proposition, reminding Bob of the benefits he'll receive."
