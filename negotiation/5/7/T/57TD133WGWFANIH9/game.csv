"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value in this product, I'm unfortunately not able to meet your initial price point. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it,  which I believe is a fair price considering the market value. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit.  If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're at your limit, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $825,000. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $820,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,
