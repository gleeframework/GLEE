Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,150,000 is still significantly higher than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening:** A high initial offer shows confidence in your product's value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, let alone my desired price. 
* **I still have room to negotiate:**  I can counteroffer at a price higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer. 
* **I'm not desperate:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a decent backup, but I can potentially do better with Bob.

**Next steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to his value, but still within my acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Still above my minimum:** It's significantly higher than my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Testing the waters:** It's a good way to see if Bob is willing to budge further.  

Let's see if Bob is ready to close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **Time to increase the pressure:** Rejecting his offer will force Bob to consider a higher price. 

**Next steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer. I will also emphasize the value of the product and the opportunity he's missing out on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This offer is a final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob.  It's a significant increase from his last offer, but still lower than my initial offer. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale, but it's not my ideal price. Rejecting his offer risks losing the sale to him or needing to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Emphasize the value:**  In my communication with Bob, I'll reiterate the value of the product and highlight the opportunity he's missing out on if he doesn't accept this final offer.

This counteroffer leaves little room for further negotiation, so let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No significant progress:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and it seems we're stuck in a stalemate.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks lowering the final price even further.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is better than the current situation. 

**Conclusion:**

While I hoped for a higher price, the current negotiation with Bob is not leading to a satisfactory outcome.  Selling to John ensures a secure and profitable sale, and it's time to move on."
