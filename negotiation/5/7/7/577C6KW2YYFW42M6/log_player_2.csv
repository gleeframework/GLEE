"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's product is valuable, her starting offer of $950,000 is above your maximum budget. You know John is offering the product for $800,000.  By rejecting this offer, you can see if Alice is willing to come down to a price closer to your range."
