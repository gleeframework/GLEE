"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to my budget.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. However, I've already compromised by meeting you at $825,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $820,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",820000.0,Alice,5,
