"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to sell to him at a higher price, I'm not ready to accept such a low offer. I will proceed to the next round and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is still a good amount above my minimum, but a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to accept a deal that undervalues my product.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm getting closer to what Bob seems willing to pay. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  However, we are getting close. I'm not ready to accept his offer yet, but I will continue negotiating with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000}
```

I'm going to make one last counteroffer to Bob before considering selling to John. I'm lowering my price to $1,225,000.  This is only $25,000 above my minimum, and I think it's a fair price considering how close we are to a deal."
