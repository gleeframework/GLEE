"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider $110 for the product? It's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget better.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we say $130 for the product?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit high for me. Let's compromise at $125. It's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $130, which would be $127.50. Would you be willing to meet me there?",127.5,Alice,5,
