"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

The offer is too high. We can start negotiating lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:**  Going straight to our ideal price ($8,000) establishes a firm anchor for the negotiation. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning our budget, we provide Alice with a reason to consider the lower price.
* **Polite and collaborative:** The tone remains positive, expressing interest in finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Alice came down, $10,000 is still significantly higher than our target price and John's offer. 
* **Maintain momentum:** Rejecting shows Alice we're serious about a lower price.
* **Alternative available:**  We have the safety net of John's $8,000 offer if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $9,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and brings us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic compromise:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, but still below her current offer and above our ideal. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while aiming for savings.
* **Clear justification:**  Highlighting the substantial increase from our previous offer makes this counteroffer more appealing to Alice.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** We continue to express a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
