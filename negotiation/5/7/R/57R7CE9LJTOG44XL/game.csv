"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the sale today. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
