Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to go lower.  
* **Strong Starting Point:** Starting at your desired price gives you room to negotiate if needed, but Bob might accept immediately.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but emphasizes the value of the product and the fairness of the price."
