"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,999 is significantly higher than your $8,000 maximum and your alternative option of buying from John for $8,000. 
* By rejecting this offer, you can move to your backup plan and save a considerable amount of money."
