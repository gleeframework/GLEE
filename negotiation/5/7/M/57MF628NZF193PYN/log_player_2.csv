"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a much lower price than Alice's offer. It's worth rejecting the initial offer to see if a lower price can be negotiated."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to balance that with the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, while giving you a discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation to get closer to Bob's target price, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $950,000. This price is fair given the product's value and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, which is still a discount from my initial offer, but reflects the value I believe the product holds. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is within Bob's budget and a significant discount from John's price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and he'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially prudent decision at this point."
