# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something worth significantly more to you. I know you're a discerning buyer, and I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll get. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
