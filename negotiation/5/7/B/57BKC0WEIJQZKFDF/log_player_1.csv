Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth while also providing you a significant return on your investment.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a strong offer that still nets me a considerable profit above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Respectful Negotiation:**  The message frames the offer as mutually beneficial, emphasizing value and potential for Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
