Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm starting with a price of $130, slightly above the value of the product to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate, and I'm confident he'll be willing to pay a bit more than his minimum value to get the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm offering $125 in this round. This is still above Bob's minimum value but closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, and we can reach an agreement."
