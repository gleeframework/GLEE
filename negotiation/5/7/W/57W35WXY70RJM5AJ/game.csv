"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. That's still a good deal for you, and it fits within my price range.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $8,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,250. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a minimum price, but $9,250 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",8875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,875 is still a bit below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $9,100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",9100.0,Alice,5,
