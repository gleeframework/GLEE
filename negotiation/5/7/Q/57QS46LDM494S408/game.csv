"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm motivated to find a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
