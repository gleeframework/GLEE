"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is a compromise that still reflects its value to you, while also being more in line with your budget.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
