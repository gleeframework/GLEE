"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is significantly below what I need to sell the product.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $8,800. That's the lowest I can go.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $8,800 is still quite a bit below what I need.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $9,200.  I'm confident this price is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think.",9200.0,Alice,5,
