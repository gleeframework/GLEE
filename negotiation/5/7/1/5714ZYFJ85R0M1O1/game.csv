"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $9500 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to go down to $8000?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about $8500?  I'm really serious about getting this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $8700. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,5,
