"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to her. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting, you can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $105 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm sure you'll agree it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still within my budget and a good price for the product.  There's a chance I could negotiate further, but the risk of her rejecting my offer again is high, and I could end up buying from John for $120.  It's better to secure the product now at a reasonable price."
