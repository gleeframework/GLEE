It's always worth trying to negotiate and get a better price. Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000, there's room to negotiate.  Let's see if we can get Alice closer to your desired price."

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. It's worth trying to push for a slightly lower offer.  Let's see if we can get a price closer to $10,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $11250, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and you're only $250 away from your counteroffer. It's likely that she won't go any lower, and you're getting a good deal at this price.  It's time to take advantage of this opportunity."
