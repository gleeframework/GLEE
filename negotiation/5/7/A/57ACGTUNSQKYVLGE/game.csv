"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would give us both a good deal.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",11100.0,Bob,4,
