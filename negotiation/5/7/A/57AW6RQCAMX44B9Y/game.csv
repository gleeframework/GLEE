,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's the highest I can go.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $85 is definitely closer to what I had in mind. However, I'm still a bit far off from my ideal price. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $87.50? That's the highest I can go.",87.5,Bob,4,
