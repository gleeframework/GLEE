"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a little high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but this is my final offer. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
