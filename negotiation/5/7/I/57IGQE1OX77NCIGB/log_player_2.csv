"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is still to save money. While $1,300,000 is better than John's offer, there's still a gap between Alice's offer and Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a little high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but this is my final offer. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $1,250,000 is less than the $1,500,000 John is offering.
* **Limited Rounds:** There are only a few rounds remaining. If Bob rejects this offer, he risks running out of time and being forced to buy from John.
* **Compromise:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  While Bob's ideal price was lower, accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
