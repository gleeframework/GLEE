,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a great price for the product and it leaves room for us both to be happy with the outcome. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but $8,750 is still a little below where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900, but that's my final offer. It's a great deal for a high-quality product, and it gives us both a win.  What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
