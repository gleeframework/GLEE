"Alice, that's a bit high for me. I understand the value of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. This is still a significant discount for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
