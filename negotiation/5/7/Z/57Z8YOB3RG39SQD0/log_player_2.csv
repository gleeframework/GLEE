"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Considering its quality and features, I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We're aiming for under $80, and Alice's first offer is significantly higher. Let's see if we can negotiate her down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the pitch, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if it's a good deal. Would you consider $65?"", ""product_price"": 65} 

**Reasoning:** We start with a strong counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows we're serious about a lower price while leaving room for negotiation.  There's a chance Alice might accept a lower offer outright, and even if she counters, we're closer to our target range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about I offer the product to you for $75? This still allows me to make a profit while providing you with a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

We're getting closer, but $75 is still above our ideal price. Let's see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $75 is closer, but I'm really looking to spend closer to $68. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 68}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** We're moving closer to Alice's price in smaller increments to show willingness to negotiate but also firmness on our budget.
* **Target Focus:**  We're reiterating our target price range to keep Alice aware of our limit. This gentle pressure might encourage her to accept if she's willing to go that low. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** We're still below John's $80 offer, so we have some room to negotiate knowing we have a backup plan."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your feedback, Bob, I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly. How about we agree on $72 for the product? This still ensures a reasonable profit for me while being a fair deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $72 is a good price, only $4 above our ideal target and significantly less than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate might push Alice away, or she might not budge much lower. It's not worth the risk of losing this deal for a potential savings of only a few dollars. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're over halfway through the rounds, and securing the product now eliminates the time pressure of potentially needing to go with John's offer."
