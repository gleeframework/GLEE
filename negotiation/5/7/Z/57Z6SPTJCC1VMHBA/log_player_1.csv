"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and be a wise investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious but not outrageous offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's seriousness.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""immense value and potential"" aims to anchor the product's worth in Bob's mind at a high level.
* **Leaving John as a Backup:** While John guarantees $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a significantly better deal. 

This strategy allows us to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay while still having the safety net of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below our starting point and our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). We have room to negotiate, and we're aiming higher. By rejecting this offer, we signal to Bob that we believe the product is worth more while keeping the door open for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer. While I recognize the value you see in this product, $1,800,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $2,100,000? This reflects the product's true worth and potential for a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):** We're lowering our price from $2,300,000 to $2,100,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate but still maintaining a strong position.
* **Reframing Value:**  We're reiterating the product's value and emphasizing the potential ""return on investment,"" appealing to Bob's business sense. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps us significantly above our ""walk-away"" price of $1,500,000 (from John), giving us more room for negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $2,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,900,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,900,000 is a significant amount and well above our safety net of $1,500,000 from John.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob indicating this is his final offer suggests he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns, especially with a solid offer on the table. We're already past the halfway point in our negotiation rounds. 

Accepting $1,900,000 secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away completely, leaving us with John's lower offer."
