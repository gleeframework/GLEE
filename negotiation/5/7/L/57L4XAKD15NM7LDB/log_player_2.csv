"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, as it's worth much more to me.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $14,000. He should try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,500 is better than her previous offer, it's still above his target of $12,000. He should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,750? This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13,125. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice's offer of $13,125 is still higher than Bob's target price.  While he could continue negotiating, it's unlikely Alice will come down further, and there's a risk of losing the deal if they run out of rounds. It's better to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with from John."
