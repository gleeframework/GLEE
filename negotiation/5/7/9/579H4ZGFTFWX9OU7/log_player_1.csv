"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** A friendly opening message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive.
* **Open ended question:**  This encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $105 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth (at least $100 for me).
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left.  I can counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 117.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:**  $117.50 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Highlighting fairness:**  The message emphasizes that this price is fair for both parties, making it more likely to be accepted. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Continuing a friendly and open dialogue helps keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $110 is only $10 less than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Time is running out:** I only have 6 rounds left.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk of Bob getting impatient or finding another seller.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even though I'm accepting this offer, I could still try to negotiate a higher price in the future if a better opportunity arises."
