,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $9000? ",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as 9000. How about we meet in the middle at 10500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a little higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as 9500, Bob. But I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at 10250? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10250 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
