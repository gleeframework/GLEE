Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,500? This is a good price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,800 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a bit more commitment from you. How about $9,200? This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9200}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

The negotiations with Bob are getting closer, but we're running out of rounds.  I'm not confident I can get a price higher than $9,000 from Bob. It's better to sell to John and get my minimum price."
