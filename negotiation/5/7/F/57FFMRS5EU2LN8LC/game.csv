"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is way above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $600,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide a significant return on investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of reach. I'm prepared to go up to $750,000, which is a significant jump from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price given the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can strike a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close. I value your willingness to find a compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $825,000?  This reflects the value of the product while recognizing your investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting really close! I'm confident we can finalize this deal. Let's try $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to move forward.  What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,6,
