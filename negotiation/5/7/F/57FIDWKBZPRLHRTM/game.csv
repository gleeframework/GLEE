"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit too low on budget. How about we try $13,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $14,000. This is a fair price, and we can close this deal quickly.  What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $14,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $13,800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",13800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $14,200.  This is a fair price, and we can close this deal now. Let me know what you think.",14200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go much higher, but I'll try to meet you in the middle again. How about $13,900? This is as high as I'm willing to go.",13900.0,Bob,8,
