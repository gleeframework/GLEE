"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $14,500 is quite close to your maximum budget of $15,000. However, you know the product is worth significantly less to Alice ($12,000). There's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $13,000?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer:

* **Shows interest:**  Acknowledging Alice's offer and expressing interest keeps the negotiation positive.
* **Provides a reason:** Citing budget limitations is a common and understandable tactic.
* **Offers a significant reduction:**  Aiming for $13,000 creates a substantial gap for further negotiation while still leaving room to go up if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, as that's still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice reducing her offer to $14,000 shows she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still a decent margin between her offer and both your target price and her product valuation. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if you can get a better deal before considering accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Seeking a compromise:** Suggesting a price directly in the middle of your previous offer and Alice's counteroffer  frames it as a fair and balanced solution.
* **Maintaining politeness:** Using phrases like ""How about we meet in the middle"" and ""reasonable compromise"" continues a collaborative and non-confrontational tone.
* **Keeping an eye on John:**  While you're aiming to get the best price from Alice,  remember that John's offer is a fallback option. If Alice rejects this counteroffer and doesn't move significantly in the next round, it might be time to consider John."
