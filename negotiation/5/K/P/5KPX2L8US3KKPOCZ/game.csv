"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and I can buy it today.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $140, which is a fair compromise.",140.0,Alice,5,
