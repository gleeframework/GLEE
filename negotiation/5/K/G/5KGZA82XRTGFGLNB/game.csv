"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 as a starting point for our negotiation. I believe this price is fair, considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered and leaves us both with a satisfactory outcome.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $975,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. I believe this reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's try to close this deal with a price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
