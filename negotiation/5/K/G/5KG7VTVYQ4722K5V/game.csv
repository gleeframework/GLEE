"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's in both our best interests.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1300000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings to your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1300000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1100000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1200000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
