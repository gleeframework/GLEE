Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Close to Your Minimum:**  While we want to maximize profit, pricing it too close to $150 (your guaranteed sale price with John) might scare Bob away.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning a ""limited time"" can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while also ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
