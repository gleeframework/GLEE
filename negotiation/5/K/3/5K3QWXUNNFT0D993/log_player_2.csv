"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but $130 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $70? That's a pretty big jump from my last offer."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, which I appreciate.  While $70 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $100 to see if we can close this deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has stated this is her final offer. 
* Her final offer ($100) is still more expensive than John's offer ($80).
* There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will get the price down to an acceptable level.

It's better to secure the product from John at a price within your budget than to risk getting stuck with no deal and potentially having to settle for a higher price later."
