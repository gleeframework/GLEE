"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the value I know the product has for Bob, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and creates a sense of a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us and avoids the need to go through multiple rounds of counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. Would you be willing to consider a price of $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although $128 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for improvement. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $128 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $131.50?  This price reflects the value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 131.50}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This might convince Bob to accept the offer and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $131.50 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $129? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's getting close to my minimum price, and I'm unsure if I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of selling to John for a lower price."
