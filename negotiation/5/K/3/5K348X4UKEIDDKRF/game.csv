"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $8,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  To make this work, I could come down to $18,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",15000.0,Bob,4,
