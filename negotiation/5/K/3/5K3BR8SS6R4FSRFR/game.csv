"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $110.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $125 for the product. It's a fair price that's within both our budgets.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go down to $125. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $128 is my lowest price. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you at this price.",128.0,Alice,5,
