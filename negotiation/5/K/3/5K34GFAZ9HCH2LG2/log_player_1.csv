"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a good profit.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm using friendly language to signal that I'm open to negotiation. 
* **Strategic reserve:**  I have a backup option (John) to ensure I don't settle for a price that's too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $10500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a better offer than his initial value, it's still below my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation continues:** I'm choosing to reject the offer to continue negotiating.  There's still room to reach a more favorable price.
* **Strategic advantage:**  I have the advantage of a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which provides leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500,  which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and firmness:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but I'm still holding firm to my minimum profit margin. 
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a way to find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Continue the negotiation:** I'm keeping the communication open, signaling that I'm still interested in closing the deal, but not at a price that undervalues my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'd like to keep the negotiations within my budget. I would be willing to pay $11000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below target:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum target of $15,000. 
* **Leveraging the backup option:** I have John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay my full price, which gives me confidence to continue negotiating. 
* **Seeking better terms:** I believe I can still secure a higher price from Bob, so I'll continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm stance:** I'm setting a clear final offer, signaling that I'm serious about closing the deal but not willing to go lower.
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm again emphasizing fairness by highlighting the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Ultimatum with leverage:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by mentioning the other buyer (John), implying I might accept his offer.  This creates a stronger incentive for Bob to accept.
* **Seeking a compromise:** I'm still leaving room for a compromise but with a lower price point to push Bob towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am willing to pay $11000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  Accepting Bob's offer would result in a lower price, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result.
* **Guarantee a profitable sale:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum requirement and aligns with my initial goal. 

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of failing to close the deal and losing the opportunity to sell to John is too great at this stage."
