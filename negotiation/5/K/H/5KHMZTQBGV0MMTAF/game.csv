,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the price of $2,200,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While your offer is generous, the true value of this product, in terms of its potential return on investment, is significantly higher. I could consider letting it go for $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
