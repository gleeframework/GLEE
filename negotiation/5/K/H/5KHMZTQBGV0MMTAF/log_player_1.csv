"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for success, I believe a price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,200,000, we set a high anchor point. Even if Bob doesn't agree to this price, it might influence his perception of a ""fair"" price, pulling his counter-offer closer to our target.
* **Leaving Room:** While we have John as a backup, maximizing profit with Bob is ideal. This initial offer gives us space to potentially reach a deal above $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the price of $2,200,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, we're only in Round 2.  We have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal from Bob. Accepting $1,500,000 now would be leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While your offer is generous, the true value of this product, in terms of its potential return on investment, is significantly higher. I could consider letting it go for $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial concession from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000, signaling flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** We're not just lowering the price; we're emphasizing the product's value and potential ROI, subtly shifting the focus from the initial high price.
* **Targeting Above Reserve:** We're still aiming for a price significantly above our reserve ($1,500,000), leaving room for further negotiation while staying in a profitable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant amount above our reserve price ($1,500,000) and represents a substantial profit.
* **""Final Offer"":** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, signaling he's unlikely to go higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we might be able to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk that Bob walks away. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
