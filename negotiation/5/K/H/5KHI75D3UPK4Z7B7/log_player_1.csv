Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly higher allows you to potentially earn a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your minimum acceptable price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This makes it seem like a good deal while still leaving you with a profit.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
