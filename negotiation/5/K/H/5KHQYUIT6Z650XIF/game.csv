"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's worth considering a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing the product for $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, considering your value for the product and my budget.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that balances my value for the product with your budget.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that takes both of our positions into account.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you at $1,080,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
