"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $900000. I'm interested in this product, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $750000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800000.  It's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $825000, but only if you're willing to throw in an additional feature that I think would greatly enhance the product's value. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer and the added feature. However, I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm  not interested in the additional feature at this time, as I'm unsure of its long-term value.  I'm willing to go up to $800000 without the added feature.  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
