# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price.  Let's see what Alice's counter offer is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $900,000. I'm interested in this product, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is showing some flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit high.  Let's try to negotiate a bit lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  It's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $825000, but only if you're willing to throw in an additional feature that I think would greatly enhance the product's value. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is trying to add pressure and complexity to the deal.  While adding a feature might be appealing, it's a risky move that could increase the cost later if it has unexpected problems or if the added value isn't worth the extra price.  Let's see if we can get her to come down on the price without the added feature."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer and the added feature. However, I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm  not interested in the additional feature at this time, as I'm unsure of its long-term value.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000 without the added feature.  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
