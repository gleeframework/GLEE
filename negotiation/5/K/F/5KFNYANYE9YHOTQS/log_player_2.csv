"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept Alice's offer. There's a chance you can get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if she doesn't budge. It also gives us room for a compromise in future rounds."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not the best price for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target of $10,000.  There's still room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her previous offer, which is a bit frustrating. However, I'm still determined to get a better price. I'm hoping to get Alice to come down further with another counteroffer. I'm not yet ready to give up on getting a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being stubborn and not coming down to my desired price.  I am still determined to get a better deal. I will make another counteroffer.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm starting to consider the option of buying from John if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is back to the original price, which is my absolute maximum. There's no benefit to continuing to negotiate with her.  I'm running out of time, and I'm confident I can get the same product from John for the same price.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more agreeable seller."
