Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and the product's value to him. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting his offer allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to keep costs low. However, $850,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant compromise. This price still gives you a substantial return on your investment.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $875,000 for the product. I believe this price strikes a balance between the product's value and my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

While Bob's offer is still below the ideal price, it's closer to your minimum acceptable price and significantly higher than selling to John.  It's a good compromise that secures a profitable sale."
