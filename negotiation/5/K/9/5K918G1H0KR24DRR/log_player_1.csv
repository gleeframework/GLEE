Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000. 

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's below his perceived value) while maximizing your profit. Since you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum, you can be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth in the right hands."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 leaves a potential profit of $150,000 for you and saves Bob $50,000 compared to his perceived value. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price.

**Remember:** This is a starting point. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to negotiate further."
