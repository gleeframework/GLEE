"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth it.",13000.0,Alice,5,
