"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and sell the product for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really keen on getting this product.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can sell the product to you for $12,800. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,800 and $12,600. I can sell the product to you for $12,700. It's the best I can do. What do you think?",12700.0,Alice,7,
