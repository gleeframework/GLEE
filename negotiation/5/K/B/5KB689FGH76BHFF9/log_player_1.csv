Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a strong starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. I'm confident that the product is worth at least this much to me, and I'm hoping Bob will see its value as well. If he rejects, I'll see what counteroffer he makes and adjust my strategy accordingly. Remember, I can always fall back to selling to John for $800,000 if I don't get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is still a good deal.  It's significantly higher than what I could get from John, and it's a reasonable compromise considering his initial rejection.  I'm going to accept his offer and move forward with the sale."
