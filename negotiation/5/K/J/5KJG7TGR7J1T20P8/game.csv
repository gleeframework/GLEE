"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your initial proposal. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiations. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the initial price, and I'm willing to consider a revised offer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
