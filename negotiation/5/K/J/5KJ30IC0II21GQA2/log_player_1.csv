"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000, hoping to get a good price for my product. It's important to remember that I have a safety net with John, so I'm not overly worried about losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell immediately.  Bob's low offer shows he might be willing to pay more, so I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob sees that I'm serious about selling, but I'm not giving away the product for a pittance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I could try to squeeze out another couple of thousand dollars, I'm not sure if it's worth the risk. The negotiation is taking time, and I want to avoid losing out on a good deal. Accepting $16,000 feels like a solid middle ground."
