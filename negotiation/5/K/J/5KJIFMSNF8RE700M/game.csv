"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and would be a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $13,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if this is something you'd consider.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me. How about we settle this right now at $11,500?  It's clear we're both interested in making a deal, and this price seems fair given our previous offers.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $11,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $12,750. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",12750.0,Alice,7,
