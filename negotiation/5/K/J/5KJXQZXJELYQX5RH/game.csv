"Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity to sell you a valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to keep it within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer, but $10,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I could go up to $7,000.  What do you say?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far apart from $7,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. How about $9,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $7,500? That's a significant increase from my last offer.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $7,500. How about $8,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",8500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I appreciate the compromise.  However, $8,500 is just a bit beyond my absolute limit. I can do $7,750 and no more.  That's the best I can offer.",7750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. $7,750 is a good offer, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable selling for that low. I'll make one more compromise. How about $8,000? I think that's the lowest I can go, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,9,
