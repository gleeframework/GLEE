"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. It's always worth trying to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to secure the product at a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  $850,000 is a significant reduction from $950,000 while still leaving some room for Alice to make a profit. This offer is a strong starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob is serious about buying but is also looking for a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly lower than her initial offer. While it's still within Bob's budget, it's not a significant enough improvement to justify accepting it.  Bob is still in a strong position to negotiate a better price.  There's still room to get a better deal, so continuing to negotiate is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's moved closer to Alice's offer but is still holding out for a better price.  This offer is a compromise, showing a willingness to meet halfway, but still emphasizes Bob's desire to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is just slightly lower than her previous offer, and still too high for Bob.  He's not willing to settle for such a small reduction.  The negotiation is still within a reasonable range, and Bob has a few more rounds to get a better price. There's still potential to get a better deal, so Bob should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price. This offer is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise. It's also still lower than Alice's latest offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to get the best possible deal. With fewer rounds remaining, Bob is trying to find a price that both parties can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to her initial offer, and it's becoming clear that she's unwilling to budge much further. With only a few rounds left, the chances of getting a significantly lower price are diminishing. 

Bob has two choices:

1. **Continue negotiating:**  There's a chance Alice might lower her price again, but it's a risky gamble, especially with fewer rounds left. 
2. **Buy from John:** This guarantees Bob the product at a known price.  While it's not the best price, it's within his budget, and avoids the risk of further negotiation failure.

Given the limited rounds and the likelihood of Alice being unwilling to negotiate further, the safest and most practical option is to buy from John."
