"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $850,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still leaves you with a substantial profit margin and is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about $925,000?  That's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $962,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this deal will be beneficial for both of us. Let me know your final decision.",962500.0,Alice,5,
