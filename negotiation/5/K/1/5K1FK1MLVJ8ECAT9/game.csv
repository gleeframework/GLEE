"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity. I think you'll really appreciate it.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950000 is a bit steep, but I have to say that I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $825000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering the value you're offering and the fact that I'm a serious buyer.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $825000 is still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you the product for $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking $785000 is a fair price for the product, considering its value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",785000.0,Bob,6,
