This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's also lower than your minimum desired price, leaving room for negotiation. This should encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing you to potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $100 for this product. Would you be willing to come down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum price of $120. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $110 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for a little less. Would you consider $108? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a good profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:

While $108 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal profit margin. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a bit higher."
