Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to your operations. My initial offer is $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of this product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price before settling for the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects the significant value of this product and leaves room for both of us to benefit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. This aligns closely with my budget while still acknowledging the value of the product. I hope this offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 matches my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially try for a higher price, there's no guarantee I'll get it, and there's a risk of losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer secures the sale and guarantees my minimum desired profit."
