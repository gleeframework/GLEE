Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. This approach aims to maximize my profit while also keeping the possibility of a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I will reject it and counteroffer with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly to $175, which is still well above my minimum of $150. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, hopefully leading to a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I would prefer to sell to Bob,  his offer is only slightly above my minimum.  I will reject his offer and counteroffer again, aiming to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm further lowering my price to $160, which is closer to Bob's last offer. This shows that I am serious about reaching a deal, but I'm still holding onto a price that reflects the product's value. I hope that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
