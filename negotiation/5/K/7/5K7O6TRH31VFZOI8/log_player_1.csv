Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $12,000. It's worth a lot more to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is well above your minimum of $8,000, so you're starting off strong.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The offer is also significantly less than the $15,000 value Bob places on the product, giving him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's friendly and open:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to discuss the price further. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. This product is valuable to me, but I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is too low:** While it's better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than the $12,000 we initially offered. We want to try and get closer to our target price.
* **Negotiation is key:** There's still time to negotiate, and it's better to keep trying to reach a better price than settling too quickly.

**Next Steps:**

We will counter Bob's offer in Round 3. We can aim for a price somewhere between $10,000 and our original $12,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's still a great value for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
