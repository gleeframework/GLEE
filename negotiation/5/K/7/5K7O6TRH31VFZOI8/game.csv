"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. This product is valuable to me, but I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's still a great value for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,
