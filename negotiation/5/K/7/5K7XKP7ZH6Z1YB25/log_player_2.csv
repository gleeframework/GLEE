"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for a price of $1500000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's wise to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, signaling Bob's seriousness about negotiating and his understanding of the value gap.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $800,000 still provides room for Alice to counter with a higher price while remaining within Bob's budget. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and professional tone, emphasizing Bob's interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to accept $1200000 for it. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth rejecting and seeing if Alice is willing to go lower. There's still potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's last offer but still shows Bob's willingness to compromise. 
* **Staying within budget:**  $950,000 is still within Bob's budget, but leaves very little room for Alice to counter.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a positive and encouraging tone, aiming to close the deal."
