"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for something that's very valuable to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $950000 for the product?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not able to meet at $1050000. I would like to propose $1000000 as the final price for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
