Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring I make a profit if he accepts outright. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** It's important to remember I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John. This knowledge empowers me to be firm in my pricing with Bob."
