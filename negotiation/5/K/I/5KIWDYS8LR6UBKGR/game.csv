"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly valuable product that holds significant potential. I believe it's worth at least $1200000 to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. My initial offer is $1500000. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand $1500000 was a bit high, $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1000000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $900000. Can you consider this counteroffer?,900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $900000 is still a bit below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to compromise a little further, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the value of this product. Let's split the difference and go with $950000. This is a fair price considering the potential this product offers.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920000, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. Can you consider this counteroffer?",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $920000 just doesn't cover the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to make one last concession.  Let's meet at $935000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value and potential of this product, while also respecting your financial constraints.  Let me know what you think.",935000.0,Alice,7,
