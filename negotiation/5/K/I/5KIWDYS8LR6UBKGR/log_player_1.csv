Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand $1,500,000 was a bit high, $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.

Round 4

This is a fair price considering the potential this product offers."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $920,000 just doesn't cover the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to make one last concession.  Let's meet at $935,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's counteroffers are getting closer to my minimum price but not yet at a point I feel comfortable with. The negotiation is taking time, and I'm nearing the end of my rounds.  Given that I can get $1,200,000 from John right now, I'll go ahead and sell to John. This ensures I get a price I'm happy with and doesn't risk losing the deal entirely."
