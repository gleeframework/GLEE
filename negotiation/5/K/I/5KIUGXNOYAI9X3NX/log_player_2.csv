{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, you still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1350000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, while also being fair to me. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and see if we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, and you're now only $50,000 apart.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's not guaranteed.  At this point, accepting her offer secures the product at a price significantly better than what John is offering, minimizing your risk of losing out on the deal."
