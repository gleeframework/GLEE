Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum.  This will give me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  However, it's not too high that it would scare him off immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm counteroffering at $140. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but it's still higher than my minimum price and allows for some wiggle room in case Bob makes another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $135 is still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John for $100.  Further negotiation might not lead to a significantly better price and could risk losing the sale entirely."
