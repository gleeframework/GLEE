"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  To be honest, my budget is closer to $1,000,000. If you can meet me at $975,000, we have a deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $975,000.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
