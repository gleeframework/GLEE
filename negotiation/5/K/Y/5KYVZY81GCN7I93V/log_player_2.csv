"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to her own valuation than yours.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price. While buying from John is a guaranteed good price, you might be able to save even more with a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  It also allows you to gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but only slightly. We're getting close to your maximum price with John.  It's worth seeing if you can push Alice a bit further down before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  To be honest, my budget is closer to $1,000,000. If you can meet me at $975,000, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer:

*  **Signals your position:** By mentioning your budget is close to $1,000,000, you're subtly implying that's your walk-away point.
* **Offers a compromise:**  It's a significant jump from your last offer, showing you're willing to move if Alice is.
* **Creates urgency:**  Framing it as ""meet me here and we have a deal"" encourages a quick decision. 

This puts the pressure on Alice and might be enough to close the deal without having to go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $975,000.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Her latest offer is still $50,000 above your guaranteed price with John. Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a low chance of success and might even make her less likely to compromise. It's time to secure the product at a good price from John."
