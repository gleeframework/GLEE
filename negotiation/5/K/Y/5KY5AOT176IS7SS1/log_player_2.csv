**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good deal, it's still above your target of $1,000,000.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However,  $950,000 is significantly below what I need to consider selling.
