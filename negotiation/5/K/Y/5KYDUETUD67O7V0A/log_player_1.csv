{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Option to Walk Away:** I'm keeping John as a backup buyer, which allows me to be more assertive in negotiations.

**Strategy:**

* I'll gauge Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If he rejects, I'll either make a counteroffer or consider selling to John. 
* If he accepts, I've made a good profit!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I cannot afford to sell for such a low price.
* **John is a Safe Backup:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit.
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob that's closer to my minimum price but still allows room for negotiation.
* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and the potential for reaching a deal. 
* If Bob doesn't budge, I'll likely sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Closer to Minimum:**  My counteroffer of $11,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Compromise and Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but I'm not sacrificing too much.
* **Positive and Engaging Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and engaging tone to keep the conversation positive and encourage Bob to consider my offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, as he may be willing to go slightly higher than his initial offer. 
* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Close to John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is only slightly more than Bob's offer, and it guarantees my minimum desired profit.
* **Negotiation Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a stalemate or a lower final price, especially if he is unwilling to budge further.

**Strategy:**

* I'm willing to risk a slight loss in potential profit by selling to John, as it's a more secure option and prevents further negotiation risks. 
* By selling to John, I avoid the possibility of accepting a price that's too low and ultimately leaves me unsatisfied."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However,  $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $11,500 to $11,250.  This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Middle Ground:**  My counteroffer is a ""meet in the middle"" offer, taking the average of Bob's last offer ($10,750) and my previous offer ($11,500).
* **Positive and Motivational Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and motivational tone, emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of my offer.

**Strategy:**
