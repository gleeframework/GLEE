"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $18000. It's a great opportunity to own a unique item that's worth $12000 to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to make it happen. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, but $18000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for this product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still a profit for you and within my budget. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $12500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I can cover my costs. How about we meet at $16000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14000 for this product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value I place on it and your need to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but $14000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum requirement. How about we meet at $17000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you place on it.",17000.0,Alice,5,
