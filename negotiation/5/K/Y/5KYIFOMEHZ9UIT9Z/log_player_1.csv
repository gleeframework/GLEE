Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly lower than Bob's valuation leaves space for negotiation while ensuring a price favorable to Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net, allowing Alice to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale."
