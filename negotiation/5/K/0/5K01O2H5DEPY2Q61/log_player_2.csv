"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm personally very passionate about and I know it has the potential to really benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth, but I'm confident you'll find it to be a very wise investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than your maximum budget and John's price, there's room for negotiation. Her language suggests she's eager to sell and might be willing to go lower.  By rejecting this offer, you could potentially secure a better deal from Alice without having to resort to paying John's higher price."
