"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm personally very passionate about and I know it has the potential to really benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth, but I'm confident you'll find it to be a very wise investment. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,
