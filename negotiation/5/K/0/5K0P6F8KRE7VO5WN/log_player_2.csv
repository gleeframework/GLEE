(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth exploring if we can get a lower price from Alice.  $120 is a good starting point, but we can try to negotiate lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, I'm hoping to stay within a budget of $100. Would you be willing to work with me on that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a slightly lower price.  I'll try one more counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets me closer to my goal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $115. I think the product's value is worth it. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $112, which is closer to my budget and a reasonable compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, I'm starting to run out of time and the risk of having to buy from John for $150 increases.  I'll take this offer."
