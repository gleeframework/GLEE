Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is quite high though.  This product would be valuable to me, but I'd need a significant discount to make it work.  How about we start the conversation at $750,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer, but I'm afraid I can't go any higher than $975,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you, as I need to make a decision soon.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and it's unlikely he'll move significantly from $975,000.  While a deal with Bob might still be possible, it carries the risk of him walking away altogether. Accepting John's offer guarantees the $1,000,000, which is a reasonable outcome in this scenario."
