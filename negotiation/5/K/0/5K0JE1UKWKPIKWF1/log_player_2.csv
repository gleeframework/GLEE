"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is too high. I know I can get the product for $800,000 from John, so I'll start negotiating with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, Bob. However, $650,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is coming down, but $750,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my limit, hoping she's willing to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and $700,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $750,000. How about we aim for $725,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer to my range, $725,000 is still too high. I'm willing to push a little further, but I'll need to be prepared to walk away soon and buy from John if Alice doesn't budge significantly."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $710,000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $720,000?

Alice is not budging enough. It's time to cut my losses.  I can get the product for $800,000 from John, and at this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to bridge the gap enough to be worth the time and effort."
