Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,150,000, so I'll offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,500,000 and a significant improvement from her initial offer. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** There's been substantial progress in the negotiations, and rejecting this offer risks further rounds without guarantee of a better deal. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that a deal with John might become more attractive if Bob continues to reject offers.

This offer is the best Bob can realistically expect at this point, considering the time constraints and the potential for John's offer to become more appealing. Accepting allows Bob to secure the product while saving a significant amount of money."
