"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's significantly below its true worth. While I value it at over $1.5 million, I'm willing to let it go for $1,300,000. This represents a substantial savings for you and a chance to own a product that holds significant value. Consider this a unique opportunity, as I have another buyer ready to pay full price should you decline. ",1300000.0,Alice,1,
