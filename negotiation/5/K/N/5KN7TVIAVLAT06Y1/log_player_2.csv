"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice:**  You get the product for $100, which is within your budget and saves you $20 compared to buying from John.
* **Buying from John:** You pay the full $120, which is your maximum budget. 

It's always better to save money if possible, so accepting Alice's offer is the best choice in this scenario."
