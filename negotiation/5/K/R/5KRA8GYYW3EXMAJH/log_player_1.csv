Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it's still within a range Bob might consider given his perceived value of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm starting to lose patience. The risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price than what John is offering is too high. Selling to John guarantees me my desired minimum price, so it's the best option at this point."
