Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is greater than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $10,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $12,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This gives Bob the opportunity to counteroffer, potentially leading to a price closer to $12,000. 

By starting with a reasonable offer, you increase the likelihood of a successful negotiation while also protecting your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price of $10,000. How about we split the difference and agree on $9,500? "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,250 is still a little below my initial goal of $10,000, it's a good compromise.  It's a significantly better price than selling to John for $8,000, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get me much higher.  It's time to close the deal."
