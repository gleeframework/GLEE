"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product.  I'm really interested, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?  I think that would make a deal more likely.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $875,000.  This would be a great price for both of us, allowing me to acquire this product and you to still make a good profit.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not ready to give up on the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $890,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's worth.
