"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still gives you a significant benefit, and it's a price I can accept.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,350,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
