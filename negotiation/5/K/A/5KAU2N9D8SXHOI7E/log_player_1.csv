{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $110 is higher than $80, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below my minimum value:** I'm still making a profit at $110, but I'm open to negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand my offer and respond. 

I'm willing to negotiate further if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $120 if I feel the negotiation isn't going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is a decent offer and better than nothing, I'm not comfortable with that price. It's still below my minimum value of $120, and I'm confident I can get closer to that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's perceived value of $80, but it's closer to my minimum value of $120. This allows for further negotiation while still ensuring I don't sell below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum of $120. I believe I can get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
``` 

This counteroffer is still a bit above Bob's last offer, but it's closer to my minimum value and shows I'm willing to compromise. It also creates a sense of urgency by suggesting a ""split the difference"" approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm willing to make one more offer. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $120.  While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, the risk of him walking away and me ending up with nothing is too high.  I'm better off selling to John for $120 and guaranteeing a profit."
