This product is worth $100 to you, and Alice's offer is way too high. You're not going to accept that price right away, and you'll see if you can get a better deal from Alice."

Alice's offer:

Alice is willing to come down to $130, which is closer to your target price.  However, you can still try to get a better deal. You'll reject this offer and see if you can get her lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer of $115, but I'm still not getting my desired price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $125. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is still higher than what you are willing to pay. Even though she's already come down from her initial price, you can get the product from John for a lower price. It's time to move on and secure the product from John."
