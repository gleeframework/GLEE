"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice!  $140 is a good starting point, but I'd like to see if we can come closer to $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a significant discount while still remaining within his budget. $130 is a fair counteroffer, demonstrating he's serious about buying but also leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand you're looking to get closer to $130, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer is right in the middle of Bob's last counteroffer and her previous offer. This is a good compromise.
* **Within budget:**  $135 is still within Bob's budget of $150.
* **Better than John:** It's cheaper than buying from John, making it the best option currently.

While Bob could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, accepting the offer ensures a deal and saves time and effort."
