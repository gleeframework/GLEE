"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go that low.  $700,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $750,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for that low. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $800,000? This is the absolute minimum I can accept, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $775,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I only have 4 rounds left, and I'm not sure I'll be able to convince Bob to go higher. I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $800,000 from John, so I'm going to sell to John."
