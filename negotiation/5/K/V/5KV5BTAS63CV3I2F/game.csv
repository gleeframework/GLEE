"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth $1,200,000 to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer!  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'm aiming to get closer to my budget.  Would you consider $1,000,000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still a bit away from meeting my target. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we try $1,050,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
