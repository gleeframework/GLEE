This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, and it acknowledges the potential value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. There's still a decent margin for negotiation, and I can try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $12,500. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, given the value you see in the product, and it would help me achieve a fairer price."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  While $13,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired price, and I'm happy to accept it.  It's a good deal for both of us."
