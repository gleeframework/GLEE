"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $175 is well above your maximum price.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This counteroffer is your maximum price, making it clear that you are serious about purchasing the product while still getting the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is closer to your maximum, it's still above your ideal price. There are still rounds left, so rejecting and counteroffering again is the best option to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still staying within your budget. It's a reasonable compromise, especially considering the number of rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $130 is a good deal. You're still getting a decent price within your budget. Accepting the offer now avoids further negotiation rounds and the risk of Alice making a counteroffer that you might be forced to accept.  While you could try to counteroffer again, the risk of reaching an impasse or needing to buy from John for $100 outweighs the potential savings."
