"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $8000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  $12000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm eager to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle at $13000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and your budget.",13000.0,Alice,5,
