"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it right now.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. But I can't go lower than $105.  This is still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,5,
