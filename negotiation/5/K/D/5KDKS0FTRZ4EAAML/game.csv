"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $125 is still a little too high for me.  How about $110? That's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $110, but I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $120? I think that's a good middle ground for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $115, which is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  What do you say?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $115, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $122? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.",122.0,Alice,7,
