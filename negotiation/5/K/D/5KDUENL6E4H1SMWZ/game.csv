"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $15,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond this price point. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. While I understand your perspective, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $13,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
