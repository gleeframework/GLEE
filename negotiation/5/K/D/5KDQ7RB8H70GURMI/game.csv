"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I could be willing to negotiate down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
