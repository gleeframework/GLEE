Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for a special price just for you.  What do you think about [product_price]? Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Product Price:**  I've set the price at $130. This is a good compromise. It's lower than my minimum value of $150 but still allows me to make a decent profit. It's also higher than Bob's valuation of $80, giving him a potential incentive to purchase.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and aims to generate interest. It highlights the special offer just for Bob, potentially creating a sense of urgency.

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While $130 is not the absolute maximum I could potentially get from Bob, it's a good balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a sale.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  By offering a lower price, I'm increasing the chance that Bob will accept the offer. This reduces the risk of him rejecting the offer and me having to sell to John at my minimum price.

**Note:** This is just one possible strategy. You could choose to offer a different price or use a different message depending on your assessment of Bob's likelihood of accepting an offer."
