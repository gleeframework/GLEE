Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer lined up."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000. Your goal is to get the highest price possible.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning another buyer, you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept the $1,000,000 offer rather than risk losing the product.
* **No Room for Negotiation:** The message is firm about the price and the fact that it's a one-time offer. This minimizes the chance of Bob trying to negotiate a lower price."
