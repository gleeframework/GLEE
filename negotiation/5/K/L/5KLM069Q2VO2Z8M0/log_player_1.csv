Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation or allows you to appear accommodating if Bob pushes back.
* **Staying Below Bob's Value:** The offer is still $20 below Bob's perceived value ($120), making it attractive to him. 
* **Close to Your Minimum:** While aiming high, the offer is close enough to your minimum ($150) that you're still making a good profit even if there's no further negotiation.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
