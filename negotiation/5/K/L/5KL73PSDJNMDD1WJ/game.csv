"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm on a budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $140 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think it's worth it to you.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",130.0,Bob,4,
