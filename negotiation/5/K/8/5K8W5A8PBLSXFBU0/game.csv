"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet that price point. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a more attractive offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're still looking for a bit more wiggle room. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you. If you're still not comfortable with this price, I'll need to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
