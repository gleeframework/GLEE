"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is a reasonable starting point,  the product's true potential warrants a higher price. To demonstrate my willingness to find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's fair considering the value proposition. I'm open to continuing the conversation to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1305000.
