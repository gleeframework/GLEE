"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'd like to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding the value of this product. While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
