Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  My message highlights the benefit to Bob, making the deal seem more attractive.
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  I'm leaving the door open for negotiation, signaling I'm willing to find common ground.
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John gives me confidence to push for a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept $9,000, it's not worth sacrificing $6,000 for a quick sale. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to close the gap between our desired prices. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is below my minimum price, I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this work.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives us a chance to close this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm counter-offering with $11,000, which is still above Bob's offer but significantly lower than my initial offer. 
* **Compromise:**  I emphasize my willingness to compromise to make the deal happen, signaling good faith.
* **Value Proposition:**  I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefit of the deal.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's find a solution"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground. By showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate, I increase the likelihood of Bob accepting a price closer to my desired range. I'll also remain vigilant in case Bob stalls and I need to turn to John for the guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While it's not ideal, there's still a chance I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round.  
* **Time and Risk:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob has a risk of delaying the sale and potentially ending up with a worse outcome. Accepting his offer now secures a decent profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

While I accept Bob's offer, I'll keep the possibility of further negotiation in mind. If Bob is willing to compromise, I'll be prepared to explore that option."
