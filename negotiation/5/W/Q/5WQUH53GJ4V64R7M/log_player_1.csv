Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. This allows for negotiation while still leaving room for profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we settle on $950,000? This reflects the unique value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $950,000, Bob's offer of $925,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a good deal for me, and it seems like Bob is not willing to go higher. I'm not willing to risk losing the sale to John for a slightly better price, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
