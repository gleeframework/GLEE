Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 to reflect your interest. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value this product provides.  What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $1,000,000 is still far from what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,250,000. This represents a fair compromise considering the value you'll receive and my need to recoup my investment.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product and allows me to cover my costs. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal, and I hope we can finalize it quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to $1,150,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. To be honest, I'm getting ready to accept John's offer of $1,500,000.  However, to show you my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $1,300,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** $1,300,000 is above Bob's desired price and he only has one round left to negotiate.
* **John is a guaranteed deal.**  John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, which is within Bob's budget. 
* **Time is running out.**  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept Bob's final counteroffer in the last round. It's safer to go with John to secure the product."
