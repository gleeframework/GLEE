"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By starting at $1,750,000, I allow for a few rounds of negotiation before I reach my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (John's offer).
* **Positive tone:** Using a positive and encouraging tone (""great deal"") might make Bob more inclined to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have 10 rounds, and rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a more favorable price.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 to reflect your interest. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value this product provides.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the ""value"" the product provides to Bob to make the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Negotiation strategy:**  By offering a significant discount, I show a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Time is on my side:**  I still have 7 rounds left to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This offer reflects a fair value considering the product's worth to me and my budget constraints.  I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's an increase from his previous offer, $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time to push for a better deal:**  I still have 6 rounds left, and there's potential to reach a better price. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** If I can't reach a deal with Bob that meets my minimum, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000.  This gives me leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $1,000,000 is still far from what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,250,000. This represents a fair compromise considering the value you'll receive and my need to recoup my investment.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and negotiation:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value proposition:**  I again emphasize the value the product provides to Bob to justify the price.
* **Urgency:**  I use ""Let's work together to make this happen"" to add a sense of urgency and encourage a quick decision.
* **Maintaining a price above John's offer:** My offer is still above John's offer, giving me a safety net if Bob rejects.
* **Time is still on my side:**  I have 5 rounds left to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to recoup your investment, but $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise considering the value I'll receive and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's an increase from his previous offer, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, so there's no need to settle for less than my minimum.
* **More time for negotiation:** I have 4 rounds left, and there's still potential to reach a higher price with Bob. 
* **Strategic rejection:** By rejecting, I can counter with a slightly lower offer, potentially leading to a faster agreement closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product and allows me to cover my costs. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal, and I hope we can finalize it quickly."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** I'm reducing my offer slightly, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Urgency:**  I emphasize ""finalize it quickly"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining a price above John's offer:** $1,200,000 is still above John's offer, so I have a fallback option.
* **Time is running out:** With 3 rounds remaining, I need to start pushing for a deal.
* **Positive tone:**  I keep the tone positive and hopeful to maintain a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise considering the value I'll receive and my budget constraints.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $1,150,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed safety net:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a surefire way to get my minimum price.
* **Two rounds left:**  While I have two rounds left, there's a high chance Bob won't budge further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  It's not worth risking getting a lower price than John's offer, especially with only two rounds remaining.

**Overall:**  At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John and guarantee my minimum desired price.  There's a high chance that Bob won't increase his offer further, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price than I could get from John."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $1,150,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. To be honest, I'm getting ready to accept John's offer of $1,500,000.

This is a great deal for both of us, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency and pressure:** I'm using John's offer as leverage, making it seem like I'm ready to walk away. 
* **Final concession:** I'm offering a lower price than my previous offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Win-win tone:** I emphasize how this deal is good for both of us.
* **Limited time:**  This is my last counteroffer before selling to John, so I need to pressure Bob to accept."
