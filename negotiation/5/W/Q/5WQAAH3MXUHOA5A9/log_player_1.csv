"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for a very competitive price of $1,400,000. It's a significant value for you, as you know it's worth $1,500,000.  Let's start the negotiations with this offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product and what I am able to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired value of $1,000,000. I have 10 rounds and can potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,375,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,360,000 for your product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise and respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is only $10,000 less than my last counteroffer of $1,375,000.  It's above my minimum of $1,000,000 and we're getting closer to a deal. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
