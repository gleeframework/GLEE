"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,375,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
