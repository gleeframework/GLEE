"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's  worth negotiating with Alice to see if a better price can be reached.  There are still 9 rounds available, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I'm interested in the product, your initial price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. By offering $7,500, Bob demonstrates a genuine interest in the product while establishing a clear starting point for negotiation. This gives Alice some room to counter, but also makes it clear that Bob won't go higher than $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $9,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true worth of what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price point, it's still above his budget.  Alice's offer is a good starting point for further negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can continue to explore options to get the price down to his $8,000 limit or below. With multiple rounds remaining, it's still worth pursuing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,500? I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a significant step towards Alice's price point while staying within Bob's budget. By offering $8,500, Bob demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise, but also sets a firm upper limit. This counteroffer is a strong position for Bob, as it leaves room for further negotiation without exceeding his budget."
