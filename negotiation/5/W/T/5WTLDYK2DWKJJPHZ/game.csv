"Alice, while I'm interested in the product, your initial price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $9,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true worth of what you're getting.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,500? I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
