Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140, which is $20 above my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by highlighting the product's value and showing interest in his perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $120. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $125, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $115. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further price reductions is too high. It's better to secure the guaranteed $120 from John."
