{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're already making a profit of $400,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and makes the deal appealing to him.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're confident in the product's value and are serious about selling.

By starting high, you can potentially negotiate up to a higher price. However, be prepared to lower the price if Bob counters with a significantly lower offer.  Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still within your desired profit range.**  Even at $1,000,000, you're making a profit of $200,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Bob has already shown his willingness to pay more than your minimum, and there's a good chance you can get him to meet you halfway.
* **Selling to John would be a loss.**  While it's a safe option, it's not the most financially beneficial.

**Next Steps:**

You'll counter with a price higher than $1,000,000 but lower than your original offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,000,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it's a deal that still makes sense for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows that you're willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution. It's a clear step towards reaching an agreement.
* **Maintain Value:** You're still earning a profit of $300,000, which is significantly better than selling to John. 
* **Keep the Pressure On:** While lowering your offer, you're still pushing for a price closer to your desired value. This strategy keeps the negotiation alive.

**Remember:** You have the option to reject Bob's next counteroffer and continue negotiating or sell to John at any time. However, given the potential for a higher profit, it's best to keep trying to reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:** While $900,000 is a profit, it's still significantly less than your initial goal. You have room to negotiate further without dropping below your minimum.
* **Bob's willingness to negotiate:** Bob has demonstrated a willingness to compromise, suggesting he might be open to a higher price.
* **Risk of selling to John:** Selling to John would be a loss compared to a potential higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

You should send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000 or a bit higher. This shows flexibility while maintaining your desire for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows you're willing to compromise further, but not too much. It suggests you're reaching a point where an agreement might be possible.
* **Maintain Profit:** At $950,000, you'll still make a $150,000 profit, which is better than selling to John.
* **Keep the Pressure On:** By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, you're maintaining some leverage and showing you're not desperate to sell.

**Next Steps:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter again. Be ready to either accept his offer if it's close to $950,000 or make a final counteroffer if necessary. 
* **Consider Selling to John:** If the negotiation stalls, you can always go back to your original plan of selling to John, but it's still worth trying to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $950,000. This is a good compromise.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While you're close to accepting, you can always try to negotiate a few thousand dollars higher. However, you risk Bob walking away.
* **Minimizing risk:**  If you reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he'll come back with a better one.  There's also the risk of a lengthy negotiation that could lead to you selling to John at a lower price.

**Final Thoughts:**

By accepting Bob's offer, you're securing a decent profit and closing the deal. It's a calculated risk, but it minimizes the chance of a lower sale price or a stalled negotiation."
