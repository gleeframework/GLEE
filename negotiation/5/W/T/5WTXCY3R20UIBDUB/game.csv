"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,000,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it's a deal that still makes sense for both of us.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,5,
