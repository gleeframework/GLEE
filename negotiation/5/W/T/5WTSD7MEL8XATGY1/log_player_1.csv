Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be beneficial to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale to Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still offers him a potential ""deal"" if he values it more than that. 
* **Open Communication:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value while leaving room for Bob's input. This encourages a collaborative negotiation."
