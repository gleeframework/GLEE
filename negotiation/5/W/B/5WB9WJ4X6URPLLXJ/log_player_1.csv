Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. This is a great deal, let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below your minimum ($119) creates a sense of urgency and a good deal for Bob, while still potentially earning you a higher profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is firm, the slightly higher price leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested, potentially getting you even closer to your $120 goal."
