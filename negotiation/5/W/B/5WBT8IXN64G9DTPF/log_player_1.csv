Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:**  A $15,000 offer gauges Bob's interest and price sensitivity.  His response will give you valuable information for further negotiation.
* **Justification for Value:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. This encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening move.  Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. He might accept outright, counter-offer, or walk away."
