"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you consider $9,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get closer to $9,500 by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
