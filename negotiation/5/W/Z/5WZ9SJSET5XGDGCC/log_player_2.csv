"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $12,000 to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price, potentially saving even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. For this product, which I believe is worth $12,000 to you, I propose a price of $9,800. I hope this meets within your comfort zone. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,800, which is a very reasonable price.  At this point, Bob should accept the offer. 

* Bob's maximum price is $12,000, and he's getting the product for $9,800.
* It's unlikely he'll get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.
* Buying from John would cost him $12,000, which is significantly more expensive."
