"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price and offer you the product for $9,500.  This price still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $9,500 is a better offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider this price?",9250.0,Bob,4,
