"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's always the potential to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  If you can't get a better deal, you can always fall back to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal and encourages her to come down further. I'm still within my budget, and if Alice rejects this offer, I can still negotiate further or ultimately fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than her initial offer. I'm still willing to negotiate further.  I'll try a counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my desired price point. If she's unwilling to negotiate, I'll consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below Alice's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to meet halfway, but I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that might encourage Alice to accept.  If she rejects, I'll assess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or move to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting progressively higher, and I'm not sure if I can negotiate her down further.  I'm concerned that the negotiation is going in the wrong direction. While I'd prefer to pay less, buying from John for $1,000,000 is still within my budget and guarantees a purchase.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
