"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to the value he places on the product.  If he rejects, we can move closer to my minimum acceptable price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still giving him a good deal compared to his perceived value.  I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
