# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you and the original price I had in mind.

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $900,000 is still more than you're comfortable with.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price once more before considering John's offer."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'll meet you at $890,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This price still reflects the value of the product to you and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
