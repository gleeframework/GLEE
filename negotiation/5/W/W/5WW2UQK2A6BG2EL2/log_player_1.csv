Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price close to your minimum acceptable value ($15,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, making him feel like he's getting a better deal while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum price, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. 
* Gauge Bob's interest and adjust your strategy accordingly. If he seems hesitant, you might consider a slightly lower price in a subsequent offer."
