"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you than that.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to make a more modest investment at this time.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your concerns about the investment, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this asset.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I have an alternative option at $800,000.  If you'd be willing to come down to $750,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand you have an alternative option at $800,000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
