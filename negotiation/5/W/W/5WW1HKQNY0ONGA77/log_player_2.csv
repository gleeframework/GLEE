"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before reaching your $800,000 walk-away point or even John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to make a more modest investment at this time.  Would you consider $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility and leaves room for negotiation.  By being polite and acknowledging the product's value, we maintain a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand your concerns about the investment, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice met us halfway, $900,000 is still above our target price and John's offer. We have room to negotiate further down towards our goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I have an alternative option at $800,000.  If you'd be willing to come down to $750,000, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** By revealing John's offer, we create urgency and signal our serious interest if Alice meets our price.
* **Compromise:** We're moving closer to Alice's counteroffer while still aiming for a significant discount. 
* **Call to action:** ""Ready to close the deal today"" encourages a quick, positive response from Alice."

# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand you have an alternative option at $800,000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is firm at $850,000, which is still above John's offer.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will budge significantly.  At this point, it makes more financial sense to secure the product from John at our target price."
