Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to be flexible and make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $8,200. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is a tough one. Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and $8,200 isn't terrible. However, we're still a ways away from her value, and we have some rounds left to negotiate.  We'll try one more time, but we need to be cautious."

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.
