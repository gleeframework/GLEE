"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth even more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price from Alice first. $14,000 is a bit too close to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit high for me right now. Could you do $11,000?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price.  This leaves room for negotiation while still staying well below my $15,000 maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering how much you value the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is meeting me closer to the middle ground, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try one more time to get closer to $11,000."

{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about $11,750?"",

This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer and my previous one. It shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a lower price."
