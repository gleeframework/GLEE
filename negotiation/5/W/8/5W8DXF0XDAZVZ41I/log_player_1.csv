Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth even more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  There's room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:**  This allows for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Remember, the key is to be flexible and willing to negotiate to get the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit high for me right now. Could you do $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell it at that price. 

I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering how much you value the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,750 is still below my minimum value of $12,000. While I'm open to negotiating, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for $12,000. 

I'm going to sell the product to John to ensure I get at least my minimum desired price."
