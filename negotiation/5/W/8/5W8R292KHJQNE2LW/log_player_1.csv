"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,500 is too low for me.  I'm confident I can get a better price, or at least the $8,000 I need from John if I have to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's a fair price, and I'm getting closer to my goal of $8,000. I'm not sure if I can get a better offer in the next few rounds, and I don't want to risk losing this deal."
