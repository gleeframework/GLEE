"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,000, which would be $13,000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
