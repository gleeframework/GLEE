Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit lower than my minimum value, but I'm willing to negotiate. I believe this price is fair, as it's still above Bob's perceived value. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to consider his counteroffer and negotiate further. However, I won't go below my minimum value of $12,000, as I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

This is my counteroffer to Bob. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still above his offer and closer to my desired price. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm not confident I can get him to go higher. It's not worth continuing to negotiate when I have a guaranteed buyer who's willing to pay my desired price."
