"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price close to my desired value, but leaving room for negotiation. I'm also framing it as a win-win scenario to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a good price, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm offering a price that's still higher than my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while also ensuring I still make a profit. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $115, which is the lowest I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit. I'm going to reject the offer and try to get a higher price from Bob in the next round.  I believe I can still get closer to my target value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $115 is tempting, I need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125. This is the absolute lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm sticking to my goal of getting a higher price, but I'm also showing flexibility by coming down a bit more.  I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to pay $120, which is the absolute maximum I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial target, we're getting close to the end of negotiations.  $120 is still a good profit for me, and I risk losing Bob and potentially ending up with $100 from John if I continue to reject.  It's time to accept the offer and close the deal."
