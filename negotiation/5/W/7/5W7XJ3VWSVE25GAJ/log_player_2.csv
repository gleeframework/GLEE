"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100, and Alice is offering it for $90. 
* You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.
* You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the initial offer gives you more room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Since you value the product at $100, you want to start your counteroffer below that. 
* **Target:**  Ideally, you'd like to get the product for $80, as that's what Alice values it at. 
* **Realistic Offer:**  $85 is a realistic starting point. It's lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for her to make a profit. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Alice to consider your counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $87.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:** Alice has lowered her price from $90 to $87.50, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is closer to your target of $85. 
* **Profit for Alice:** Alice is still making a profit at $87.50, as she values the product at $80.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could try to negotiate further, there's a chance that Alice will become less flexible or reject your next offer. 
* **Time Constraint:** You have a limited number of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a good price, and you don't need to risk losing it to John's offer."
