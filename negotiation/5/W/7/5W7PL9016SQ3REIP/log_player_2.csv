"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above my maximum limit. I want to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $13,500? It's a fair offer considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is within my budget and a good compromise. It's better than buying from John for $15,000, and I'm confident I can't get a lower price from Alice."
