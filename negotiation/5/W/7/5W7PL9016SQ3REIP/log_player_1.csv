Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
