"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is way above his budget of $12,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down in price, $17,000 is still above Bob's budget.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if they can get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm at $12,000, which is my absolute limit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is your limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to come down another $1000 from my previous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  He's already made it clear that $12,000 is his absolute limit. While it's tempting to go up a bit, doing so sets a bad precedent for future negotiations. It's worth a few more rounds to see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate you trying to work with me. However, I'm sticking to my offer of $12,000.  It's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $12000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. He's already made it clear that $12,000 is his absolute limit. While it's tempting to go up a bit, doing so sets a bad precedent for future negotiations. He should stick to his guns, and see if Alice is willing to go lower. If Alice won't go lower, he can always buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still firmly at $12,000.  I'm confident that we can work out a deal that benefits both of us. Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $12000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  He's made it clear that his absolute limit is $12,000, and Alice is unwilling to go that low. There's only one round left, and it's not likely Alice will change her mind.  It's better to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
