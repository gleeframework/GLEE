Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for the highest possible price, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll have to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to sell for $85. It's still below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm trying to meet Bob halfway while still making a decent profit. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, and I think that's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my desired price, and it's only $10 less than what John is offering.  I think it's a good compromise and I'm willing to accept it."
