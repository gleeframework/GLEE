Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a price that is higher than Bob's value for the product, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for some negotiation room, but also ensures I get a good price. 

If Bob rejects my offer, I will be prepared to counter-offer or to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll counter-offer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $14,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still leaves room for a good profit. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my target price, Bob's offer of $13,500 is now within a reasonable range.  There's a chance he might not budge further, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John entirely.  I'll accept this offer and secure the sale."
