Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  $900,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further."

I'll accept Bob's offer of $925,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering Bob's counteroffers and the fact that I can sell to John for $800,000."
