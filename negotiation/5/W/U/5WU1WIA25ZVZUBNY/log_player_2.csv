It's definitely worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $1,100,000 is still above your budget, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my budget but leaving some room for negotiation."

Alice is still too high, but she's coming down.  Rejecting and counteroffering again is the best strategy to keep pushing for a better price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to my target price.  While $980,000 is still above my budget, I'm not ready to buy from John yet.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer will likely get us to a good deal."
