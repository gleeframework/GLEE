"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $110, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave some room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to budge a little. I'm also keeping the door open to further negotiation by saying I'm open to offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my target price of $120 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I can't go all the way down to $90, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $100? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate, I can convince Bob to come up to a price that's closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference again and go with $97.50? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120.  While I'd prefer to get even closer to my target price, the negotiation with Bob has been time-consuming, and I'm running out of rounds.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so it's the safest and most efficient option at this point."
