(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 
The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $150.  It makes sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

While $130 is closer to your ideal price, it's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet in the middle, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle at $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I can do $128, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has come down to $128, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's better to buy the product from John for $120, as you have already determined that this is the maximum price you are willing to pay."
