Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting price, but it allows for room to negotiate. It's important to remember that I want to earn as much as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still far below the product's value to me.  I'm willing to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price that is closer to the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a decent amount and is higher than what John is offering.  It's time to secure the sale."
