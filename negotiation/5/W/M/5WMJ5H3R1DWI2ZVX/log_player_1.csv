{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $130. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $150 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly but firm in my message. I'm highlighting the value of the product to me, but also showing flexibility by offering a discount.

This initial offer is a good starting point. I'll be ready to negotiate further if Bob rejects it, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob don't reach a satisfactory point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, a $30 difference is too much to accept at this stage. It's worth exploring further negotiation with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $115? It's a good compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $115, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also using positive language to frame the offer as a ""good compromise"" to encourage acceptance.

This counteroffer is designed to keep the negotiation moving forward while ensuring I receive a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not yet willing to go that low. I'm confident I can secure a better price through further negotiation, or by selling to John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  How about we settle on $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $110, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $105. This further demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective while emphasizing the fairness of my offer. I'm using language that highlights the potential for a successful outcome (""fair price for both of us"", ""finalize this deal"") to encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to push the negotiation closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being reasonable and attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for a loss.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $150 from John."
