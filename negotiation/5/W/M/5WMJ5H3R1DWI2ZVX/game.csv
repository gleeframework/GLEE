"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $115? It's a good compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  How about we settle on $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",100.0,Bob,6,
