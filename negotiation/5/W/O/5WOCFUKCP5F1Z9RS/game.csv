"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $1,025,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
