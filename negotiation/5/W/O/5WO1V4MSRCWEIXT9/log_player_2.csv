I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $900,000. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, $775,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $825,000. It's clear she's using a strategy of halving the difference, and we're reaching the limit of her flexibility. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed offer for $800,000 from John."
