Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies high demand and value without explicitly stating a reason for the price. This creates a sense of scarcity and potential for Bob to perceive a deal if he negotiates down. 
* **Leaving Room:** By offering it at $12,000, there's a chance Bob might negotiate down to a price still higher than your $10,000 guarantee, maximizing your potential profit."
