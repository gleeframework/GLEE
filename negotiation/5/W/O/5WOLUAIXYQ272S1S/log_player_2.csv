"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $95 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $100 to Bob, but Alice is only asking for $95. This is a good deal, but Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $80 to Alice, so he's offering a price that is closer to that value. This will hopefully encourage Alice to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. He knows the product is worth $80 to Alice and is willing to negotiate further.  Rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  How about $87? It's closer to my budget, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 87} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. He's offering a price that's closer to Alice's desired price, but still within his budget. This compromise shows that he's serious about buying the product, but also willing to negotiate."
