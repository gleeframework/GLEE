"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It allows you to acquire the product for a price below its value to you, and it gives me a strong return on my investment. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This price is still above your value for the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit margin for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still too far from my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1,090,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
