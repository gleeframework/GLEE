Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob first is preferable to avoid potential delays or complications. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer. The price is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), giving you a strong starting point.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" you create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to act quickly."
