"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you, and it leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth to me. However, I am hoping to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price, perhaps around $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $950,000 is a good starting point, I'm still invested in getting a fair price for this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This allows for a compromise that benefits us both. Let me know your thoughts.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
