I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant amount above my minimum price of $1,500,000, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum, so I'm not taking a significant risk.  This strategy allows me to potentially maximize my profit while still having a guaranteed fallback option."
