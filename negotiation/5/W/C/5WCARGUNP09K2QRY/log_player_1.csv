Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob, giving you significant bargaining power.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $130 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still nets you a significant profit. 
* **Avoiding a Counter-Offer:**  A high initial offer might discourage Bob from countering, as he'll want to secure the deal before you consider selling to John. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** This price is well above your minimum acceptable price ($80), ensuring you make a good profit regardless. 

By starting high but still leaving room for potential negotiation, you maximize your chances of getting the best possible price from Bob."
