"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate and still allows me a good profit. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly, emphasizing the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I aim to maximize my potential earnings while still keeping the deal open. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in the next round, but I have John as a safety net if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'll use this round to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving room for compromise. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.  If he rejects again, I'll consider lowering my price further, but I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get a little closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,250? I think this price would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $12,500. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** I'm reinforcing my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement by highlighting the ""fair compromise"" aspect of my counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise, I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he accepts, I'll secure a decent profit. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering my price further, but I'm still prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to consider another round of negotiation to try and get a slightly better price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above Bob's current offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.  If he rejects again, I'll consider lowering my price further, but I'm still prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $13,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit and ensures you get a great product within your budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing a price that's a slight compromise from my last offer, showing flexibility. It's still above Bob's current offer, but closer to his budget.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair"" aspect of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to close the deal. I'm now getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation if needed. If Bob rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my target price, but I'm still a bit off. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,900? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a serious commitment if we can meet on price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,900 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal. 

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and secures a profit. With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential reward of a higher price."
