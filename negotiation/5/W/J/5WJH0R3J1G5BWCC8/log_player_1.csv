Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is intentionally above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) to test his willingness to pay a premium. While it's unlikely he'll accept this initial offer, it sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Below John's Offer:** The price is still comfortably below your guaranteed sale price to John ($10,000), ensuring you'll still make a profit if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** This is an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price if Bob counters or expresses disinterest. The goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of you."
