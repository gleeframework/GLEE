"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $12,500?  I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,250 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this - how about $11,875? It's a fair price for both of us.",11875.0,Alice,5,
