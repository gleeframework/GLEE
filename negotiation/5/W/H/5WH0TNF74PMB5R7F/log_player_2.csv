"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. I'm offering it to you for $7,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save money, so accepting Alice's first offer isn't the best strategy.  You can try to get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested, but $7,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $6,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $6,900. This is a compromise that I think will satisfy both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $6,900 is a good compromise.  You're saving $1,100 compared to John's price, and it's likely Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting now is the best course of action."
