Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth significantly more to you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I have 9 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,150,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good investment."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet halfway between our last offers -  $1,075,000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to walk away with a positive outcome.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still significantly below what I consider a fair price. I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can reach a better agreement.  While $1,075,000 is tempting, I'm confident I can get closer to $1,100,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,075,000 is still too far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,090,000.  This shows I'm serious about making a deal, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 1090000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  How about we meet at $1,080,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting very close to my desired price. With only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep negotiating.  While I'd like to get closer to $1,100,000, accepting $1,080,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant amount of money, and I'm confident that it's a fair deal for both of us."
