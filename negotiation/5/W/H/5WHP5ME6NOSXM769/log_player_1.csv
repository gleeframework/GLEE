# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm confident we can find a compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can find a more agreeable price point.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find common ground. While $925,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping we can bridge the gap.

While I would prefer a higher price, I recognize that Bob has reached his limit and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer of $900,000 is the best outcome at this point, as it's closer to my minimum and secures a sale."
