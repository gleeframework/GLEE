"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $155. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",155.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $155 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $140. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",140.0,Alice,5,
