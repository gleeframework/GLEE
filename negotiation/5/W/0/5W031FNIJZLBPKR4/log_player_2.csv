You have three options:

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice.  $12,000 is still too high."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still give you a great deal, and it's a fair price for the value I'm offering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

$10,500 is still a bit more than I wanted to pay, but it's closer to my budget and a better deal than going with John.  I'll take it!"
