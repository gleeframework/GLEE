Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product while being open to negotiation.

**Why this is a good starting point:**

* **Maximizing profit:**  $12,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you a chance to secure a good profit.
* **Negotiation space:** Leaving room for negotiation allows for a potential compromise, increasing the chances of a deal.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** This offer is high enough that you're not immediately forced to accept John's offer, but it also incentivizes Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to pay $9,500 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and get a better price in the next round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still give you a great deal, and it's a fair price for the value I'm offering. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing $10,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and acknowledges Bob's offer, while emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of the new price.

**Rationale:**

* **Finding a middle ground:**  This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that's acceptable to both parties, increasing the chances of a deal.
* **Remaining above John's offer:**  $10,500 is still significantly higher than John's offer, meaning I'm not pressured to sell to him immediately.
* **Maintaining negotiation leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer outright, I maintain the leverage to potentially negotiate a higher price in the next round."
