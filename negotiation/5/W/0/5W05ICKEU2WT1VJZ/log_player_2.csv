I'm confident you'll find it a great deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a lower price."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to my desired price.  Buying from John would cost me significantly more, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
