"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $100. Would you be willing to do $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see him moving closer to a price that works for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $110 is too low for me. This product is really valuable and I'm confident you'd benefit from it. How about we meet in the middle at $150?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still outside my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is slowly moving towards my minimum price, but I'm still willing to hold out a bit longer to see if I can get closer to my desired profit margin. $125 is still a significant difference from my $150 minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly interested in the product and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. $125 is still a bit low for me. What if we settle at $140?  That's a pretty significant discount from my original offer."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $130. It's a fair compromise and gives you a decent price, while staying within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $130 gives a profit of $30, which is better than nothing and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
