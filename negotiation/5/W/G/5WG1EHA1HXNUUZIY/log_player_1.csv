Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your true valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested while still securing a great price for you. 
* **Polite and Professional Tone:**  The message aims to be inviting and highlight the product's value to Bob without being overly aggressive."
