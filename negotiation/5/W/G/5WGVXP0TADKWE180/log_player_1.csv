Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This is a strong opening position, and it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Knowing My Minimum:** I am aware that my minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000, so I'm not afraid to reject low counteroffers. 
* **Strategic Bargaining:**  By starting high, I'm setting a benchmark and forcing Bob to reveal how much he truly values the product. This allows me to adjust my strategy based on his response. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:**  The existence of John as a backup buyer gives me a safety net and confidence to be assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, it's still lower than the $1,500,000 I initially offered.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation and a potential for a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and explore a higher price point.
* **Strategic Bargaining:** By rejecting his offer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to maximizing my profit. This can encourage Bob to come back with a higher counteroffer. 
* **Considering ""John"":** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm not willing to settle for that yet.  My goal is to see if I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finding the Middle Ground:**  My counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a compromise between my initial offer of $1,500,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Showcasing Flexibility:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:**  By presenting a fair and reasonable counteroffer, I'm aiming to incentivize Bob to accept, leading to a successful transaction.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not giving up too much ground, so I still have leverage if Bob rejects this offer and we continue the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:** I've already lowered my price twice, and Bob's counteroffer shows that he's not willing to meet my minimum requirements.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him rejecting my offer and leaving me with no sale. Selling to John is the safer and more predictable option."
