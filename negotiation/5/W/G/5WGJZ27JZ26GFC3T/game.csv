"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $90 is tempting, I'm really looking to get closer to $100 for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $95 is still a little high for me. I'm really hoping to get it for $92. What do you think?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $92 is a good offer. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.  How about $94? That's only a couple of dollars away from your offer, and it's closer to what I need.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but $94 is still a bit high. How about we split the difference again and go with $93?",93.0,Bob,6,
