"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without me immediately feeling like I need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, and I want to see if he's willing to go higher. 
* **Avoiding the ""John"" option:**  While selling to John for $100 is a safe option, it's not the most profitable. I'm hoping I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $90 is tempting, I'm really looking to get closer to $100 for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my desired price and Bob's offer.
* **Staying firm:** I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive language:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $95 is still a little high for me. I'm really hoping to get it for $92. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $92 is still below my minimum of $100, it's getting closer.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm hoping that with a few more rounds, I can convince Bob to go a little higher.
* **Avoiding ""John"" for now:**  I'm still trying to maximize my profit and believe there's a chance I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. $92 is a good offer. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.  How about $94? That's only a couple of dollars away from your offer, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm only asking for $2 more than Bob's offer, which shows I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Highlighting the closeness:**  I emphasize that $94 is ""only a couple of dollars away"" to make it seem like a minor difference.
* **Staying above the minimum:** I'm still above my minimum of $100, but getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but $94 is still a bit high. How about we split the difference again and go with $93? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the minimum:** While $93 isn't ideal, it's only $7 below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** We're already at round 6, and I'm worried that further negotiations might not yield a better price.
* **Avoiding the ""John"" option:**  Selling to John for $100 is still a good option, but I'm choosing to take a slightly lower offer from Bob to avoid the risk of further negotiation failures."
