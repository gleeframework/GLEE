"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. My asking price is $110, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and counter with a price closer to your acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was hoping to spend closer to $60. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your actual target price. This leaves room for bargaining and gives the impression you might be willing to meet in the middle. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is courteous but clearly states that the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Target in Mind:** While the offer is $60, the goal is to get the product for under $80.  This leaves room for Alice to counter and potentially reach a price acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but $90 is still above your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and you have the backup option of John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair offer and closer to what I had in mind."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** This offer is a strong move toward your target price while still leaving some wiggle room for a final agreement.
* **Justification:**  By stating it's ""closer to what I had in mind,"" you imply this offer is getting closer to your limit, encouraging Alice to consider it seriously.
* **Backup in Mind:** You're still below John's offer, preserving your fallback option if Alice rejects this counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm open to negotiation.  $75 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle on $85? It's closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85. While you *might* be able to haggle her down a little more, it's risky. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80, which is within your budget and saves you the uncertainty of further negotiation."
