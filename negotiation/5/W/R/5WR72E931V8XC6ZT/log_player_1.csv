Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're still making a profit of $3,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has incentive to counteroffer since he values the product higher.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  If Bob rejects, you can still make a decent profit by selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is more than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000). There's room to negotiate further and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but I need to be careful with my expenses. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is still less than your initial offer, it's closer to your target price of $12,000.  It's also important to consider:

* **Bob's limited budget:** He's shown he's willing to negotiate, but he's also clear about his budget constraints. 
* **John's offer:**  $11,500 is significantly better than the $10,000 you'd get from John.

At this point, it's wise to accept the offer and secure a decent profit. There's always a risk of further negotiation going sour, potentially leading to a lower price or even a failed deal."
