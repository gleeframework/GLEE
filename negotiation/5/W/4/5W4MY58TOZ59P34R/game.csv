"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise. This gives you a good price, and saves me money.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is still a good deal for you, but closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
