"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise. This gives you a good price, and saves me money."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is still a good deal for you, but closer to my minimum price. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer is still above his budget, and he's already had several rounds of negotiation. Buying from John ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
