"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering what you could gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($1,150,000) is higher than your maximum price from John ($1,200,000).** 
* **You have room to negotiate.** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price.  There's a chance she might come back with a lower offer closer to her value of $1,000,000. 

Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate down further."
