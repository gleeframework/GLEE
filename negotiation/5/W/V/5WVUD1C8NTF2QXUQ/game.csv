"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $850,000 is still too far below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to facilitate a deal. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I understand your position, $900,000 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is a final offer that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair outcome. Let me know if you're able to accept.",925000.0,Alice,5,
