Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John, so it's not worth accepting Alice's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $850,000 is still too far below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to facilitate a deal. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob should reject the offer. While $950,000 is closer to his maximum, he can still get the product for a lower price from John, making it more beneficial to continue negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I understand your position, $900,000 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is a final offer that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair outcome. Let me know if you're able to accept.

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than what John is offering.  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation.  John offers the best deal available to Bob."
