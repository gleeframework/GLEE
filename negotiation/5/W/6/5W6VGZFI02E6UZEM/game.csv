"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider coming down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $825,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
