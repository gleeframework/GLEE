"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we split the difference at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,500, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free premium service package worth $1,000. That brings the total value to $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the added value of the service package, but I'm still looking for a lower price on the product itself. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which includes the value of the service package. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000, but I'm willing to throw in an additional service package worth $500. That brings the total value to $13,500. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $13,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. My final offer is $12,500. This is a fair price that's within our budget and allows us to both get a good deal. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. I'm willing to make one final concession: I'll include a 6-month warranty on the product, which is a $1,000 value. That brings the total value to $14,500. This is my final offer. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,9,
