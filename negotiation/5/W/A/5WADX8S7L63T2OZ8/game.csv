"Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product! We're excited to discuss the details with you. As we value this product highly, we're willing to start with an offer of $600,000. We believe this is a fair price considering its exceptional quality and features.",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $600,000 is significantly below my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not quite ready to meet you at $750,000. We're willing to compromise and offer you the product for $725,000. This price still reflects the value we place on the product, but it's a bit more reasonable considering your budget. We're open to further discussion and hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $737,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to meet in the middle.",737500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, we're not quite ready to meet you at $737,500. We're willing to consider a slightly lower price, but we're still looking for a better return on our investment. We're willing to offer you the product for $720,000. This price still reflects the value we place on the product, but it's a bit more reasonable considering your budget. We're open to further discussion and hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",720000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $720,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to offer $725,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals.",725000.0,Bob,6,
