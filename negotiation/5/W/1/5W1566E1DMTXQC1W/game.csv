"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more than I would get from John.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your original ask, Alice. How about $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.",100.0,Alice,5,
