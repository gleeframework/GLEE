Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that the price is justified without explicitly stating Bob's perceived value.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning listing the product publicly, you introduce a subtle sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to make a decision quicker. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant."
