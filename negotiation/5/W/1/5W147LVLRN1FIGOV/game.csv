"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will be a game changer for your business. I've set the price at $950,000, reflecting its value and potential. I'm confident this is a fair offer, and I'm open to discussing it further. Let's talk!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant opportunity.  What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $787,500?",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000, which is closer to your offer but still ensures I can cover my costs.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you, and I believe we can make this happen.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right that we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is a very fair price, and I'm eager to finalize the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
