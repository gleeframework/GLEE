I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit.  I'll use John as my safety net, but I'll try to get as much as possible from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can do better. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a higher profit than Bob's offer. This should keep the negotiation going and hopefully lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm going to counter again, hopefully closing the gap further."

I'm lowering my price again, this time to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's a fair price that still gives me a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Bob's offer is only slightly above what I could get from John.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation at this point.  I'll sell to John and secure the guaranteed profit."
