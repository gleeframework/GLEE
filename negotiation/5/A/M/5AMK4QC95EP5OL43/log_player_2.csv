"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1200000.  This is a significant value for you, as it's well below the $1500000 it's worth to you. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know your decision by [date/time].  If you decline, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
