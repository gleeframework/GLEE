Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize your potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting near that figure is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While you have a backup offer, there's a chance Bob might negotiate down slightly. Starting high provides that buffer.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  $11,500 is a significant markup from your minimum but doesn't completely exploit Bob's maximum valuation. It positions you as confident but fair."
