"I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $925,000, so I'll offer $862,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $862,500 is simply not enough for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down further, but I need to be closer to my minimum. Let's try $900,000. This price is fair to both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $885,000, but no higher. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",885000.0,Bob,6,
