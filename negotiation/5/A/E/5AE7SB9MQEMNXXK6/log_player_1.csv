{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit lower than my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers. I'm keeping John in mind as my fallback option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate with him further.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $10,000, Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum. It's still a good deal for me considering his original offer, and I want to avoid potentially losing out on the sale completely.  I'll accept his offer."
