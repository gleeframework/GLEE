"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's significantly more than your $800,000 maximum and even above Alice's perceived value. Rejecting this offer and providing a counteroffer is the best strategy to move the negotiation towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer, but $1,800,000 is simply not within a reasonable range for me. This product has value, but I'm looking at something closer to $900,000.  I believe that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $900,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $1,450,000 is still significantly higher than your target price and what you'd pay John.  Continuing to negotiate is the best option for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me to consider.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we try $1,100,000? This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I believe it shows how committed I am to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious, and I respect that. Let's close this gap. How about $1,300,000? This is my final offer, as it significantly cuts into my margin but recognizes our desire to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice states this is her final offer, it's still significantly above your target price.  There's room for negotiation, and you're better off seeing if she'll come down further, especially since she's claiming it cuts into her margin significantly. You can always go to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I need you to understand where I'm coming from as well. $1,300,000 is just too big of a gap from what I'm willing to pay. If you can't do better than that, I'm afraid I'll have to seriously consider John's offer. To show you I'm still very interested, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a substantial commitment from my end, and I hope you can see it as a path forward for us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
