"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  That's my absolute top limit.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",11000.0,Alice,3,
