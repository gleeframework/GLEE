# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  That's my absolute top limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
