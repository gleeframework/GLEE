"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about $115?  I'm really hoping to get this deal done, and I think this price is a fair middle ground.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $122?  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on this.",122.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're making a final offer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $122. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to give away the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $122. How about $121.50? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",121.5,Alice,7,
