"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $950000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive:** $950,000 is a significant discount from your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **But, there's room for negotiation:** It's highly likely Alice is willing to come down further, especially since this is the first round.  

**Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a better price and open the door for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Given the product's potential, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $850,000? "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counter:** This is a significant counteroffer, showing Alice that you are serious about negotiating.  
* **Reasoning:** I've provided a reason for my counteroffer,  emphasizing the product's potential to justify the price.
* **Fair Offer:** $850,000 is still a good deal for Alice, but it gives you a substantial discount and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice has met you halfway, coming down from her initial offer of $950,000.
* **Value vs. Risk:**  While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice becoming less flexible or the negotiation dragging on unnecessarily.
* **Time Consideration:** You have limited rounds, and accepting now is a good way to secure the product at a fair price without jeopardizing the deal.

**Conclusion:**  $875,000 is a significant saving compared to your maximum budget, and it's reasonable to accept this offer to avoid potential complications."
