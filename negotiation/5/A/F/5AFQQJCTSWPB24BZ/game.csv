"Alice,  $950000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Given the product's potential, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $850000? ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,
