"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $130. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
