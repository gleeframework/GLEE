Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting high ($950,000) leaves room for negotiation. It also:
    * Signals the product's high value to Bob.
    * Allows you to potentially secure a price closer to your ideal outcome. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with John."
