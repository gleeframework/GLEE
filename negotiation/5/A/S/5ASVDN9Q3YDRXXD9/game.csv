"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $10,800 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high. How about we meet in the middle at $9,900?",9900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer it to you for $10,550. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10550.0,Alice,5,
