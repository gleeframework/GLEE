Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is higher than your minimum of $80. 
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $150, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can adjust the price based on Bob's response.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin. You have room to negotiate with Bob and aim for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $100? That would still leave me some profit and hopefully be fair for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate, but not give away the whole profit margin.
* **Is still lower than your initial offer:**  This demonstrates flexibility.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  You can still go lower if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I could probably do $95, but that's about as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, accepting Bob's offer of $95 is the best option here.  It's a good compromise:

* **It's above my minimum:**  $95 is significantly higher than selling to John.
* **It's within a reasonable range:**  Bob's offer isn't drastically lower than my last counteroffer.
* **It avoids further negotiation:**  Continued negotiations might lead to a lower price, and there's always the risk Bob will walk away."
