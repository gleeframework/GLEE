"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but also leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price is attractive to Bob, considering the product is worth $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to $10,000. There are still several rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I think the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $9,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
