{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $95 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also friendly and open-ended, encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is more than John's offer, it's still below my minimum of $80.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $78 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. At this point,  I'm going to take John's offer and sell to him for $80. It's less than I hoped for, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob, and potentially going even lower."
