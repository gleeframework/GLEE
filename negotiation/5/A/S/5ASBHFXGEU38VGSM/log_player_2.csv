This product, tailored to meet your specific needs and desires, is priced at $1,150,000. My goal is to ensure that we achieve a fair transaction that maximizes the benefits for both parties involved. I believe this price offers an excellent balance between the intrinsic worth of the product and your valuation of it. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is under your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John at $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might be able to get the price closer to John's offer or even lower."
