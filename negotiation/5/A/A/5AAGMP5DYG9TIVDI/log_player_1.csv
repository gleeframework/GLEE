Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $937,500, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a good midpoint for us to agree on. Let's close this deal.

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly holding firm, and getting $937,500 is a significant gain over risking further negotiation and potentially ending up closer to his original offer, or even having to settle for John's $1,200,000.  It's a good business decision to accept now."
