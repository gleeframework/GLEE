"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I know I can get it for $80 from John, so I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $77.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good. However,  I'm aiming to get the price closer to $70.  It's worth seeing if she'll budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about $70? That's a fair price, and we can close the deal right now."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This counter-offer holds firm at a price point that works well for me. 
* **Sense of urgency:**  By mentioning ""closing the deal right now,"" I'm subtly implying that I might consider other options if this offer isn't acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $72.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price I'm willing to accept. However, there's still a $2.50 difference between her offer and John's price. I'm going to try one more time to see if I can get her closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice! Tell you what, how about we split the difference and call it $71.25? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 71.25
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:**  This is a classic negotiation tactic that seems fair to both parties. 
* **""Final offer""**:  By stating this is my final offer, I'm adding a touch of urgency. 
* **Getting close to John's price:** While I'd love to get it for $70, $71.25 is still a good deal compared to John's $80. If Alice rejects this, I'll likely go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the effort, Bob, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about $73.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $73.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $73.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is no longer negotiating in good faith. She went up from her previous offer, indicating she's not interested in meeting me closer to my price. At this point, it's not worth continuing the negotiation.  John's offer of $80 is more appealing than wasting more time with Alice."
