Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $130 is more than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $130 is less than what Bob values the product at, making it a potential win for him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You have space to adjust the price if Bob counteroffers. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  I think this is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
