"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a significantly high offer ($2,250,000) anchors the negotiation in our favor. While it's above both our minimum and Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows us to secure a price closer to our desired outcome. 
* **Justification:** We provide a vague but positive justification (""unique value"", ""significant return on investment"") to avoid revealing specific details about the product's worth to us while piquing Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language emphasizes this is a ""starting point,"" signaling our willingness to negotiate and potentially making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in the process.

This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while leaving room to maneuver in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,250,000 is simply too high for me. Given my research, and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This offer is fair, reflects the product's value, and allows us to both come to an agreeable conclusion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to his perceived value, accepting now would mean a substantial loss for us.  We have room to negotiate and are better off seeing if we can bring him closer to our range.  Selling to John at this point would be a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential and scarcity of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this adjustment demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession by dropping $300,000 from our initial offer. This signals flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in keeping Bob engaged. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** Despite the concession, we're still well above both Bob's offer and our minimum price, preserving our negotiating power.
* **Reiterating Value:** We subtly remind Bob of the product's unique qualities (""true potential and scarcity"") to justify the high price point without revealing specific details. 
* **Positive Framing:** Emphasizing our ""commitment to a mutually beneficial agreement"" fosters goodwill and encourages Bob to reciprocate with concessions of his own."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I see we're getting closer.  However,  $1,950,000 is still more than I can justify.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges both the value and the need for compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more in further negotiation, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
