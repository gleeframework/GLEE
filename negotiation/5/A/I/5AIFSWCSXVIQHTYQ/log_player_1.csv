"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique advantages and its value goes beyond those comparisons. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is closer to my initial offer. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and willing to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is a significant sum, we are still early in the negotiation and have room to push for a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,225,000? It's a compromise I'm willing to make to get this deal done."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, which is the same price I offered in round 4. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is anchoring heavily on $1,150,000, but he hasn't walked away. This suggests there's still some wiggle room. We're getting closer to the point where John's offer becomes more appealing, but we have a few rounds left to try and secure a better deal from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your consistency, but I need you to meet me a bit closer to my valuation for this deal to work.  How about we split the difference - $1,187,500 and we shake hands on it?"",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is a bit more than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the market value. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now increased his offer from his original point and come down from his price anchoring.  While it's less than we hoped for, it's still a significant profit above our minimum, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a substantially better outcome. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob walking away and secures a good deal."
