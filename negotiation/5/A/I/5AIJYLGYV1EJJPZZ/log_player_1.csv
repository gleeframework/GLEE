Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,400,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.
