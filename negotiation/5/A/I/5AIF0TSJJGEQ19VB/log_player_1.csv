Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I am willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Bob is willing to pay the minimum I'm willing to accept, it's more beneficial to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation."
