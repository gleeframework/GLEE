"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,100,000?  That's still a good deal for both of us, and it gives us both room to make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your original offer, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
