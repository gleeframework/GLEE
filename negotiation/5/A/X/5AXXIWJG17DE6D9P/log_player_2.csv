"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. How about we try $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John for $100 guarantees you get the product at your target price."
