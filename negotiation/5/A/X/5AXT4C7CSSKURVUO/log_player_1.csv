Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot. I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get closer to my desired value.  I'm also trying to build a rapport with Bob by being friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $125 for this.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and do $100? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer more, Bob's offer of $100 is the maximum he's willing to pay.  It's better to secure the sale at this price rather than risk him walking away completely.  I can then sell to John for $150 in the future if the opportunity arises."
