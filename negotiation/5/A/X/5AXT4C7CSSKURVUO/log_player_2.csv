"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot. I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price:** This leaves room for negotiation and shows Alice we're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **It's within our budget:** We're aiming for under $100, and this keeps us well below that.
* **It doesn't completely lowball Alice:** Offering a very low price (like $20) might offend Alice and make her less likely to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $125 for this.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $125 is still a ways off from our $100 limit. It's time to inch our offer up a little and see if she'll meet us closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and do $100? That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Going to our maximum:** This counteroffer is firm but fair. We're showing Alice we're serious by offering our absolute top price. 
* **Splitting the difference:** By suggesting a price directly in the middle of our previous offers ($80 and $125), it feels like a logical and reasonable compromise.
* **Finality:**  Including ""That's the highest I can go""  signals that this is our best and final offer, adding some pressure for Alice to accept."
