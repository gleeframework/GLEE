"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but it's not the best possible deal.**  You're aiming to save as much as possible, and there's room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds to work with.** This gives you time to try to get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  It's good to keep in mind, but it's not the ideal solution.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to $9,000 or even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This offer is $500 lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating your desire to negotiate. 
* **Within your budget:** It still leaves you with a $2,000 cushion before reaching your maximum price point. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your initial counteroffer, but still within your budget.** However, it's not the best possible deal, and there's still room for negotiation. 
* **You have 7 rounds left.** You can continue to try to push for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a backup option.** But you have time to try to get a better price from Alice. 

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price between $9,000 and $9,500. This shows you're serious about negotiating but are willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This offer is a compromise between your previous counteroffer of $9,000 and Alice's latest offer of $9,700. 
* **Moving closer to a deal:**  This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate but also sets a clear limit on how high you're willing to go. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  It still leaves you with a $2,750 cushion before reaching your maximum price. 

**Next Steps:**

Now you'll see if Alice is willing to meet you in the middle. If she rejects this offer, you might consider making a final counteroffer before moving on to John as a backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still not ideal.** You are only $600 away from your original counteroffer and still have 5 rounds left. 
* **You have time to negotiate further.** There's no need to rush into accepting a price that's not quite what you want. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** But you're closer to a good deal with Alice, so it's still worth trying to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

Make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price between $9,400 and $9,600. This shows you're serious about getting a good deal but are also willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is halfway between Alice's latest offer of $9,800 and your previous offer of $9,250.
* **Showing compromise:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and reach a deal.
* **Still within your budget:**  It leaves you with $1,500 in your budget, providing a good buffer.

**Next Steps:**

If Alice rejects this offer, you have a couple of options:

* **Final counteroffer:** Make one last counteroffer, perhaps $9,600, to see if Alice is willing to budge. 
* **Move to John:**  If Alice remains inflexible, it might be time to move to John as your backup option to avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she's getting closer to your desired price, you're only $400 away from your last counteroffer.
* **You still have 3 rounds left.**  There's time to keep pushing for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a viable option, but you're close to a good deal with Alice.** It's worth continuing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

Make a final counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price between $9,600 and $9,700. You can state that this is your final offer before turning to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This offer is a strong compromise, showing you're serious about closing the deal but also standing firm on your price.
* **Close to your goal:** You're only $300 away from your target price, and it's unlikely Alice will go lower.
* **Setting a deadline:**  If she rejects this offer, you'll be ready to move to John as your backup plan.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge further:**  She's only offered $50 lower than her previous offer, indicating she's firm on her price.
* **You have one round left:**  It's unlikely you'll be able to secure a better deal in this final round.
* **Buying from John ensures you get the product:**  While you're not getting the absolute lowest price, you're within your budget and can secure the product without further negotiation.

**Decision:** 

It's time to cut your losses and move to John to finalize the purchase. While it's not the ideal outcome, it's the most practical choice given the limited time and the likelihood that Alice won't go lower."
