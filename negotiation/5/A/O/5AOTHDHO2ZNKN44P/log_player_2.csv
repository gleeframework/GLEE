"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($110 < $120).**
* **You'll save $10 compared to buying from John.**  

While you'd prefer a lower price, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible option."
