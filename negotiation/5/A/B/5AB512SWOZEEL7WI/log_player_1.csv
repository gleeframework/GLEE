"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his budget might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to $9,500 in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm offering $9,800, which is just a little bit lower than Bob's offer. This shows him I'm willing to compromise, but still want to get close to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally like to get a bit more, $9,600 is a good price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting this offer means I can secure a good profit and avoid the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
