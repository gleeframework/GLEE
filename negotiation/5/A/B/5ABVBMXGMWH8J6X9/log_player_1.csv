Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price of $11,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, it's always best to aim for the highest possible profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Appeal to Value:** The message highlights that the product is being offered at a ""discounted price,"" emphasizing value for Bob.

This approach attempts to secure a higher profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
