,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial price is based on the true potential and uniqueness of this product.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still far too high for me. Given my budget constraints, I can't go above $1,000,000 for this product. It's a significant offer, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position. I've tried to be realistic about the value of this product, and while your offer is tempting, it's still a substantial gap for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still limited by my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my serious intent to acquire this product, but it's the absolute maximum I can offer. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to keep working towards a deal.  I've been very transparent with you about the value I place on this product. To be completely frank, my absolute lowest price is $1,500,000. That's a firm offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
