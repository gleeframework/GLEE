"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Anchoring:** A high initial offer can psychologically ""anchor"" the negotiation, potentially influencing Bob to make counteroffers closer to your desired range. 
* **Signaling Value:**  The high price also reinforces the idea that you believe the product is highly valuable. 

By starting high, we can gain information about Bob's perception of the product's value and adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. Accepting would result in a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, it's still early in the negotiation with Bob. There's room to explore if you can bridge the gap and reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial price is based on the true potential and uniqueness of this product.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  The counteroffer makes a $300,000 reduction, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum price. 
* **Holding Firm:** The message reiterates the product's value and explains the reasoning behind the initial high price. This emphasizes that you're not easily budging and believe in the product's worth. 

The goal is to signal flexibility while maintaining a strong position. This encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still far too high for me. Given my budget constraints, I can't go above $1,000,000 for this product. It's a significant offer, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased considerably, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. Selling to John would net you more at this point. However, there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and you might be able to secure a deal closer to your desired range.  Let's see if we can encourage him to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position. I've tried to be realistic about the value of this product, and while your offer is tempting, it's still a substantial gap for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's latest offer ($1,000,000) and your previous price ($2,000,000). It signals fairness and a strong desire to find a compromise.
* **Above Minimum, But Room for Negotiation:**  This price is still comfortably above your minimum, but leaves some space for further negotiation if needed.
* **Urgency and Commitment:**  By framing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" you emphasize a sense of urgency and your willingness to close the deal.

This counteroffer aims to encourage Bob to make a significant move closer to your desired price point while keeping the negotiation active."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still limited by my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my serious intent to acquire this product, but it's the absolute maximum I can offer. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision point. Bob has made another significant jump, and his offer is now closer to your guaranteed sale with John. However, it's still below your minimum, and you have some negotiation rounds left. It's worth seeing if you can push Bob a little further, but the next counteroffer should signal that you're nearing your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to keep working towards a deal.  I've been very transparent with you about the value I place on this product. To be completely frank, my absolute lowest price is $1,500,000. That's a firm offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This message conveys that this is your absolute bottom line and you're not budging. It's time for Bob to make a decision.
* **Transparency and Justification:**  Reiterating your transparency about the product's value reinforces your position without seeming overly aggressive.
* **Clear Expectations:** By stating that this is your final offer, you remove any ambiguity and create a sense of urgency for Bob. 

This counteroffer puts the ball squarely in Bob's court. He can either accept your final price or walk away from the deal. You've maximized your negotiating position, and it's now up to Bob to determine the outcome."
