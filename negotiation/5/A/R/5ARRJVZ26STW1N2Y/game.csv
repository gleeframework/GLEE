"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a compromise, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
