"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to go down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Would you be interested in that price?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a little hesitant at $130. How about we split the difference and go with $125? ",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $125. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we try $135? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for a great product like this.",135.0,Alice,5,
