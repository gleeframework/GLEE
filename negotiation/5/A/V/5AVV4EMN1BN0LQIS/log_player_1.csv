This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a good profit, but also wanting to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about we discuss a price closer to $800,000? I hope this suggestion sparks a productive conversation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  While $800,000 is still a profit, it's not close to the value I place on the product. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the compromise. However, I still believe there might be room for further discussion. How about considering $950,000 for the product? I hope this proposal will lead to a satisfactory agreement for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not in the range I'm comfortable with. While I could accept $950,000 and make a decent profit, I'm confident I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll counter with a price that's slightly higher to see if we can find common ground."
