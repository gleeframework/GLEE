# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,150,000. This is a significant price point for both of us, allowing you to secure this product for a price well below its worth to you.  However, if you choose not to accept, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay $1,200,000.  Let me know your decision, and we can proceed from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
