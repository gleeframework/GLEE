$18,000 is far more than your $8,000 limit.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

Let's start with the maximum you're willing to pay and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

$16,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

Let's try a price in the middle,  $10,000. This is still a significant discount from Alice's offer, but it might be more appealing to her than our previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

We're getting closer. Let's offer $12,000. This is still a good deal for Alice, but it gets us closer to our goal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$13,800 is still a bit high, but Alice is clearly getting closer to your desired price. You've only got a few rounds left, so try to get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

Let's try splitting the difference. $12,500 is a good compromise and could push Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and while $13,200 is getting closer to our goal, it's still above our limit. It's better to secure the product at a known price with John than risk getting a worse offer in the final round."
