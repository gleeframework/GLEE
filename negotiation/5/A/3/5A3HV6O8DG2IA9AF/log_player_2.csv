"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if I can get it lower.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Alice, so I'm not under immediate pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $500. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away.  It also leaves room for compromise in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has matched my counteroffer, which means we're at a point where we're both likely to be close to our desired price.  Accepting this offer saves me $1,500 compared to buying from John, and it's worth closing the deal to avoid further negotiation."
