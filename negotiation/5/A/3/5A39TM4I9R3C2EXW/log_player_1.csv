Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $18,000. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $18,000, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. Even if he counter-offers, it's less likely he'll go drastically below this initial price. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes some flexibility. If Bob immediately rejects the offer, you can always come back with a lower price, gradually moving towards your minimum of $12,000."
