"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're getting closer to a number you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
