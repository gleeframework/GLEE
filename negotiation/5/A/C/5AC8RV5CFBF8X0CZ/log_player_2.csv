"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting closer to a number you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very consistently sticking close to her original offer, and we're unlikely to get her much lower than $1,050,000.  Buying from John guarantees we stay within our budget and saves us at least $50,000."
