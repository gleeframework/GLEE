"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price that's still very fair, considering its potential worth.  Let's discuss a price of $10,000. This gives you a significant advantage and allows me to secure a good deal as well.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You are willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering the product for $10,000. 
* **You save money:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John. 

While you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price."
