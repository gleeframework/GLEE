"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This price represents a fair compromise and ensures a positive outcome for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $950,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,200,000.
* **It's a good compromise:**  Alice has moved from $1,000,000 to $950,000, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a fair price without risking a breakdown in the negotiation."
