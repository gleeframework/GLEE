""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business and would be a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. 
* **Finding a Balance:**  We don't want to scare Bob away with a price too close to our minimum ($1,200,000). Offering it slightly below that ($1,100,000) makes it attractive while still exceeding his perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, potentially landing us a final price even closer to our $1,200,000 minimum."
