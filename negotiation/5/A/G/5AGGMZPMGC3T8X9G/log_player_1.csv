Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing a deal above John's offer. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still being enticing enough to avoid him rejecting the offer outright."
