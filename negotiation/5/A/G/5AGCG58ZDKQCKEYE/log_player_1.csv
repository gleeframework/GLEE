Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by offering Bob the product at a price of $100. This is higher than my minimum price of $80, but still lower than the $120 that Bob is willing to pay.

{""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $90 is higher than my minimum price of $80, I'll choose option (3) and sell the product to John for $80.
