"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $10,000 is still too high for him, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,500 is better than her initial offer, he can still try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a little higher than I'd like to be. How about we split the difference at $9,000? I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm counteroffering at $9,250. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $9,250 is a good price for him, and it's unlikely he'll get a better deal from Alice.  While he could still try to negotiate further, it's risky. If Alice rejects his counteroffer, he'll have to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
