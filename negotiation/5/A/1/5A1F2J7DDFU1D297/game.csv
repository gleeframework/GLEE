"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a little higher than I'd like to be. How about we split the difference at $9,000? I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm counteroffering at $9,250. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",9250.0,Alice,5,
