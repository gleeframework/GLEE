Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's a great investment for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $950,000? That feels like a good compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 5
