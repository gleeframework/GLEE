"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain from this product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1100000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I've placed on it and the potential upside. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $1150000 is still a little more than I'm prepared to spend. I'm willing to offer $1125000 for the product. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the potential value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal and move on.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1125000 doesn't quite reflect the true potential of this product. Let's aim for a final compromise. I'm willing to offer it for $1137500. This is a small adjustment, but it represents the final price I'm comfortable with. I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm eager to move forward.",1137500.0,Alice,7,
