"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation and is below Bob's perceived value of the product. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A $9500 price leaves a comfortable margin for me.
* **Initiate negotiation:**  A high starting point encourages Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  If negotiations with Bob stall or become unfavorable, I can easily switch to John's guaranteed $8000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still lower than the $9,500 I initially offered. I want to see if I can push for a better deal. 

By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** It shows Bob I'm not desperate for a sale and willing to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Test the waters:** I can assess how determined Bob is to buy the product.
* **Increase my potential profit:** There's still room to negotiate a higher price.

However, I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if things don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $9,000, which is still below Bob's perceived value but closer to my desired price point. This approach aims to:

* **Maintain a strong position:** I'm not drastically lowering my price, showing that I'm confident in the product's worth.
* **Encourage compromise:**  Bob has already shown interest by making a counteroffer; I'm giving him a reasonable opportunity to meet me halfway.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still make adjustments in the subsequent rounds, keeping John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is only $250 lower than my previous counteroffer of $9,000.  Considering:

* **Time pressure:** We're already in round 4, and I want to avoid unnecessarily prolonging negotiations.
* **Close to my minimum:**  $8,750 is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **John's offer:** While I could potentially get a higher price, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether.  

Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale with a decent profit and minimizes the risk of getting a lower price or losing out on the deal entirely."
