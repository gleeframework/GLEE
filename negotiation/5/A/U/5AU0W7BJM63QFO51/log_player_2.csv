{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to me, so I can save money by negotiating with Alice.  I'll try to get a better price before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}

I'm starting with a lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still hoping to get a better price than $65, so I'll try making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but I'm still trying to stay below $65.  I think there's room for Alice to come down a little more."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $68. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $68
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep negotiating,  Alice's offer is close to my limit and I'm worried about running out of rounds.  It's a good price, and I don't want to risk having to buy from John at a higher cost."
