"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to start the negotiations at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While your initial offer is quite low, I recognize your interest.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the true value of the product, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  However, that revised price is still outside my budget. If you're serious about finding a buyer, I'd be willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a fair price.  I'm motivated to close this deal and I'm willing to consider offers closer to your price point.  How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000?  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my eagerness to work with you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down further.  That being said, $1,600,000 is still a big leap from my last offer. To be frank, I need to stay closer to my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise and shows my commitment to purchasing the product.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're very close. I respect your approach to this negotiation and believe we can find a mutually agreeable price.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to come up to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us and represents a significant investment on my part.",1350000.0,Bob,8,
