{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, which is significantly lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest while still securing a decent profit. If he rejects, I can lower the price further, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low for me. While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's still a good deal for you considering the product's value, and it's closer to what I need to get. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counter-offering at $100. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while giving Bob a better price than my initial offer.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him while still being within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his final offer of $80 is still too low for me.  I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $150. It's a guaranteed profit and a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer."
