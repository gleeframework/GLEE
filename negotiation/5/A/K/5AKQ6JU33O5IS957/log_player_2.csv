{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $9,500 is still too high for Bob, who values the product at $12,000. 
* **Better Option:**  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.  There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, so there's plenty of time to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so $8,500 is a good starting point for a counteroffer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By offering a price closer to Alice's perceived value, Bob increases the likelihood of Alice accepting the counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Better Option:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. With 7 rounds remaining, there's still time to try and get closer to his target.  It's likely Alice will reduce her offer further to avoid losing the deal altogether."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so Bob is offering a price that is closer to her value, but still within his budget.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By offering a higher price than the previous round ($8,500), Bob is showing willingness to compromise. This could encourage Alice to accept the offer or make a counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $8,000 to Alice. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round to show a willingness to compromise, but staying below Alice's current offer.  With fewer rounds remaining, Bob needs to make a more aggressive move to try and secure a deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,000 is still higher than what Bob wants to pay.
* **Better Option:** Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to counteroffer. Although the rounds are dwindling, Bob still has time to attempt to reach a more favorable price. It's possible Alice may be willing to make a final concession to close the deal.  

**It's getting risky.** Buying from John for $12,000 is a viable option at this point. However, with a few rounds remaining, Bob still has a chance to get a better deal with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $8,000 to Alice.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This is a high-risk, high-reward counteroffer.  Bob is significantly increasing his offer, demonstrating a genuine desire to close the deal. He is hoping Alice will accept, knowing that rejecting this offer could lead to her losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds remaining, Bob needs to make a strong move. This offer is close to Alice's likely minimum acceptable price.

**Outcome:**  

* **If Alice accepts:** Bob gets a good deal, saving $2,250 compared to John's offer.
* **If Alice rejects:**  Bob may need to accept John's offer to avoid losing the product entirely."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible, but ultimately buy the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,500 is still too high for Bob, and there's only one round left. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could make a counteroffer, the risk of Alice rejecting it and losing the deal is too high.  There's a high chance Alice will stick to her price or counter with a higher offer. 
* **Best Option:** Buying from John for $12,000 guarantees that Bob gets the product while still staying within his budget. 

**Conclusion:**  With only one round left, it's not worth the risk of trying to negotiate further. Buying from John ensures a successful transaction, even if it means a slightly higher price."
