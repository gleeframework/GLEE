"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion. What are your thoughts?

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,000,000? This price reflects the immense potential this product holds.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly substantial.  While I am open to negotiation,  $900,000 remains significantly below its worth.  Could you consider $975,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's potential.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my valuation. To be frank, taking anything less than $950,000 would be selling this product short of its true potential.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's price is coming down, she's clearly holding firm around the $950,000 mark.  At this point, the potential savings from continuing to negotiate with Alice are outweighed by the guaranteed savings of buying from John. It's time to cut bait and go with the sure thing."
