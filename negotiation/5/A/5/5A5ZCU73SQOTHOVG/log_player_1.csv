Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite, but I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  $850,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to drop that low, and I'm confident that I can get a better price from John. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
