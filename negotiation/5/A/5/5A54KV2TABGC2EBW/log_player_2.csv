"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $2,000,000 is above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for a lower price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1750000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $1900000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is a lower price than her initial offer, it is still above Bob's budget. He can get the same product from John for a lower price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1800000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1850000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,500,000. Although Alice's offer of $1,850,000 is lower than her previous offers, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  It's time to end the negotiation with Alice and secure the product at a lower price from John."
