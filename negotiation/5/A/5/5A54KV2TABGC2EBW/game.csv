"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $2000000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $1750000 for it.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1750000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $1900000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1900000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to pay $1800000. This is my final offer.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1800000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1850000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
