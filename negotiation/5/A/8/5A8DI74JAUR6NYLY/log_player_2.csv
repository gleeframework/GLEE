"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While you could buy from John for $120, Alice's offer of $110 is still a better deal for you. It saves you $10 compared to buying from John, and you still get the product for less than your maximum budget of $120."
