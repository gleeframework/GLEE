"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While $15,000 represents its true value, I'm open to negotiation. How about we meet halfway at $13,500?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $12,500 is a solid win. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and further negotiation risks losing him entirely."
