"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $15,000 reflects the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be upfront -  $11,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I can do $12,500, and that's my final offer. It's a great price considering the value you're getting.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Bob,6,
