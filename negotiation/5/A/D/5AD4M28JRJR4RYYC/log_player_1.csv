{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe would be a great asset to your operations. My asking price is $950,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its potential benefit to you.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've chosen $950,000 as my offer price. This leaves a good amount of profit for me while still being a significant discount for Bob compared to his perceived value.
* **Message:** The message is designed to be friendly, informative, and highlight the value proposition for Bob. It emphasizes the discount and opens the door for further discussion.

**Why this approach:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  This offer aims to get the highest possible price while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** While I'm confident Bob will accept, I've already secured a fallback buyer (John) to minimize risk.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  The message sets the stage for potential negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer."
