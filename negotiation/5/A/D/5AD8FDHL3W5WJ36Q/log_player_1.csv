{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe holds a lot of value. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

This offer starts high, recognizing that you have a backup buyer.  It gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $12000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's a chance you can do better.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $12,000 is a bit too low for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? I'm confident you'll find this to be a great value."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer is $13,000, which is more than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and closer to your ideal price than John's offer.  It's a good deal, so you should accept it."
