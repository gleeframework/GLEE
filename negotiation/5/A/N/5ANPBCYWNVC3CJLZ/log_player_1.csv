Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a bit lower than your minimum desired price, allowing for some flexibility if Bob counters.  This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $100 for it. Would you be able to accommodate this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum desired price of $120. It's also too close to Bob's perceived value, leaving little room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to send a counteroffer and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to go down to $110, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $110 is a reasonable compromise, still above Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value.
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes the finality of the offer, encouraging Bob to make a decision. It also reiterates the value of the product to encourage him to accept.
* **Strategic Aim:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, giving Bob the opportunity to accept while still securing a profit above my minimum desired price."
