"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  Beginning with a strong offer at $2,250,000  leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""immense potential"" and ""significant returns"" to justify the high price, aiming to frame Bob's thinking.
* **Anchoring:** This initial high price acts as an anchor. Even if Bob rejects it, his counteroffers are likely to be higher than if you started lower.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm interested in exploring other options. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's crucial not to settle too quickly.  There's still room for negotiation, and you have ample rounds remaining. Rejecting this offer signals that you see the product's value as higher than his initial bid, potentially pushing him closer to your desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the potential this product holds.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and the return on investment you can expect."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Coming down by $250,000 demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on a price significantly above your minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message continues to emphasize the product's ""true value"" and ""return on investment,"" subtly anchoring these concepts to the higher price point. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer tests Bob's flexibility and provides insight into how much he's willing to budge from his initial stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now significantly closer to your starting point, indicating progress. While $1,700,000 is a tempting offer, you're still in a strong position.  Rejecting this offer maintains pressure and leaves room for further negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer and recognizes the value you see in the product."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Proposing $1,850,000 splits the difference between your last offer and Bob's counteroffer, a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties and signal a desire to close the deal. 
* **Highlighting Compromise:** The message emphasizes that this price is a ""significant compromise"" on your end, subtly reminding Bob of your earlier concessions. 
* **Continuing Momentum:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and encourages Bob to respond in kind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,700,000 again. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob repeating his previous offer suggests he might be reaching his upper limit. By rejecting it again, you signal that you're serious about getting a higher price and are not going to simply settle for his preferred number. It's a calculated risk, but with several rounds remaining and a good alternative option with John, you're in a strong position to hold firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be upfront â€“  $1,700,000 simply isn't feasible for me given the value this product represents. I'm open to finding a solution, but I need you to meet me closer to my previous offer. Would you be willing to consider $1,800,000? This is a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my willingness to close this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This message strikes a balance between standing firm on your valuation and showing flexibility. You're clearly indicating that $1,700,000 is unacceptable while still offering a small concession.
* **Transparency and Urgency:**  Being upfront about your position (""not feasible for me"") adds a sense of urgency and seriousness to the negotiation. 
* **Final Push?:**  This counteroffer could be interpreted as your near-final offer, prompting Bob to either accept a price above his initial target or walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm afraid $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to reiterate my previous counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It seems clear that Bob is unwilling to go higher.  While holding out for a potentially slightly better deal in the next two rounds is tempting, the difference is now relatively small. Accepting $1,700,000 secures a substantial profit above your minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away completely."
