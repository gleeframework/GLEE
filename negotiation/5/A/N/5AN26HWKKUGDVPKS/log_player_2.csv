"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $100. It's a steal at this price, considering it's worth at least $120 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still quite high. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than Alice's initial price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message is polite and expresses interest in the product. I also imply that I'm willing to negotiate further. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My ultimate goal is to buy the product for a price closer to my $80 limit. By starting low, I'm hoping to steer the negotiation in that direction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my acceptable price, but I'm still willing to negotiate a bit further. There's a chance I can get the product for a price closer to $80 if I play it right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $75, I'm splitting the difference between Alice's current offer ($85) and my previous offer ($60). This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win, suggesting that $75 is a fair price for both parties involved. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. I want to try and reach an agreement quickly, as I can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $75 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my price limit. There's no point in negotiating further or buying from John, as both options will cost me $80."
