"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $75 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",80.0,Alice,5,
