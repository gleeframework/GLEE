Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I am still aiming to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant gain. Continuing to push for a higher price with Bob risks him walking away, which would mean losing out on a substantial sum. It's a good business decision to accept the $1,400,000 and secure a profitable deal."
