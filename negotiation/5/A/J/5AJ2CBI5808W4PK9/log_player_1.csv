Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the true worth of what you'll be receiving."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 (Bob's value) as possible, but leave some room for negotiation and ensure Bob sees a benefit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John provides a safety net ($10,000), Alice can confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 gives Bob a $500 discount (making it attractive) while netting Alice a $1,500 profit over her minimum."
