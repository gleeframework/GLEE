I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to capitalize on his potential interest.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to $16,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still trying to get a good deal.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."

Bob's offer is only $500 less than my minimum price, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a better deal in future rounds. I'm accepting his offer and selling the product to Bob."
