Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $1,500,000, so I won't accept anything lower.
* **Bob's maximum:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he won't go higher than that.
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves a potential negotiation range of $300,000.
* **Initial offer:** I'm starting high at $1,750,000, aiming for a good starting point and leaving room for negotiation. 
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage. If Bob rejects my offer, I have a solid fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested in the product. This leaves room for me to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **John as backup:**  I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if I'm unable to negotiate a better price with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have a chance to secure a higher price without immediately settling for his low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  I still value the product at $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so we need to meet somewhere in between.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer of $1,600,000 is a compromise, halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation Room:** By offering this price, I'm still leaving room for potential negotiation.

This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise while maintaining a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired $1,500,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Negotiating further with Bob could lead to more back and forth, potentially ending in a lower price than John's offer. 
* **Guarantee of $1,500,000:** John's offer provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. There's no risk of getting a lower price with further negotiation.

Since John's offer meets my minimum requirements and eliminates the risk of further negotiation, it's the most prudent choice to secure the sale at my desired price."
