Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You absolutely need to make $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John.

**The Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage.  You can use this to aim for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but there's a risk he'll reject it.

**The Offer**

Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value, I'm offering it at a special price of $12,500. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  Starting high shows you value the product.
* **Justification:** Using phrases like ""unique value"" and ""special price"" adds perceived value.
* **Slight Markup:** The $500 markup from your minimum provides a small buffer for negotiation or a pleasant surprise if accepted outright. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (but never below $12,000). 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive opening might be better.

**Outcome**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, you make a profit above your guarantee.
* **Rejection:**  You sell to John at your minimum, ensuring you don't lose out."
