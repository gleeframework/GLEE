"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at $200. It's a fantastic deal, what do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $80. Let's see if we can work something out.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a steal for this product!",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still outside my budget. Let's try $100. It's a fair compromise, and I'm really hoping to get this product.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to get a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $120? This is my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $120 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my absolute maximum. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to buy from John.",110.0,Bob,6,
