"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?"",

This counter-offer attempts to establish a lower price point while still leaving room for negotiation. It's important to be polite and express continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $85. This still allows us to share the value of the product while ensuring a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer, but there's still room for negotiation.  We'll reject this offer and propose something slightly better in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. How about $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

We're nudging the price closer to our target while acknowledging Alice's movement on the price. This strategy aims to find a mutually agreeable point within our budget."
