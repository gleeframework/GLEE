"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth discussing how we can make this transaction beneficial for both parties. Considering the product's worth and the benefits it brings, I propose an initial offer of $16,000. This price reflects not only the product's value but also includes some added perks such as a comprehensive warranty and personalized support. Let me know what you think, and we can discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are only willing to spend $15,000, and Alice is asking for $16,000.
* **Rejecting the offer is the best strategy.** This allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.
* **Buying from John is not yet the best option.** You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the warranty and support, but I'm only able to spend $15,000 at this time.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
