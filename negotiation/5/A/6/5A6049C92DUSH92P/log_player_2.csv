"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's within your budget, you want to save as much money as possible.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's a clear gap between Alice's value ($12,000) and your maximum value ($15,000).  
* **Time to counter:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  A counteroffer of $13,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Middle Ground:** This offer is closer to Alice's value of $12,000, making it more likely she'll accept it.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** It's better to start with a strong counteroffer and potentially negotiate down further than to start low and risk Alice rejecting multiple offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reasonable Offer:**  Alice's offer of $13,500 is now within a reasonable range for both parties. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to your counteroffer.
* **Time and Risk:** With 7 rounds remaining, there's still a chance to negotiate further. However, the risk of Alice rejecting more offers or the negotiation dragging on increases.
* **Value vs. Risk:** While you might get a slightly better price with more negotiation, the potential time and risk of a failed deal make accepting this offer a more sensible choice."
