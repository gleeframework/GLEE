"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $7,000 for the product. What do you think?",7000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $7,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $6,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $6,800 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",6800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $6,800 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. I'm offering $6,600, which is a fair compromise and closer to my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",6600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,600 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $6,750 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",6750.0,Alice,5,
