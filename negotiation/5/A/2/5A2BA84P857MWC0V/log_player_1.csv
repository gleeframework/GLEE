"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get as much as possible.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I'm leaving some room for negotiation. It's also important to remember that I have a backup offer of $1,500,000 from John, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired value through further negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $1,500,000, so I have a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe this counteroffer is fair and reflects the product's value to me.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling and will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my lower limit, I'm still not satisfied. I have a better offer from John, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'm going to make another counteroffer and see if I can get him closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum value.  I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally see my point of view.  If he doesn't, I'm happy to sell to John for $1,500,000."
