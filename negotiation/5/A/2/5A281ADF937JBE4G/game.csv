"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $9,000 to be comfortable. Can we discuss a price of $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $7,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make $8,500. Let's try $8,000, which is my minimum price. Can we agree on that?",8000.0,Alice,5,
