"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $135. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Let's try $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $128 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $129. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll really benefit from having this product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",129.0,Alice,7,
