"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially reach a price that's closer to my minimum value of $10,000.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. While I'm open to negotiating, I need to ensure I get a price that's closer to what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. This shows flexibility while still trying to get a price that's closer to what I want. I'm hoping this compromise will lead to a deal in the next round."
