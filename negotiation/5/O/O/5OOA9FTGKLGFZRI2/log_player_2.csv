"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your budget.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $750000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825000. This is a compromise that I think is still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to your budget, it's still higher than your target of $800,000. You can likely push for a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the value I see in the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $800000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $815000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $815,000 is still above your target of $800,000. You've already made several counteroffers and Alice is showing a reluctance to drop her price further.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $800,000, it's the most prudent decision to go with that option to ensure a deal within your budget."
