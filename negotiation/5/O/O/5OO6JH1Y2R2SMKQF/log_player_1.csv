Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $170 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Fallback Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob."
