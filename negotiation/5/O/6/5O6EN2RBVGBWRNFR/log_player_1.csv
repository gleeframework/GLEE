Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think it's a great deal and you'll be very happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could yield a better return. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob finds $149 a tad high, there's a chance he might counter-offer, giving you room to negotiate down to a price still above $150.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at exactly John's price might make Bob think it's worth less. A slightly higher price suggests higher value."
