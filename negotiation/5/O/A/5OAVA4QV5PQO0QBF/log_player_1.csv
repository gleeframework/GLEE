``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay.  I also want to emphasize the ""potential value"" of the product to make him think about the long-term benefits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I want to explore his maximum willingness to pay before resorting to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. Given the potential value of this product, I believe $1,350,000 is a more reasonable price. It's still a significant discount from my initial offer and offers you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counter-offering with a slightly lower price, but still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility without sacrificing too much. I also reiterate the ""potential value"" to remind him of the long-term benefits, making the price seem more justifiable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to squeeze out a little more. I want to see if I can get him to budge further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. How about $1,300,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's potential and the value you'll gain from it.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm continuing to negotiate by offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still a little higher. I'm emphasizing the potential value and the importance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to pay $1225000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I'm still not convinced I can't get a better price.  It's possible that Bob might be willing to go higher to secure the deal, and I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your number, but I'm still a bit off. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's reach a deal before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

I'm trying to push for a slightly higher price, but acknowledging Bob's stubbornness. I'm framing the offer as a compromise, making it seem more appealing. Also, I'm introducing a sense of urgency by reminding him that we are running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1220000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time. While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, I'm worried that Bob might not budge further.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is a good outcome considering my minimum target.  I'm taking the safe option to avoid potentially losing out entirely."
