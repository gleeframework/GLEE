Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. My counteroffer is $1,400,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value in the product, I still feel that we might be able to find common ground. My counteroffer is $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is the most strategically sound option at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  $1,600,000 is a significant profit margin over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away, and John's offer acts as a reliable fallback if needed. 
* **Time Value:**  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Securing a deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties associated with further negotiation rounds."
