Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a price closer to $12,000. How about $10,500?  I think this is a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
