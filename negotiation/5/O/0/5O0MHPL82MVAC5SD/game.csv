"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you presenting this product. However, $2000000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. This is a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1800000 is still beyond my budget. Given the unique nature of this product, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1400000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits. Let's try to close the deal at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1600000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm trying to find a middle ground. I'm open to further negotiation, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this. While $1600000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1500000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget.  I believe this price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair transaction. I'm hoping you'll consider accepting it.",1500000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you've made a final offer, but I'm not willing to accept $1500000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1700000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1700000.0,Alice,7,
