"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and signals my willingness to compromise. 
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly tone helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Briefly mentioning the product's potential usefulness for Bob can further incentivize him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Out:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell at a loss. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially reach a price closer to my target.
* **Exploring Options:** I'm not ready to sell to John yet as there's still room for improvement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is a good offer, I'm looking for a bit more. How about $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Strong Justification:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price point.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  Using the word ""fair"" implies a balanced deal, making it more appealing to Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $108. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** While $108 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. 
* **Potential for Higher:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, especially since he expressed interest in the product.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet as there's still a chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiterating Compromise:**  I'm offering the same price as my previous round to show consistency and my desire to reach an agreement.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing how the price is good for ""both of us"" to build a sense of cooperation and encourage acceptance.
* **Direct and Concise:** I'm keeping the message concise and focused on the price, avoiding further negotiation tactics for now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'd be willing to go up to $107. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're halfway through the rounds, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly close to his initial value.
* **Limited Potential:** There's not much room left for further negotiation, and I'm not confident he'll go much higher. 
* **Secure Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $120, which is a safe and profitable choice at this point."
