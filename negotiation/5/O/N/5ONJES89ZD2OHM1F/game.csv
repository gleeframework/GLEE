"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. It's a unique item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and allows us both to make a decent profit.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows for both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not sure $1,000,000 is enough for me to walk away with a good deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the $1,200,000 I initially offered. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
