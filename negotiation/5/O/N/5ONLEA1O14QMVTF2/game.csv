"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you consider a price closer to that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've invested in it.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1000000. Could you consider a price of $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can do $1150000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe the product's value is worth more, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1125000. Can you consider this price?",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I can do $1200000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're willing to make one more concession, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1150000. Can you consider this price?",1150000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting stuck. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000, and I'm starting to think that's the minimum I should get for this product. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1200000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand you're willing to make one final offer, Alice. However, I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and explore other options. I appreciate your time and effort, but I'm not willing to pay $1200000. I'll have to look elsewhere.",0.0,Bob,10,
