"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for improvement.  Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so it's worth pushing for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows for another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and your original offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and the gap is now relatively small.
* **Value vs. Risk:** While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or the deal falling apart increases with each round. At this point, $11,250 is a good deal for Bob, saving him a significant amount compared to John's price.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product and avoids potentially losing out to John or Alice deciding to stop the negotiation."
