"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm on a bit of a budget. Could we possibly settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as high as $9,500. I'm willing to make a slightly higher concession and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
