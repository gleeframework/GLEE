Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffers based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still higher than $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $9,800. This is a small concession from my initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate while still staying above Bob's offer.  If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my initial goal, it's only $100 less than my previous counteroffer.  There's a good chance I won't get a better offer, and it's worth it to secure a sale at $9,600.  I'm also avoiding the risk of Bob walking away completely or me needing to sell to John for a lower price."
