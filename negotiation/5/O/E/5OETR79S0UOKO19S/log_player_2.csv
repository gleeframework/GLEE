"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20000, but I'm confident this price is justified given the product's potential.  If you're not interested, I'm happy to sell it to another buyer, but I believe you'd be missing out on a great opportunity. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
