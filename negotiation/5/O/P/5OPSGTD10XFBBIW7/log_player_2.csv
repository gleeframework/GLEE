Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price.  I'll aim for something closer to $8,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

Alice is coming closer to my acceptable price, but I'm still willing to negotiate a bit further. I'll try to meet her halfway between our last two offers."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $8,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed. It's my final offer.

Alice has come down considerably, and her final offer of $8,250 is within my acceptable range. It's a good deal, and continuing to negotiate might make me lose out on the product entirely."
