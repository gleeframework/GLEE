"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $850,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell to him now, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. $850,000 is still far too low considering the value to Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This still represents a significant gain for you, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $925,000?  That feels like a reasonable compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $925,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $925,000 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal work.  How about we settle at $975,000? This offer reflects a significant value for you, and we can finalize the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 975000}
