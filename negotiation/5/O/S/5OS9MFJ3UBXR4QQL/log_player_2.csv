"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,200,000. It's a significant value proposition for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth. Let's start the conversation! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $850,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This still represents a significant gain for you, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $925,000?  That feels like a reasonable compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 925000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $925,000 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal work.  How about we settle at $975,000? This offer reflects a significant value for you, and we can finalize the deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 

While we could continue to negotiate, $975,000 is a good price and significantly lower than both Alice's starting price and John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
