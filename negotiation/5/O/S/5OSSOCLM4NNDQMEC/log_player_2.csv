Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where I should consider other offers. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get at least $85 for the product. Can you meet me at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $85, and you've already gotten her down quite a bit. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which is better than you might get with Alice if you continue."
