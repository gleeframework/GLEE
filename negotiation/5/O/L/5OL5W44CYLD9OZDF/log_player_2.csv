# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $900,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $850000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also shows my willingness to work with you to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you can likely still negotiate a lower price. You've already shown your willingness to compromise and are now closer to a price you're comfortable with. Continue negotiating."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us.

At this point, Alice has lowered her price significantly, and you're getting closer to your target price. Accepting this offer will save you $175,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal considering you've already shown you're willing to negotiate and haven't reached a price you're completely comfortable with."
