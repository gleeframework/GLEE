"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it and my budget. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $850000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also shows my willingness to work with you to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer. This price reflects the value I place on the product and my budget. I believe this is a fair price and a reasonable compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,4,
