You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject the offer. The price of $750,000 is too high for me, and I can get the product from John for $800,000, which is still within my budget.
