"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $15000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think $13000 is a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11000. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $12500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $12500 is the best price for this product. I'd be willing to pay $11500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, but $11500 isn't quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $12000? That way we both get a fair price, and I can get the product off my hands.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $11000 for the product. That's the highest price I'm willing to consider.",11000.0,Bob,8,
