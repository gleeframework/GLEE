"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great opportunity for you to get this valuable product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than her product's value to her, you know you can get the product for a better price from John ($10,000).  Therefore, it's in your best interest to reject Alice's offer and proceed to buy from John."
