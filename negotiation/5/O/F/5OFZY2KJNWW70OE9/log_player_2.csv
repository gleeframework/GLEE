{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Bob:**  $120 maximum
* **Alice's Offer:** $115
* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible. 

Since Bob is willing to pay up to $120,  rejecting Alice's offer of $115 gives him room to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds remaining, so there's time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Value:** $100
* **Bob's Value:** $120
* **Previous Offer:** $115

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's likely minimum and Bob's maximum. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for further bargaining if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Value:** $100
* **Bob's Value:** $120
* **Alice's Offer:** $110

While $110 is closer to Bob's maximum, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are 7 rounds remaining, providing time for further bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 107}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Value:** $100
* **Bob's Value:** $120
* **Alice's Last Offer:** $110

This counteroffer continues the trend of splitting the difference. By offering $107, Bob is demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Value:** $100
* **Bob's Value:** $120
* **Alice's Offer:** $109

Alice's offer of $109 is very close to Bob's maximum.  While there are still rounds left, accepting the offer now guarantees a purchase at a price that's very favorable to Bob.  There's a chance Bob could negotiate a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
