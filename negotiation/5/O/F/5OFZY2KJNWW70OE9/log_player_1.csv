Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a price closer to my target."
