Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still ensures I get a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000).
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message aims to convey confidence in the product's value while avoiding an overly aggressive starting price that might scare Bob away.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of securing a higher price than my fallback option with John."
