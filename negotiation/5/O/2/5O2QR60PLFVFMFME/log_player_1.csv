Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you!  I'm asking $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm framing it as a positive interaction with a potential benefit to Bob. 
* **Strategy:** By starting high, I create room to negotiate downward while still maximizing my potential profit.  If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffers accordingly. If necessary, I can always fall back on John's $15,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $5,000 is simply not acceptable.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower to see if we can find some common ground. Selling to John at this point would be the best outcome, but I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you letting me know your price point.  While $5,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've reduced my price by $3,000, which shows flexibility but still keeps me well above Bob's offer. 
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate and  suggesting that $9,000 is a fair compromise.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer is designed to test Bob's seriousness about purchasing the product.  If he rejects again, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I believe I can still do better with Bob or John. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, showing I'm open to negotiation but still wanting to secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $7,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference at $8,500?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's, showing willingness to compromise further. 
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the 'fairness' of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage a deal.
* **Strategy:**  This is a final attempt to get a decent price from Bob. If he rejects, I'll sell to John and end the negotiation."
