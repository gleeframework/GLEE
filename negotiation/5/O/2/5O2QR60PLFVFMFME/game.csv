"Bob, I appreciate you letting me know your price point.  While $5,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $7,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference at $8,500?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
