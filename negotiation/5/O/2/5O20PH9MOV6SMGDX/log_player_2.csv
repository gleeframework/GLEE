"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  You value the product at $1,200,000, so you have some wiggle room to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the price down a bit. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. Considering our initial offer of $950,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your desire for a better price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I want to secure the product for a price closer to my counteroffer of $850,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter again and potentially reach a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $875,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $915,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While I'd still prefer a lower price,  $915,000 is a significant savings compared to buying from John for $1,200,000. It's a good compromise and allows me to secure the product at a price that is within my budget."
