Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. Although it's my minimum price, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $140?  I believe this still represents a good value for you."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about $140. Would you be willing to go as low as $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $130. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and closer to what I originally wanted.  It's better than selling to John for $120."
