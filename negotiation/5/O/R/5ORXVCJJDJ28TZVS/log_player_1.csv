"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your expertise. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong opening offer, aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value but significantly above our minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob (""immense value,"" ""your expertise"") helps justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is collaborative (""proposing,"" ""your thoughts"") signaling our willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is above our absolute minimum but still significantly lower than both our opening offer and his perceived value. Rejecting this offer shows we're serious about negotiating a better deal while keeping the option open for Bob to make a more competitive counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the value this product brings to your specific operations justifies a higher investment. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Concede:** We recognize Bob's counteroffer and acknowledge his perspective (""understand your perspective"") to maintain a positive negotiation environment. We also show willingness to compromise by slightly lowering our price.
* **Reiterate Value:** We emphasize the product's unique value to Bob's business (""your specific operations"") to justify the higher price tag. 
* **Strong but Flexible:** We stand firm on a price point significantly above Bob's offer, demonstrating our position, but leave room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we agree on $925,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value it brings to my operations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a desirable range, we're still in a position to negotiate further. He's acknowledging the product's value to his operations, indicating potential for a higher final price. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on and encourages him to move closer to our desired range. We are still significantly above John's offer, so there is room to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers your business, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $975,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while ensuring a fair return on a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Building Rapport:** We acknowledge Bob's understanding of the product's value and commend his negotiation style to foster a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Strategic Concession:** We're moving closer to the middle ground, signaling our willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above $950,000.
* **Justification:** We emphasize that this price reflects both our desire to close the deal and the inherent value of the product. This anchors the price to objective worth rather than just negotiation tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you finding a middle ground.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable. Would you consider $950,000? That would work well for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant profit above our minimum ($800,000) and a good outcome for our negotiation.
* **Potential Risks:**  Continuing to push for a slightly higher price could risk Bob walking away or becoming less willing to negotiate. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now secures a great price and avoids the uncertainty of further rounds.  It's unlikely we'll get Bob much higher than this, and the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for slightly more profit."
