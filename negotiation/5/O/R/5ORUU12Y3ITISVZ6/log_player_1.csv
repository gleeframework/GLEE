Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $95 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation and acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product.  

Let me know if you'd like me to continue the negotiation based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price of $95.  Would you be willing to go up to $90? It's a fair compromise that values both of our positions."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. How about we meet at $87.50? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  $87.5 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it."
