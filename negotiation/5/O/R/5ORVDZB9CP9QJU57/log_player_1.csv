{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that's still attractive to Bob while leaving room for potential counteroffers.  I'm starting high to maximize my potential profit, but I'm also prepared to go lower if needed to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal by counteroffering. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so there is room to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest! $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $8750?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to buy the product right away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, it's a good deal for both of us and it avoids the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the sale."
