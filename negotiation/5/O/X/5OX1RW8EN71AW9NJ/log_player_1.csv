Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the premium quality of your product, Alice. However, $14000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $12500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase it if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
