"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,300,000. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,400,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This is a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but my maximum budget remains at $1,500,000.  Perhaps we could meet somewhere in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I value finding common ground. How about we settle at $1,900,000? This is my final offer.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,900,000 is still exceeding my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering we're both aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
