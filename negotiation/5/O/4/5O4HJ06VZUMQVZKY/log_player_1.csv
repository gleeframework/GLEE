Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting in the middle. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Offering $11,500 ensures a significant profit for Alice, even if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 

This approach aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while ensuring Alice doesn't undervalue the product."
