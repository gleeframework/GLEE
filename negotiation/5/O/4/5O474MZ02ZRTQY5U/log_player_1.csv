Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $13,000. This is a good starting point because it's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's only $500 more than what he's willing to pay. It's also closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I could continue negotiating, I'm not sure I'll be able to get much closer to my desired price.  Selling to John guarantees me $12,000, which is a safe and reasonable outcome."
