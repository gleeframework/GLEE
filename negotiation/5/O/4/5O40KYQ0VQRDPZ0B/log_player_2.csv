You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $1,500,000, which is above my budget. I will reject her offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000.
