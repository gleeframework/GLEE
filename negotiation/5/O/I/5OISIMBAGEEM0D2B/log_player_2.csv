"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, which I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000, a price that I think is a great compromise considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $10,000. There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice, especially since her product is only worth $8,000 to her. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a more competitive price."
