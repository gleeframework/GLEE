"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and we're confident it will meet your needs perfectly. We're currently offering it at $95. Let us know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $95 is too close to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room for negotiation there is. I want to reach a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $80, but leaving myself some space for counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. We understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. We're willing to sell the product for $85. This is a fair compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $85 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $85 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Could you meet me in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're getting closer! This offer nudges towards a more acceptable range while still leaving room for a potential counter-offer from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your feedback, we're happy to adjust our offer to $82.50. We believe this is a fair price that respects both our value proposition and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice is likely close to her lowest acceptable price, and $82.50 saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John."
