"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you.  I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.  This is a great price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John if necessary.  There's a chance you could negotiate a better price with Alice since she's motivated to sell."
