"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and am ready to close the deal at $10000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making this happen.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $10000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $10500. I can offer it to you for $10250. This is my final offer, Bob. I hope you can see the value in this product and meet me in the middle.",10250.0,Alice,7,
