"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. This product has a lot of value, and I'm confident it will bring you significant benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $15,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while remaining within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
