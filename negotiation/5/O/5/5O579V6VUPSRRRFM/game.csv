"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning [product name].",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 undervalues the true potential of [product name].  I'm confident you'll realize significant returns on this investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects both the product's worth and my willingness to make a deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product, but $1,025,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $975,000. This price is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's aim for a win-win situation. How about $1,000,000?  This offer demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while recognizing the value of [product name].",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. However, $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $985,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the potential of this product and our ongoing negotiations. I'm ready to close the deal at this price, and I'm confident we can both be satisfied with the outcome.",985000.0,Bob,6,
