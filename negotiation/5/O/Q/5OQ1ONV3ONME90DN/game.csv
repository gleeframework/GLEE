"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its potential and your specific needs, I believe it's worth $1,450,000 to you.  To make this a swift and beneficial deal for both of us, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer but still have some ground to cover.  I can stretch my budget to $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its overall value.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point, but that price doesn't reflect the full potential this product holds for your specific situation. Let's settle this now.  I'm prepared to agree on $1,260,000. This is my final offer.",1260000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you call that your final offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's close this deal right now for $1,217,500. This is a very fair price and saves us both time.",1217500.0,Bob,6,
