Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I acknowledge the value you place on the product, $950,000 falls short of what it's worth.  Let's find a middle ground.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This offer is very close to my minimum. I'm going to accept it, as it's a good deal considering I only have 6 rounds left. There's always a risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price."
