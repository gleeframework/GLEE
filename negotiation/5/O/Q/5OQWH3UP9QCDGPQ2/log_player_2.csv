"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. He has a higher value for the product ($15,000) and can use that to his advantage in negotiations.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to Alice's value. By offering $10,000, he shows he's serious about buying but wants a better deal. This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation while still being within his desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further,  how about $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us,  considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  He can save $4,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and him having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings. Accepting the offer is the most rational decision."
