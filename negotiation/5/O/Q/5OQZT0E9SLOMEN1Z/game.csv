"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I agree it's a good product, $850,000 is still a bit much. How about we split the difference again and settle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
