"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. I believe it's worth more than what you're willing to pay, but I respect your valuation. Given the intrinsic value and quality of the product, I propose selling it to you for $95. This price reflects the cost of acquiring the item and my desire to ensure a fair transaction. I trust this offer will be acceptable to you.",95.0,Alice,1,
