"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. I believe it's worth more than what you're willing to pay, but I respect your valuation. Given the intrinsic value and quality of the product, I propose selling it to you for $95. This price reflects the cost of acquiring the item and my desire to ensure a fair transaction. I trust this offer will be acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no need to pay $95."
