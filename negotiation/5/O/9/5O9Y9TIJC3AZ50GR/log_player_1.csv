Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price possible, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,325,000. Would you be willing to go down to $1,325,000 or is that still too low for you?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Even though it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still some room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can push for a price closer to $1,350,000 before considering his offer."

Round 8

With Bob's latest offer, it's becoming clear that we're not going to get any closer to my desired price point.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  I'm not happy about having to settle, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
