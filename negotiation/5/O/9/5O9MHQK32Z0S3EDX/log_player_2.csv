"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round. I think the product is overpriced at $1,000,000, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is a good one, but I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.

{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $750000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000, and I'm not sure if I want to spend more than that. I'd like to make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to pay $900,000. I'm willing to meet Alice halfway, but I'm not going to go above $850,000.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $850,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
