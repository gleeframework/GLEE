Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is a good price, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired value. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $850000. I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $850,000 is a good price, and I'm happy to close the deal.  It's closer to my desired value than John's offer, and I'm confident that I can find other opportunities to make up any difference."
