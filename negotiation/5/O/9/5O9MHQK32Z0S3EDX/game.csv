"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $750000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $850000. I believe that's a fair price for the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
