You can do better than $90, as the product is worth $80 to Alice.  You should try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

You're trying to get a good deal, but you don't want to lose the opportunity completely. $85 is a fair compromise, given that the product is worth $80 to Alice."

Alice is trying to push the price up. You can still do better than $95. It's worth trying one more counteroffer."

You're willing to meet Alice halfway, but you won't go higher than $90.  This shows you're serious about getting a deal, but also that you're not afraid to walk away."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your limit, but $97 is still too high.  You're better off buying from John at $120. It's not the ideal price, but it's still within your budget, and you'll avoid further negotiations."
