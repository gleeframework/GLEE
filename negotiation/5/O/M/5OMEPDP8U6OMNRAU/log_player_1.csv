Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I think the product is interesting, but I'm not willing to pay $160. I'm looking for something more reasonable. I'd be willing to pay $120 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Explanation:

Bob offered $120, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I can sell the product to John for the same price without further negotiation. Therefore, it makes more sense to sell to John and avoid the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
