"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10200. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $9750. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9750 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think I should just buy the product from John for $10000. I'm not willing to pay $10500. I'll make one last counteroffer: $9500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you really walk away from a sale at this point?",9500.0,Bob,6,
