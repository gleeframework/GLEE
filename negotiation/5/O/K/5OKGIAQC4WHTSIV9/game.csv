"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair price that's closer to your value and still allows me to make a decent profit.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $92.50 is still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $88.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",88.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $88.50 is simply too low for me. How about we compromise at $90.50? It's a fair price that gives you a good discount while still allowing me to get closer to my desired amount.",90.5,Alice,5,
