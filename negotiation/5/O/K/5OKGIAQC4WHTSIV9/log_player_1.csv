{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm willing to let it go for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but below your minimum acceptable price, giving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair price that's closer to your value and still allows me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $92.50 is still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $88.50?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $88.50 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially since I have John as a backup buyer.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $88.50 is simply too low for me. How about we compromise at $90.50? It's a fair price that gives you a good discount while still allowing me to get closer to my desired amount."", ""product_price"": 90.5}
