"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $14,000.  This suggests there's room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend $13,000, but I'm not quite willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $14,200. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but $14,200 is still too high. It's worth seeing if you can get her lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're still looking to spend $13,500, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I can offer you a slight adjustment at $14,500. This is as close to your target as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now offering $14,500, which is closer to your ideal price, but still higher than your counter-offer of $13,500.  Since you're close to your maximum price point of $15,000, it's probably best to buy from John at that price.  There's a good chance further negotiations with Alice won't get you significantly lower."
