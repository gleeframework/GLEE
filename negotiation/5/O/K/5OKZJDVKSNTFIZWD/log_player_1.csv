Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's still a good starting point given my minimum value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$120 is better than selling to John, but I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully it will be enough to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is a good compromise. While I'd ideally like more, it's above my minimum and better than selling to John. I'll accept it."
