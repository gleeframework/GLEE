,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a good middle ground that allows us both to make a profitable deal. Let's see if we can close this out.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting close, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $890,000 for the product. This is a serious offer that I believe is fair and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",890000.0,Bob,6,
