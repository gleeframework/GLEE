While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to accept $920,000 yet. I believe we can still negotiate a lower price. The risk of buying from John is still present, but I want to exhaust my options with Alice first."

While $910,000 is still above my target, it's a reasonable price compared to what John would charge.  It's time to accept and close this deal."
