Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $140 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly downward.
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  It's crucial that our offer to Bob is significantly higher than John's $120 offer. This ensures we prioritize selling to Bob, who values the product more."
