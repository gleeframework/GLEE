"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering the value it brings.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging to build rapport. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to incentivize him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers up to $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I'm not ready to sell to John yet because there's a chance I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is more in line with my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but not by too much. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for continued discussion, but I'm staying firm on a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I must respectfully decline. My maximum budget remains at $1,200,000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge from his price.  
* **Time Running Out:** We're already in round 4, leaving only 6 rounds left.  There's a risk that further negotiation will only waste time.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer is guaranteed and offers a much better price than Bob's offer.  
* **Minimizing Loss:** Selling to John minimizes the risk of ending up with a much lower price if we continue negotiating with Bob.  While it's not my ideal price, it's the most secure option at this point."
