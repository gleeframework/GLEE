Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
