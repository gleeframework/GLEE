"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm starting with a strong offer. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $700,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a reasonable compromise. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice is at her lowest price, which is still a significant savings compared to John's offer."
