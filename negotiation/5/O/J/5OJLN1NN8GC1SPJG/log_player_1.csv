Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me.  I could do $10,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is still a bit too steep for me though. How about $11,000?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price for this product. $11,000 is cutting it too close.  Would you consider $11,750?"", ""product_price"": 11750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I can go up a bit.  Would you consider $11,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is clearly anchored at $10,000 and incrementing very slowly. While he might eventually go above $11,200, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that significantly surpasses John's offer of $12,000 within the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut losses and take the guaranteed profit with John."
