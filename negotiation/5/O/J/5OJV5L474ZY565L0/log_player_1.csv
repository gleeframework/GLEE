Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find immense value in. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the return on investment you'll likely see."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), it's always beneficial to try and negotiate a higher price. 
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering a price significantly closer to Bob's perceived value ($800,000) might be seen as insulting and could deter him.  A price closer to my own valuation, but still leaving room for profit for Bob, is more likely to be taken seriously.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique features"" and ""potential return on investment,"" I'm framing the offer in a way that emphasizes value to Bob, potentially justifying the high price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a higher profit margin and the risk of him rejecting the offer."
