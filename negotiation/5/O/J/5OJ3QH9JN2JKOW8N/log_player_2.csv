{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very close to her minimum price and has consistently moved towards your offers. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll hold firm at $10,000. Accepting at $10,050 secures a good price for you and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
