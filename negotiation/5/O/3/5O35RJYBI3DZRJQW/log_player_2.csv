"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This price represents a significant discount from its true value to me, as I would be able to easily sell it to another buyer for $1,200,000. However, I believe in the potential of our partnership and hope you'll consider this offer. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
