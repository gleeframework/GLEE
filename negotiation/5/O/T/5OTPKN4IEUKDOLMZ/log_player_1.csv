{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. I also want to sound enthusiastic and build a rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell it for that low of a price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this amazing product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not happy with the price, but $95 is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept. I'll see if I can get Bob to go up a little bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $95 is still a little low for me. Let's try $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and you'll be getting a great product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
