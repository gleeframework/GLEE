,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $105? It's a fair price, and I know you'll love this product!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure if $105 is the best price for me. Can you meet me at $95? I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was really thinking more along the lines of $92. It's a great product, but I've got some other expenses to consider.",92.0,Bob,6,
