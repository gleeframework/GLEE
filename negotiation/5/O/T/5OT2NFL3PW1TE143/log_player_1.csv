Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. While I could sell to John for $100, I believe I can get a better price from Bob if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $105? It's a fair price, and I know you'll love this product!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure if $105 is the best price for me. Can you meet me at $95? I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $100. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was really thinking more along the lines of $92. It's a great product, but I've got some other expenses to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm running out of rounds. It's better to guarantee the sale now and avoid the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer."
