"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings and the potential for future collaborations.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer of $750,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $675,000. This shows my commitment to the deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $675,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $725,000. This is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $725,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to go up to $690,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of this product. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round. What do you think?",690000.0,Bob,6,

I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $715,000. This is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",715000.0,Alice,7,
