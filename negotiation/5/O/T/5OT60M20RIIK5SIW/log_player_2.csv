# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if I can get a lower price.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, and I have 10 rounds to work with."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $725,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to go up to $690,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

This is Alice's final offer, and it's higher than my target price. While I've already saved $75,000 from the initial price, I'm down to my last round. To avoid risking losing the deal entirely, I'm going to buy from John. The $800,000 price is still a better deal than accepting Alice's final offer."
