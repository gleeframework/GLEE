Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand the value of this product, $1,900,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, my absolute lowest price for this product is $1,500,000.  I'm firm on this price, but I believe it's a fair deal considering the value it brings.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and we're already at round 5.  It's getting risky to keep going, as we're running out of time.  To ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll go with John's offer."
