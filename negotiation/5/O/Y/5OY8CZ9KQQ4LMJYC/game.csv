"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate it.  However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I appreciate that.  However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm ready to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $9,500?  That seems like a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,000, which is my absolute minimum. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,5,
