"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $11500. This is a great deal, considering the value the product will bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the value of the product, but $11,500 is unfortunately a bit above my budget.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $11000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is getting closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll counteroffer at $10800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his ideal price of $10,000. While Alice's offer is tempting, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer keeps the option open to potentially get the product for even less, which would be even more beneficial to Bob.  It also shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting the best deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $10,800 is closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $10,600. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $10700. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,700 is only $700 above Bob's ideal price of $10,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering Bob only has 3 rounds left before he needs to buy from John.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $300 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or having to buy at a higher price from John is too high."
