"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the value of the product, but $11500 is unfortunately a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500, which is still a fair price considering the value I'm expecting. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $11000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your life. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $10800 is closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $10600. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal.",10600.0,Bob,6,
