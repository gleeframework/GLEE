"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to sell at that price.  I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10750. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
