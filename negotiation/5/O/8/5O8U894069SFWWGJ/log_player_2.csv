"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high. It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After re-evaluating the market value, I'm willing to consider a price of $875,000 for the product. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your desire for a better deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer guarantees a good deal and saves him $125,000 compared to buying from John."
