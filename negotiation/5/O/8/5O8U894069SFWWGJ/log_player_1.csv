Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
