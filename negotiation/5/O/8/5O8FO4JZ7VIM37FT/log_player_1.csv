"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the negotiations at $2,250,000."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation and anchors the price high in Bob's mind. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This approach aims to understand Bob's willingness to pay and establish a strong bargaining position from the outset. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 provides a safety net and influences your negotiation strategy with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price given my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum. You have room to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to your target. Selling to John at this stage would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, your offer is significantly below what I consider a fair price for this product. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:** Shows willingness to negotiate but maintains a strong stance on the product's value.
* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation while moving closer to a potential agreement.
* **Time Consideration:** With seven rounds remaining, there's still time to explore a mutually beneficial deal before resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $1,950,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This is a substantial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate by increasing his offer significantly. 
* **Potential for More:** While $1,400,000 is getting closer to John's offer, there's still a gap to your minimum. With six rounds left, you can likely secure a better deal. 
* **Strategic Holdout:** Rejecting at this stage maintains pressure on Bob and signals that you value the product above his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate the effort you're making. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,700,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's last offer and your previous counteroffer, signaling fairness and a desire to close the deal.
* **Above John's Offer:** The price remains higher than selling to John, ensuring you're still striving for the best possible outcome.
* **Time Constraint:** With five rounds remaining, this offer encourages Bob to make a decision while leaving room for minor adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I value your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is a very fair price considering my budget and the product's value. This would be a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Offer:** Bob's offer now matches John's standing offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate for a potentially small increase in price isn't worth the risk of losing the sale altogether. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids potential delays associated with further negotiation."
