"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the unique value of this product and its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $875,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit short of my target price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this unique product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,
