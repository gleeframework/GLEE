{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,500,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the offer acceptable. Offering the product for a price between Bob's valuation and your minimum won't work because you'd be losing money (e.g., selling at $1,000,000 earns you less than John's offer).

Therefore, you need to offer a price that's enticing to Bob but still allows you to potentially make more than John's offer.  

Here's why $1,300,000 is a strategic starting point:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** If Bob accepts, you make $1,300,000, which is better than your minimum and potentially better than what you'd get from John depending on your absolute minimum.
* **Negotiating Room:**  This leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can decide if a lower price is acceptable.
* **Alternative Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John's guaranteed purchase at $1,500,000. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while having a strong fallback option."
