"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it doesn't quite reflect the true value I believe this product holds. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price still allows me to secure a fair return while providing you with a significant opportunity. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
