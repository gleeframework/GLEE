"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a great price, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.  There's no harm in seeing if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price.  This is an aggressive move, but it establishes a lower price point and gives Alice room to negotiate while still leaving me a substantial profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but $400,000 is still too high. I believe I can still negotiate a lower price. I'm going to try another counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still believe the price can be lower. It's a compromise that could lead to a successful deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my desired price point, but she's getting closer.  We're both showing willingness to compromise, so I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm now meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer.  This demonstrates a strong commitment to reaching an agreement while still maintaining some leverage. It's highly likely that she will either accept this price or make a counteroffer very close to it, pushing us towards a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price.  While it's still a bit higher than I'd like,  I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, Alice may increase the price again, or I may risk running out of rounds before securing the product.  With only 3 rounds remaining, accepting the offer will save me time and potentially a higher price in the future."
