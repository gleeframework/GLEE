This offer starts at a price point above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to come closer to my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $8,000 is below my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept anything lower than $12,000."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, $8,500 is still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell it for less than $9,000."

Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I would prefer to have closed the deal with Bob,  $8,750 is still below my minimum.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him at this point when I have a guaranteed sale with John at a much more favorable price."
