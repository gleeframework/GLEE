"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9,500. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to pay $9,500. By rejecting the offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice or simply buy it from John for a lower price."
