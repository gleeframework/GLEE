Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price up to $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. I appreciate the effort you're making. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a final offer of $1,125,000. I hope this aligns with your considerations and we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to move much beyond his $1,125,000 offer if he's calling it ""final."" Accepting this offer secures us a profit of $325,000 above our minimum. Further haggling risks pushing Bob away and potentially losing a good deal."
