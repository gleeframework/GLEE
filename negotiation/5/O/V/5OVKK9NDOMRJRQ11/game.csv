"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $950,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground there.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 for this. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
