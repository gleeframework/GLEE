"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to accept $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset and me to receive a decent return on my investment. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price allows you to acquire a valuable asset, while still providing me with a reasonable return. It's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's my absolute maximum. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
