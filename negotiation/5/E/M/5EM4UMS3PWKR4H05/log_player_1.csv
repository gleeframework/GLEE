{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's above your minimum price but not so high that it's immediately rejected. 
* **Highlights the value for Bob:**  Mentioning the product's value to him can make him more inclined to negotiate.

It's important to be prepared to counter Bob's offers if he doesn't accept this initial price."
