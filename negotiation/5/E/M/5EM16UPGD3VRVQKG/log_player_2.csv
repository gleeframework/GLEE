"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. He has 10 rounds and the potential to counteroffer, giving him leverage to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000 for this product.  It's a significant investment for me, and this price point would make it a more attractive acquisition. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the investment.  However, the value this product brings is truly unique and worth a premium. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue to try and secure a lower price, as he has several rounds left.  He can counteroffer again to see if he can get closer to his target of $1,050,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I value this product, $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's work together to close this."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
