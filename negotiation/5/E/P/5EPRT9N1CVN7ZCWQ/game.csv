"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This price still gives you a great deal, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, but I believe we can find a better middle ground. Let me propose $1,150,000 for the product. This still allows me to save some money compared to buying directly from you.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too far off from what I need. Let's aim for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'll consider it carefully. My counteroffer is $1,180,000 for the product. This price still allows me to save money compared to purchasing from another seller.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,180,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Given that we're both trying to reach an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000 for this product. This offer allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal.  This is my final offer, let's close the deal now.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I've given it careful consideration, and I'd like to propose a price of $1,210,000 for the product. This still allows me to save money compared to other options available to me.",1210000.0,Bob,8,
