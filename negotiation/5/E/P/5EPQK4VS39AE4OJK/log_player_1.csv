Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $14,500 is close, but I need to get at least $16,000 for this to make sense. That's already a significant discount from my initial asking price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
