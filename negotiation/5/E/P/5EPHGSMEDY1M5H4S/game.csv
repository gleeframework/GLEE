"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I understand that $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $135. Would that work for you?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me there?",130.0,Alice,5,
