"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both sides.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm confident that we can find a middle ground that benefits both of us. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a solution. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both benefit from this deal.  Let's bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,080,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget. Let's reach a final agreement and close this deal.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
