Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both sides.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's also better than the $1,000,000 I could get from John.  With only four rounds remaining, it's time to secure this deal and maximize my earnings."
