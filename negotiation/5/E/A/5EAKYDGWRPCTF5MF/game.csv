"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $7,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we settle at $6,800? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,800 is still a bit above your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $7,200. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How does $7,000 sound?",7000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm flattered that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $7,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $7,100. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",7100.0,Alice,7,
