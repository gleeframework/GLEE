"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $13,500 for this exceptional item. This price not only ensures a fair return for us but also presents an excellent opportunity for you to maximize your investment with a cost that is still significantly lower than its worth to you. Please let me know if you need more information or have any concerns regarding the product or the offer. I look forward to your positive response.
