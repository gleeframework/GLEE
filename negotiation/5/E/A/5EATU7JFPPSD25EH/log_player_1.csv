Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement you've made so far.  However, the gap between our valuations is still pretty wide.  To be frank, anything above $800,000 is a non-starter for me. I'd be willing to go to $750,000 if that would get us closer to a deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now revealed his likely maximum price ($800,000) but hasn't budged from it. It's time to significantly increase pressure and signal that walking away is a real possibility.  We are still far apart, but there are four rounds left to negotiate a better deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible, but we're running out of room to make this work. I'm aware of other interested buyers, and to be frank, $750,000 is simply too far below its worth. My final offer is $1,400,000.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Signal:** The message clearly states this is a final offer, creating urgency and signaling seriousness about walking away.
* **Justification:**  The message reminds Bob of Alice's flexibility while re-emphasizing the low valuation of his offer.
* **Alternative:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" reminds Bob that Alice has other options.
* **Calculated Risk:** This is a significant drop in price, designed to test if Bob is willing to negotiate closer to Alice's desired range. However, it leaves room to accept John's offer if Bob remains at $800,000 or lower."
