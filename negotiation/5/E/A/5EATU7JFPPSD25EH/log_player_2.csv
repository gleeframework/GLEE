Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That initial price is quite high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $500,000 range. Let me know if that's a starting point we can work with."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This price reflects the unique benefits this product offers.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but let's be realistic about the value this product brings. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,700,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement you've made so far.  However, the gap between our valuations is still pretty wide.  To be frank, anything above $800,000 is a non-starter for me. I'd be willing to go to $750,000 if that would get us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've been flexible, but we're running out of room to make this work. I'm aware of other interested buyers, and to be frank, $750,000 is simply too far below its worth. My final offer is $1,400,000.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and she's unlikely to move significantly from $1,400,000.  You've already stated your firm limit is $800,000. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John.  While you might be able to negotiate Alice down a bit further, it's highly unlikely she'll reach your desired price point.  John offers a sure thing within your budget."
