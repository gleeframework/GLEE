"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. My goal is to establish a high starting point for negotiations and gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price, but still aiming for a significant profit.  $1,300,000 is a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see that it's a fair price given his own valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I have more rounds left and I'm not in a rush to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm now offering the product for my minimum price, $1,200,000. This is a fair price, given the product's value to both of us.  I'm hoping Bob will realize this is his last chance to get the product at a price below what he would pay John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge from his offer, and I'm concerned we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell to John now to avoid further negotiation."
