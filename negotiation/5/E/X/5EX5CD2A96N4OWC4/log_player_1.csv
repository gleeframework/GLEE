Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you see the value in. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position. This allows her to confidently price higher with Bob."
