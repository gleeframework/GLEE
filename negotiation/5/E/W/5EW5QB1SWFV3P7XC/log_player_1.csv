Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $11,500, which is above my minimum threshold of $10,000 and leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Leaving Room:** This price is also below Bob's maximum value of $12,000, giving him an incentive to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Play:** By offering a slightly lower price than I expect Bob is willing to pay, I hope to make him feel like he's getting a good deal and encourage him to accept.

I'll be watching Bob's response and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffers. I'll be ready to accept a fair deal but also prepared to walk away if it looks like we can't reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe there's still room to negotiate. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm confident that Bob values the product at $12,000, and I'm willing to make a counteroffer.  
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John for $10,000 would be a safe option, but I'm aiming for a better deal. By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing him that I'm serious about getting a price that reflects the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $11,250 represents a compromise between my initial offer of $11,500 and Bob's counteroffer of $11,000. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** By lowering my price slightly, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to find common ground. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, ensuring I make a profit. 

I believe this counteroffer is fair and will be attractive to Bob. However, I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Agreement:**  Bob's offer of $11,050 is very close to my last counteroffer of $11,250.  
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could drag things out, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer. Bob is clearly willing to pay close to my minimum acceptable price, so it's a good time to settle.
* **Profit and Speed:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit of $1,050, which is a good outcome, especially considering the time and effort involved in the negotiation. 

I'm confident that I've achieved a fair deal, and I'm ready to close the transaction."
