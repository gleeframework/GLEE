"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $100. This means you can save $20 by accepting her offer. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is not optimal.**  If you reject her offer, you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Buying from John is a worse option.** This would cost you more money and not make sense strategically."
