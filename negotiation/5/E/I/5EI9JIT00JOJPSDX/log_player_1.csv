Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth significantly more than my asking price. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you're in a strong position. This allows you to aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob specifically, aiming to justify a higher price. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, you might engage in back-and-forth negotiation with Bob.  This offer aims to maximize profit in a single interaction."
