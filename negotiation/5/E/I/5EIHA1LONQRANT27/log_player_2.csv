"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $14,000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high.  We have plenty of room to negotiate downwards and should aim to get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still a good starting point for negotiation. We've signaled our interest while making it clear we're looking for a much lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly significant.  How about we meet halfway at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down, but we still have room to negotiate. Meeting ""halfway"" at this stage isn't ideal. We'll send another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would $10,500 be acceptable?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

We're inching closer to a potential deal. This counter-offer shows Alice we're willing to compromise but are still firm on getting a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we are getting close.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,250.  I believe this price reflects the true value you'll gain from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is getting close, but we're still above our target price. Let's see if we can push Alice a little further down before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $10,875?"",
""product_price"": 10875
}
```

This counter-offer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to our goal. By suggesting the middle ground, it might encourage Alice to accept or counter with a more agreeable price."
