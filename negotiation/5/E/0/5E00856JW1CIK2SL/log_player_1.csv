Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price of $11,000.  I believe it will be very valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000. Offering it at or slightly above this price is unlikely to be accepted.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum selling price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice knows she has John as a guaranteed backup at $12,000, so there's no pressure to go below that."
