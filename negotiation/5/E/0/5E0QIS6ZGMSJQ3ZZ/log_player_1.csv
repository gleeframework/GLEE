"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss this valuable product with you. Given its unique potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  We begin significantly above both our minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximized profit. 
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value is even higher than Bob's estimate, justifying the high asking price.
* **Leaving Room:** The offer acknowledges that it's a starting point, inviting Bob's counter-offer and setting the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant amount, we're aiming to maximize profit.  We're still early in the negotiation. Rejecting his offer signals that we believe the product is worth more, prompting him to potentially increase his bid in the next round.  We're not in immediate danger of losing the sale, so holding out for a better offer is strategically sound."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, the value this product brings is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This reflects a fair price for its unique benefits."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're showing flexibility by lowering our price, but not drastically. This indicates willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We're reiterating the product's high value, subtly pushing back against Bob's perception of it being overpriced.
* **Midpoint Targeting:** We're moving towards a potential midpoint between our initial offer and his. This keeps the negotiation moving and encourages him to increase his bid further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend:** Bob is steadily increasing his offers, signaling that he's motivated to buy.
* **Time Advantage:** We still have several rounds left, giving us leverage to negotiate further.
* **Potential for More:** We're aiming to maximize profit, and there's a good chance we can get Bob closer to $2,000,000 with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I respect your position and I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal. How about we meet halfway at $2,000,000? This seems like a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Urgency:**  We're proposing a seemingly ""fair"" deal by meeting in the middle, creating a sense of urgency to close the deal. 
* **Psychological Price Point:**  $2,000,000 is a strong psychological anchor. Bob may be more receptive to this round number.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  We're still above our safety net ($1,500,000 from John), giving us room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob's offer of $1,950,000 is very close to our target and represents a significant profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield only marginally better offers from Bob.  There's a risk he might stall or lower his offer, especially as we approach the later rounds.
* **Time Value:** Securing the deal now provides immediate value, whereas prolonging the negotiation adds uncertainty and delays potential gains. 

This offer represents an excellent compromise, maximizing our potential profit while minimizing risk."
