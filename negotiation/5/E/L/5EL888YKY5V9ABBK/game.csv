"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $15,000 to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me.  However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $16,000 for it.  What do you think?",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $17,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,500?  I'm really interested in this product and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16,500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $16,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",16750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $16,750 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still a bit hesitant.  How about we meet in the middle again at $16,625?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",16625.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at $16,725, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",16725.0,Alice,7,
