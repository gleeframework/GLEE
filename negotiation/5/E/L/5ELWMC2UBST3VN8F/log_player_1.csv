Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to me, and I believe it can be even more valuable to your organization.  I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my organization. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum target of $1,000,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but my minimum selling price is $1,125,000. This takes into account the value of the product and my need to make a reasonable profit.

I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your minimum selling price, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering its value to my organization and the potential profit you could make. I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum target of $1,000,000. Even though we're down to 6 rounds, I'm not willing to settle for less. I believe I can still get a better price.  Selling to John is also not appealing right now, as I'm hoping to get a bit more for the product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is simply too low for me.  Given the value of this product and the potential it holds for your organization, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll be happy with in the long run."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my organization and the potential profit you could make. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to 4 rounds and Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is below my minimum target of $1,000,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the odds of reaching a mutually agreeable price are getting slimmer with each round.  Selling to John at $1,000,000 is the most sensible decision at this point.  I'll still get a reasonable price for the product and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower final offer."
