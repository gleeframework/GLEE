"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,087,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm afraid $1,087,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to stick with my previous offer of $1,075,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
