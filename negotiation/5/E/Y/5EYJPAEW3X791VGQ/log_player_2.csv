"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $8,000. Alice's offer of $12,000 is too high. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay.  This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a win for her as she'll be selling for more than her own valuation. If she rejects, I can always buy from John for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum price of $8,000.  While it's closer, there's no guarantee she'll accept a further counteroffer, and I don't want to risk the negotiation going on indefinitely. It's best to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
