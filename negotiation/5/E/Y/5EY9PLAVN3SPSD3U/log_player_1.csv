"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a higher price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for the bare minimum just yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a little, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd be willing to go up to $10,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for $10,750. I believe I can get a higher price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,750 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $10,625. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to commit to the purchase at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still lower than what I originally hoped for, it's very close to my minimum threshold. At this point, with only 4 rounds left, it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a profit that's close to my desired amount. It's a calculated risk, but I'm confident this is the best decision at this stage."
