Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $850,000?

**Reasoning:**  Alice is very unlikely to go below $850,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
