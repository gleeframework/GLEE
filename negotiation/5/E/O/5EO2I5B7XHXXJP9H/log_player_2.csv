Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's price. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise.  He's still willing to pay a higher price than Alice's minimum but aims to get the best deal possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,000. This is still more than Bob's initial counteroffer of $8,500, but it's below Bob's maximum price of $10,000 and better than buying from John. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price without risking further negotiation."
