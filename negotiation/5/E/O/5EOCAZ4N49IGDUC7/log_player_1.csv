Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a starting point that gives me some room to negotiate while still earning more than my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to try to get a little closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, and it gives me a better chance of closing the deal without risking losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his price, and I've already made a counteroffer. I'm not willing to go lower, and I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation.  I'm comfortable selling to John for my minimum price, as that's what I would get if I continue negotiating with Bob."
