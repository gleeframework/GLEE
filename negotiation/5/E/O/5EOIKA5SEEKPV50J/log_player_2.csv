"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  My offer is significantly lower than Alice's, but it's still within the range of my budget and reflects my willingness to negotiate.

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that gets us closer to a deal, and it leaves room for both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** My offer is a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal.

Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much of my profit margin.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,060,000 is still above my budget.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, we're running out of rounds. At this point, it's more beneficial to lock in the deal with John for $1,000,000. This ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice before the negotiation window closes."
