"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a great deal for Bob, but he can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the initial discount, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, given its value to me. This reflects a significant discount for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer and counter again. While $850,000 is a good price, he can likely get it lower by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product for both of us. This shows my genuine interest, and I believe it's a good starting point for reaching an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $835,000. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept this offer. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next counteroffer and he'll have to buy from John at a much higher price. At $835,000, he's saving $365,000 compared to John's offer, which is a significant amount."
