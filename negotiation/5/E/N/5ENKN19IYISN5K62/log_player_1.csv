Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob without him rejecting the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $80. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale to John for $100.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 creates a sense of a ""deal"" for Bob (since it's less than your minimum) while still maximizing your potential profit. 

By starting at $95, there's a chance Bob might accept, giving you a $15 profit over selling to John."
