"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still securing a good profit. I'm also trying to be positive and encouraging in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a loss.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $7,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be willing to do $6,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $6,800 is still below what I consider acceptable.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I'm still hoping to reach a deal with you. How about $7,200? It's a compromise that's closer to my preferred price, and I believe it's still a good value for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I could meet you at $7,000. This price point works best for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $7,000 is close enough to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to secure a good profit now than to keep negotiating and potentially miss out on the sale."
