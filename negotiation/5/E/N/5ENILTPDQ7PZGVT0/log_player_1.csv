Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product for my minimum price of $1,200,000. This maximizes my chances of getting the best possible deal while still being able to sell to John if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000.  It's still a good price for Bob, but it's closer to my minimum.  This gives us both some wiggle room to hopefully find a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've gone through a few rounds of negotiation with Bob, but it seems like we're not going to be able to agree on a price that's acceptable to both of us.  It's getting too close to my minimum and I'm not willing to risk getting a lower price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This ensures that I get my desired price and it's a guaranteed sale."
