"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a higher price, hoping to maximize my profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and the number of rounds remaining.  I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $110?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept anything less than $120.  I'll counter his offer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'll also keep in mind that selling to John is a guaranteed $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is too low.  My minimum price is $120. How about we split the difference at $135? I'm willing to compromise to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I'll be happy with the product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and I'm confident I can make a good profit. I don't want to risk losing the deal by going to another round and having Bob walk away.  I'll accept his offer and be happy with the $125."
