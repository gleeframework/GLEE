"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $12,500?  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still giving you a good deal. Let's close this deal!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  But $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $12,000?  That's a fair price that's closer to what I need, and it still leaves you a significant profit margin.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $11,200, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to sell at that price, I'm ready to close the deal.",11200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I understand you're trying to get the best deal. But $11,200 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,800. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",11800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $11,400. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11400.0,Bob,8,
