Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a higher price.  $11,500 is still above my minimum, but I'm confident we can find a compromise that benefits both of us."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $12,500?  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still giving you a good deal. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is a decent price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point. We still have several rounds left, and I don't want to sell for less than I believe the product is worth."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  But $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $12,000?  That's a fair price that's closer to what I need, and it still leaves you a significant profit margin.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $11,200, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to sell at that price, I'm ready to close the deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,200 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. We have several rounds left, and I believe we can still reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I understand you're trying to get the best deal. But $11,200 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,800. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $11,400. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're down to the wire, and while $11,400 isn't my ideal price, it's still a good deal considering my minimum and the possibility of selling to John for $10,000.  I think it's time to close the deal and move on."
