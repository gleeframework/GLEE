"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable at an exceptional value. Considering its worth and the benefits it offers, I propose we set the price at $95. This way, you're still getting a great deal compared to its actual worth, while also allowing me to fairly compensate for my investment and time. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
