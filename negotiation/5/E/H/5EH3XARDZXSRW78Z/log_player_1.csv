Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on it. I am willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is better than selling to John, but I'm hoping for more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher.  How about $13,500?  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your follow-up offer, Alice. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose a price of $12500. This is my final offer within our budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $12,500 is still significantly better than selling to John for $10,000.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm willing to take the deal."
