Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.
* This price is higher than my minimum value of $1,200,000, giving me a profit.
* It also leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price.
* If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum value, ensuring I don't lose money."
