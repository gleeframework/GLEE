"I understand you're on a tight budget, but I need to make a profit. I can do $14000, and that's as low as I can go. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $13500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $14200, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14200.0,Alice,5,
