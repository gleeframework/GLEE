Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:** The offer is significantly lower than Bob's valuation of $8,000, giving him a good deal. This increases the chances of him accepting.
* **Value for Alice:** The offer is much higher than the ""safety net"" price of $15,000 from John, allowing Alice to earn a significant profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit by striking a balance between offering a good deal to Bob while still securing a price that is significantly above her minimum acceptable value."
