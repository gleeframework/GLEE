"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its worth, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is starting at $14,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds and can counteroffer. It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your range.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $13,000. 
* **You're saving money.**  You're getting the product for $2,000 less than you'd pay John.
* **There's still a risk of rejection.**  You could try to counteroffer again, but Alice might not budge further. It's better to secure the deal at a good price than risk losing out."
