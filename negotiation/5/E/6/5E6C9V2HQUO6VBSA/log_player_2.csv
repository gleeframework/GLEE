"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a good deal compared to Alice's perceived value, Bob can potentially get it for even cheaper.  There's no reason to accept the first offer when there's potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $100.  What about $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to close the gap quickly. He's demonstrating he's serious about buying, but also willing to push for a better price. This approach could potentially lead to a quick agreement or further negotiation depending on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. While $115 is closer to his target price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There is no guarantee that Alice won't lower her price further, so it's worth rejecting this offer and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit high at $115, but I'm willing to go up to $112.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate strategically.  He's demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Alice's offer, but still staying within his budget.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $114. Can we try that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $114. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $114
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $114, which is only $4 more than Bob's target price of $110.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice could reject his next counteroffer, leaving him with no deal at all. Additionally, he has the option to buy from John for $100, so accepting this offer provides a reasonable compromise and ensures a deal."
