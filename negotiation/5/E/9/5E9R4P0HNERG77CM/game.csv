"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I've thought about your offer, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1050000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1080000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.

"Thank you for your final proposal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1060000.
