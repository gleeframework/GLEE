"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in it.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1250000.  This is the absolute highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
