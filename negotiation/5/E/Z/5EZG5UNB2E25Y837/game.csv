"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too steep for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is a fair price that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  It's my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Bob,4,
