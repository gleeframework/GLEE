"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't accept $1050000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $1100000. This is the best price I can offer at this point.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but I'd like to see if we can do better than that. How about $980000?",980000.0,Bob,4,
