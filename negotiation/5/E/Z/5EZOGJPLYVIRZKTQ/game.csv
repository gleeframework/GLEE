"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand that the product is worth $15,000 to me, but I would like to propose a price of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves you with a good profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,
