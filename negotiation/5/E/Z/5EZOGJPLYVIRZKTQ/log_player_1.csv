"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a good middle ground. It's above my minimum of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see how Bob reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand that the product is worth $15,000 to me, but I would like to propose a price of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counter with a higher offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves you with a good profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
