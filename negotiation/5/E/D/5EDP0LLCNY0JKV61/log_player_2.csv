"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should aim to get the price lower and can likely do so by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm hoping for a slightly lower price to make this work for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  While Bob could potentially keep negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures a purchase at a good price."
