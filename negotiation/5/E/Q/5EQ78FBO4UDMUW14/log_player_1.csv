"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm countering with $1,500,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to the middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer is still far too low. I'm determined to get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to nudge him closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,300,000. This demonstrates flexibility, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will get Bob closer to my desired price,  as we're now getting closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not ready to sell for that price just yet.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and gets us very close to the middle ground. It's a good price for both of us and I'm hoping Bob will accept. If he doesn't, I'm going to go ahead and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I've reached my limit.  We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sacrifice a significant amount of money just to close a deal with Bob.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000.  This is a safe and secure deal, and it ensures I meet my minimum price."
