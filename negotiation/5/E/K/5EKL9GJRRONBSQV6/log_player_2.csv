# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great opportunity for you! I'm willing to sell you this amazing product for $140. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer

While $140 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer.  This might encourage her to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $120. If not, you can always buy from John for $150."
