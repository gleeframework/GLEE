"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,200,000 is below its true value and my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects its worth while still being a good deal for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. How about we meet at $1,250,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,275,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,250,000. How about we meet at $1,225,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. To demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,260,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair given the value this product brings.",1260000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,260,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we meet at $1,225,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1225000.0,Bob,8,
