"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I recognize the product's potential, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  To start negotiations, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This reflects a fair price considering my needs and the market value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for providing yours. While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position but $1,900,000 remains outside of my budget. To demonstrate my seriousness about this deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise and a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. While $1,700,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  To find common ground, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This demonstrates my strong interest in this product and represents a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
