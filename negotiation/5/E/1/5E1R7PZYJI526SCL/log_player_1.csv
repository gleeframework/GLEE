Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.  I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you have room to start high.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** While not revealing your absolute bottom line, hinting at the product's value to Bob specifically might make him more amenable to a higher price. 
* **Direct Approach:**  The message is clear and to the point, aiming to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. 
* Gauge Bob's reactions and adjust your strategy accordingly. If he seems put off by the high price, you can always lower it during the negotiation.
* Remember, your absolute floor is $1,200,000 because you have John as a guaranteed buyer."
