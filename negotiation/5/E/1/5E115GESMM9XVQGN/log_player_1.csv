"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000.  This is my best offer and reflects the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth a lot, but I still believe $950,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial lowball. We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate without settling for less than our backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers?  Let's say $1,025,000, this demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above the target price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently moving upward in his offers, showing he's willing to pay more. We are getting closer to John's offer, but we still have room to negotiate for a price closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to accept a small compromise to finalize the deal quickly.  Let's settle at $1,010,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```

**Reasoning:** By framing this as our ""final offer"" and making a smaller concession, we create a sense of urgency while still staying above John's price.  This tactic might encourage Bob to agree to avoid losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is very slowly increasing his offers and we're now below our safety net of John's $1,000,000 offer.  It's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer in the remaining two rounds to make continuing worthwhile.  Accepting John's offer guarantees us a $1,000,000 profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away at the last minute."
