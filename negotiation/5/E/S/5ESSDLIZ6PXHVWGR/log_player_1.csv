Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and shows confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take the $1,400,000, I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell at his price. Hopefully, this will lead to a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum acceptable price that it makes sense to accept. While I could potentially get a bit more by continuing negotiations, there's no guarantee I'll succeed and the risk of losing the deal to John is too high.  $1,480,000 is a good compromise, and securing the sale is more important than pushing for an extra $20,000."
