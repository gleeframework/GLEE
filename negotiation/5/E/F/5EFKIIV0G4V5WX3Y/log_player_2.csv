{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $100. 
* This is a good deal for you, but you can likely do better. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* You're starting with a counteroffer that's a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. 
* This shows Alice you're serious about getting a deal, but also that you're willing to walk away. 
* You have 9 rounds left, so you have room to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $95. This is a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than your maximum price of $120 and still above Alice's minimum price of $80.
* While you could potentially get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk that you'll lose the deal entirely. 
* It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
