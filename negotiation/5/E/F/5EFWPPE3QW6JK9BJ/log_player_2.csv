"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice. You know you can buy it for $80 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $95 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you can get from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90. That would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it right away.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $92? That's closer to your offer, and still a fair price for the value of this product. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's tempting to accept Alice's offer of $92, but it's still above your price point of $80. You can still get a better deal from John.  Continue to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get her closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $92 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to pay $88. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $88 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $90 is still above your desired price point of $80. You have reached a point where the negotiations are likely to continue to be slow and tedious. It's more efficient and financially beneficial to purchase the product from John at $80."
