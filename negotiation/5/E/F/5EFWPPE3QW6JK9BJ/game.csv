,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90. That would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it right away.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $92? That's closer to your offer, and still a fair price for the value of this product. Let's try to close this deal.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $92 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to pay $88. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $88 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,7,
