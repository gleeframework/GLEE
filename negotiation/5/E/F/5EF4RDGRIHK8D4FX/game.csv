"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential you'll gain from owning it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for moving on the price.  I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, my budget is closer to $11,000. If you can meet me somewhere around there, I think we can close this deal today.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000, which is a significant concession. Let's meet halfway. If we can agree on this price, we can finalize the deal today.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. I'm ready to close the deal today if we can agree on a price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's a fair compromise, and we both walk away happy.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $12,500 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle on $13,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,7,
