Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below what I need for this product. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value it brings. Let's meet in the middle.

Alice has met my highest acceptable price. There's no point in rejecting and potentially missing out on the deal."
