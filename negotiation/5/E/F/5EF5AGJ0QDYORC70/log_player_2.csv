"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and provide significant value.  Given its quality and features, I'm offering it at $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is way above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds and Alice is motivated to sell, so there's room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product,  $16,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. This is my best offer, considering my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting point:**  Alice's offer is way too high.  We're starting with a low counteroffer to see if there's any room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** The message explains your budget constraints and frames your offer as a reasonable starting point.  
* **Strategic move:**  This counteroffer shows Alice you are serious about buying but also sets a firm price you're comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value this product highly, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $14,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than your budget of $10,000. You still have time to negotiate further and potentially get a better price. It's worth rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $11,500. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  Instead of going back down to your original $10,500, we're showing willingness to meet in the middle. This shows good faith and keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Reasoning:** We're framing the offer as a ""fair price"" for both parties, which can be persuasive. 
* **Pressure:** This counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to accept, as she's already lowered her price and it's getting closer to your desired price."
