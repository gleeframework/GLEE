Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Savings:**  Buying from Alice saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Alice's initial offer is close to Bob's maximum, there's always the potential to negotiate further.  Bob could try to counter with a lower price, leveraging the fact that he has another option (John)."
