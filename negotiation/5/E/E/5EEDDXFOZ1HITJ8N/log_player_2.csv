"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm only willing to pay $12,500 for the product. It's still a good price for you, and it's the highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Justifying the offer:** Bob provides a reason for his offer, highlighting the benefit for Alice in terms of the price.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  The counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter with a slightly higher price, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet halfway.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is closer to his budget than Alice's first offer, it's still above his maximum. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating for a lower price.  There's a chance that Alice might be willing to come down further, and he doesn't want to miss that opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? That would be a fair compromise, and we could close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway, showing good faith and increasing the chances of reaching an agreement. 
* **Fairness:** Bob justifies his counteroffer by framing it as a ""fair compromise."" 
* **Clear goal:** The offer is clear and directly states the price Bob is willing to pay, leaving no ambiguity.
* **Urgency:** The ""close the deal"" phrase subtly suggests that Bob is ready to finalize the deal if Alice agrees."
