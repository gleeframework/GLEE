"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is above his budget and he can get the product from John for $15,000.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, he can still get the product for $15,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if she'll come down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $16,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice has come down in price, she's still asking for more than Bob is willing to pay.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, making it the more sensible option at this point."
