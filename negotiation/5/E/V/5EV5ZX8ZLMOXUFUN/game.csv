"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand that $14,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I can offer you a price of $16,500. Is this more in line with what you were thinking?"
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",15500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15,500, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if I can make a profit at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,500 and my initial offer of $18,000. I can offer you a price of $16,750. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?"
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $16,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,5,,
