Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate but still leaves you with a significant profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you don't sell for less than your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's a clear opening:** This allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation. 

Remember, you can always adjust this price based on Bob's response and the potential for a counteroffer.  You also have the option to sell to John at any time for your desired price.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is higher to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $800,000 for it. This aligns with my valuation of the product. Please let me know if this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a decent price, it's significantly lower than my minimum of $1,200,000. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but still acknowledging his valuation. I'll aim for a compromise that allows me to earn a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your valuation, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product for $900,000. This price is a fair compromise, considering our respective valuations.  Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort to reach a compromise. However, I still believe $800,000 is the maximum I can realistically pay for the product. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firm on his price, and I'm unwilling to compromise further.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if we could agree, my minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000.  

Since Bob is unlikely to budge, it makes more sense to sell to John.  This ensures I receive my minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
