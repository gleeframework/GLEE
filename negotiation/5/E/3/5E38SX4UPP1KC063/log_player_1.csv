{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value is high. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a starting point. By offering $1,200,000, I'm aiming for a good compromise between my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while still getting a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to close the deal, accepting his offer would mean losing a significant amount of money. I'll counteroffer to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $1,100,000? This would still be a great deal for you, given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down from your original price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a decent compromise. It's significantly higher than his initial offer and still a profitable deal for me.  Accepting his offer is the best course of action at this point."
