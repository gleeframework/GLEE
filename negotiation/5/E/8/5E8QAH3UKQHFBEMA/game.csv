"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  I'm offering you the product for $12,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,750. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your counter offer. To be honest, $11,750 is a little too close to John's offer for me to justify continuing to negotiate. I'd be willing to pay $11,500. If you can do that, I'll take it. Otherwise, I think I'll go with John. ",11500.0,Bob,6,
