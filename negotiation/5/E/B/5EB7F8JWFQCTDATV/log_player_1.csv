Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. Any offer above this is a loss for him.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  The potential prices where both you and Bob benefit exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to get as close to $1,499,999 as possible without Bob rejecting the offer.  Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** This gives you room to negotiate down and might make Bob think the product is even more valuable.
2. **Justification:** Offer a brief, plausible reason for the high price, even if it's just scarcity or high demand.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase the product. Due to its unique value and high demand, I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the current market.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 gives you significant bargaining room.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique value"" and ""high demand"" creates a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Open to Negotiation:** ""Let me know your thoughts"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate down slightly if needed, but always keep your $1,500,000 fallback option with John in mind."
