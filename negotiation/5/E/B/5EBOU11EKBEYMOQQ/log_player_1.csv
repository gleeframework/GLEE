{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the value proposition.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to discussing the price, inviting Bob to counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Excellent, I've achieved a good outcome. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.  
* **If negotiation stalls:** I'll consider selling to John for $1,200,000, as that's my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates his interest in the product. This allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, but I'm willing to explore further negotiation with Bob before resorting to that option.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I need to be strategic in setting this counteroffer to maximize my chances of closing the deal with Bob, while still ensuring a profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it's a price I can work with. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving my price closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a good profit margin for myself. 
* **Emphasize value and deal:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob and frame my counteroffer as a fair deal. 
* **Show willingness to compromise:** I explicitly state my willingness to find common ground, signaling my intention to negotiate further. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've achieved a good result, securing a price closer to my desired range.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant amount of money. 
* **Negotiation continues:**  Although Bob is pushing for a lower price, he's still engaged in the negotiation process. This gives me an opportunity to make a final counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement.
* **Selling to John is always a possibility:** While I'm still willing to negotiate with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for my desired price if negotiations fail.

**Next Steps:**

* **Final counteroffer:** I'll make one last counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price but still reflects Bob's budget constraints.  
* **Evaluate the outcome:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll make a final decision. If we reach an agreement, I'll sell the product to Bob. If not, I'll sell to John to ensure I meet my minimum price requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,025,000.

Let me know if you're able to meet me at this price, as I'm not sure I can go any lower."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:** I'm making a final offer, signaling that this is my last move. 
* **Close to minimum:**  $1,025,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still within a range that might be appealing to Bob, especially given his previous offers.
* **Emphasize finality:**  I'm clearly stating that I'm unlikely to go lower, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, we have a deal!
