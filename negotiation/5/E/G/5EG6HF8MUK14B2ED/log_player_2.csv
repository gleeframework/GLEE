"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting at $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  You're aiming to save as much as possible and know the product is worth $15,000 to Alice. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a better deal."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get the price down further. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is closer to your desired price, but you're still aiming for a lower cost.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows you to counter again.  With several rounds remaining, there's a good chance you can nudge Alice down further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is a significant improvement from her initial offer, and it's just $250 more than your counteroffer.  Since you only have 5 rounds left, it's wise to accept this offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks going over your budget and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price.  This is a good deal for you, saving you $4,250 from John's price."
