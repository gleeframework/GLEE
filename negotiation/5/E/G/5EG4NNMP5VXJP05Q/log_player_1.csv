"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd love! I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to build rapport.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm framing it as a discussion, allowing Bob to counteroffer if he's not happy with the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle right away.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  There are 8 more rounds, and I can always sell to John for $100 if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me. How about $125?  That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Rationale:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (""fair compromise"") to make it sound more reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price.  $110 is only $10 away from my initial asking price of $120 and $10 above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to accept this offer and secure a sale."
