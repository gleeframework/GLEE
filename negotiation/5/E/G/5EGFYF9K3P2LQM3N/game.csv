"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you showing me the product. While I do think it's a good product, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be willing to do $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $725,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
