"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? That's a fair offer, considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is truly significant and $10,000 is too low.  How about we settle at $12,500? This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
