"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $750,000.  Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good deal for Bob! Getting the product for $775,000 is a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,000,000. While there might be a slight chance of getting the price lower in further rounds, the difference is getting smaller, and Alice seems firm on her ""final offer."" It's better to take the win now rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
