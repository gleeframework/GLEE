"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to gauge Bob's interest and establish a strong starting point for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round based on his response."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling the product to John for $800,000. 

The negotiation with Bob has been frustratingly slow, and we're close to my minimum price, but with only two rounds left, it's likely I won't be able to reach a higher price. It's better to secure the sale with John and avoid further risk of losing out on a sale altogether."
