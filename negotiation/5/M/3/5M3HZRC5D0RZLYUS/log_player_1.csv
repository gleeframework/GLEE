Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think it's worth at least $120, but to get things started, I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I think the product is worth around $95 to me. Would you consider lowering the price to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $100. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value the product at $100, I'm willing to go down to $98 to make this deal work.  Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 98}
