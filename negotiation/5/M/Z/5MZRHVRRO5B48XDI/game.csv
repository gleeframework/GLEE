"Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire an item that is valued at $10,000 by you, but we believe it has even greater value and thus set this price. Please let me know if you are interested in discussing further.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. In light of this, I would like to offer the product to you for $11,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.",11000.0,Alice,3,
