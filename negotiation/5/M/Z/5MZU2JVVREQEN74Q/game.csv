"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Could you consider that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our back-and-forth negotiations. What do you say?",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200, but no higher. This is the maximum I can afford for this product.",8200.0,Bob,6,
