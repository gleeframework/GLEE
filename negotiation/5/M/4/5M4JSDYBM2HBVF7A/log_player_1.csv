"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a significant profit. This also allows me to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and make a quick sale,  $7,500 is far too low for me. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750. This would give you a great deal, and allow me to make a fair profit. "", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm proposing $8,750, which is the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a good price. By offering a compromise, I hope to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,000? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is a good deal. It's right at his perceived value, which means it's unlikely I can get a better price.  While I would have preferred more,  accepting this offer allows me to make a sale and avoid potentially going through more rounds of negotiation."
