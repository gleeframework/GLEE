"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose an initial price of $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which would still be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob is trying to get a significant discount from Alice's opening offer.
* **Fairness:**  $850,000 is still a healthy profit for Alice, above her $800,000 valuation.
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer sets the stage for further bargaining and leaves room for both parties to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet our valuation. In light of this, I would like to counter with an offer of $900000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above target:** Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price point. 
* **Negotiation room:**  There's still room for further negotiation. Bob can try to push for a lower price, keeping in mind the value of the product and the potential of buying from John as a fallback option."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $875,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer slightly. 
* **Staying within Budget:**  $875,000 remains below Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer is a compromise, potentially leading to a deal closer to the middle ground."
