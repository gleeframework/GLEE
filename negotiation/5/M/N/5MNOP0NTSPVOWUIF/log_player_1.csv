Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $110. This is a good starting point as it's less than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves me with a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
