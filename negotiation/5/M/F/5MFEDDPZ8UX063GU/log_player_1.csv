"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation but establishes a strong starting point.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept a slightly higher price. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** Ending with a question encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and makes him feel more involved in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $8000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value. Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob is unwilling to pay my initial price, he has shown interest in the product.  This means there's still room for negotiation.  
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John is a safe option, but it's not my ideal outcome. I still want to explore getting closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a slightly lower price in the next round, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $9,500 to $8,500, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm still emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product, even though it's a lower price. 
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Framing:** This phrase suggests a win-win scenario and encourages a sense of compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $8200 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his initial $8,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Despite his reluctance, Bob is still willing to negotiate. This shows potential for a better deal in future rounds.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $10,000, I'm hopeful that I can secure a price closer to that by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his current offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  Let's meet at $8,300.  This is just a little higher than your offer, and it's still a great deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm only raising the price by $100, showing a willingness to be flexible and find a compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language (""great deal"", ""happy to continue"") to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Focus on the Deal:** I'm highlighting the value of the deal for Bob, emphasizing the fair price he's being offered.

**Next Steps:** I'm cautiously optimistic that Bob might accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed.  I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still committed to finding the best deal for me. I am willing to pay $8100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,100 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, the gap between our desired prices is still significant.  He seems unlikely to go much higher, and I'm unwilling to drop much lower.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees a price of $10,000, which is my ideal outcome. However, I still see some potential for a slightly better deal with Bob, making me hesitant to close the deal with John just yet.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a compromise that is closer to my desired price. However, I will be prepared to sell to John if the negotiation continues to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I'm happy to try to meet you halfway.  I'm willing to come down to $8,200 for this product. It's a fair offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This offer is very close to Bob's last offer, making it a strong final attempt to close the deal.
* **Emphasizing Fair Offer:** I'm framing this offer as fair and the ""best I can do"" to increase the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Call to Action:** I'm adding a call to action (""Let's see if we can make this happen"") to encourage Bob to make a decision.

**Next Steps:** 

If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John, as I'm nearing my limit for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your efforts to meet my needs. I am still committed to finding the best deal for myself. I am willing to pay $8150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate, with Bob refusing to go higher and me unwilling to go lower. 
* **Time Constraints:** We only have two rounds left, and the likelihood of a deal with Bob is slim.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable value.

**Conclusion:**  While I would have preferred to get a higher price from Bob, the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high. Selling to John is the most logical and secure decision at this point."
