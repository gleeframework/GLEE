"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000.  It's a great deal for a product worth $1000000 to you.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $1000000?  That's still a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go back to the original price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950000 is closer, it's still not quite there yet. Let's try $1050000.  This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow us to close this deal.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $980000 is still quite a bit lower than my expectation.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1015000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can close this deal.  What do you say?",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $1015000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $985000?",985000.0,Bob,8,
