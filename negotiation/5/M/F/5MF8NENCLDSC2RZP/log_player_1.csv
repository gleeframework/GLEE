"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth $1,000,000 to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the value Bob will get from the product, increasing his incentive to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to engage and counter-offer.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure the highest possible price within the 10 rounds.  Starting high allows me to potentially get closer to my ideal price while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob's counteroffer is reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my desired price. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially considering my backup option with John.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our positions. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:**  I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer to show respect and maintain a positive tone.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I highlight the compromise of meeting at the middle point of our initial positions, showcasing my flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value, suggesting that $1,000,000 is still a good deal for him.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise, I'm aiming to find a middle ground and move the negotiation closer to my desired price while demonstrating flexibility.  If Bob still refuses, I'm prepared to counter again or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go back to the original price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is still below my desired price point.  While it's a step in the right direction, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value, especially with John ready to pay $1,200,000.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, pushing for a price closer to my desired value. The goal is to find a compromise that benefits both of us, but I won't accept a deal that's too far below my minimum acceptable value. If negotiations don't yield a satisfactory outcome, I'm prepared to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer, it's still not quite there yet. Let's try $1,050,000.  This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow us to close this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledgement:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and express appreciation for his willingness to compromise.
* **New Counteroffer:** I offer a price of $1,050,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's last offer but lower than my previous counteroffer, showing flexibility.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I highlight the potential benefit for Bob, emphasizing a ""great deal"" while also positioning it as a way to close the deal.
* **Open-ended Question:** I conclude with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

By offering a counteroffer that bridges the gap, I aim to find a middle ground while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. The goal is to maintain a balance between firmness and flexibility, pushing for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $980,000 is still below my desired price point.  While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 remains a very attractive option.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, pushing for a price closer to my desired value. I need to consider the time factor, as I'm getting close to the 10-round limit. However,  I'll aim for a price above $1,000,000 if possible. If negotiations don't yield a satisfactory outcome, I'm prepared to sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $980,000 is still quite a bit lower than my expectation.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,015,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1015000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledgement:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and his statement about getting ""too far apart"". 
* **Counteroffer:** I propose a price of $1,015,000, which is a compromise between our last offers and still above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that this is a ""fair compromise"" for both of us, making it more attractive to Bob.
* **Closing the Deal:** I reiterate the goal of ""closing the deal"" to increase Bob's urgency.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a Middle Ground:** It's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Increase Urgency:**  The emphasis on closing the deal adds pressure on Bob to accept, as we are nearing the round limit.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  I'm open to further negotiation if Bob is still not willing to accept, but my minimum value is still firmly set.

With only three rounds remaining, I need to find a solution that benefits both of us. If this counteroffer is rejected, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $1015000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $985000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the final three rounds and Bob's offer of $985,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  While I've been willing to negotiate, time is running out and the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  I'm also increasingly concerned that Bob might continue to lowball his offers, especially as we get closer to the final round.

Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a much better profit and removes the uncertainty of further negotiations.  

**Strategy:**

While it's always tempting to try and squeeze out a few more dollars, sometimes it's wiser to secure a known, profitable deal.  The risk of further negotiations failing and ending with a worse deal is too high at this point.  Selling to John is the most prudent decision."
