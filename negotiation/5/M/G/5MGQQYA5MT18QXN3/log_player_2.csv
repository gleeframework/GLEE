"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $9000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still above her own value of the product ($8,000), it's lower than your maximum budget ($10,000) and lower than John's price ($10,000). Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
