"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12000 is a good starting point,  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12750?  It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,
