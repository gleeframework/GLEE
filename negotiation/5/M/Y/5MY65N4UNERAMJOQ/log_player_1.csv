Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum goal of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work towards a mutually beneficial price. How about $120 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I need to try to get a better price, so I will reject his offer and counter with my own."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $120 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose $140 as my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price, so I will reject his offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? This is my minimum price, and it would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 150}
