"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a premium price for this unique item.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering its market value. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your understanding, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the market value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. I believe this price reflects the product's true worth and is a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll take it for $1,125,000.  This price is still above what I'd pay from John, but it shows I'm serious about making a deal with you.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad to see you're serious about the deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,125,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
