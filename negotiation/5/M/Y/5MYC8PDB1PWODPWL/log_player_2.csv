"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can likely get a better price by negotiating with her. It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to buying from John at a much higher price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $1,150,000. This still allows you a substantial gain while recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  There's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer again to try and get closer to my desired price point."
