Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential surplus for both of you.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he declines, you go with John.

**The Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects a significant return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** You're not beating around the bush. You state your offer clearly.
* **Value Emphasis:**  You highlight the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly reminding Bob why he's interested.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,350,000 leaves a $150,000 profit margin for Bob, while giving you a significant gain over your alternative offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start a bit lower, but still above $1,000,000.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a slightly more generous offer might be beneficial. 

**Remember:** This is just one offer strategy. There's always an element of risk in negotiation, but this approach gives you a strong chance of maximizing your profit."
