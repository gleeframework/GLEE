"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate you being open to negotiation.  While I'm interested in the product, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob!  I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to make a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
