Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly greeting and highlights the value Bob would get from the product. It then offers a price that is significantly higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  

By giving a reason for the price and being open to discussion, this approach aims to encourage Bob to engage in further negotiation rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 110}
