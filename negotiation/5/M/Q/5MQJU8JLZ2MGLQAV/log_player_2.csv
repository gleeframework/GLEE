Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Alice's offer of $110 is a good deal for me. It's lower than what I'd pay John, and it's closer to my desired price of $100.  I'll accept the offer."
