"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product. After careful consideration, we have decided to offer it to you at a special price of $950,000. We believe this is a fair offer considering the value you would receive from the product. Please let us know if you are interested in proceeding. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can definitely get a better deal than $950,000.  Alice is willing to sell for at least $800,000, and Bob has a maximum of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and its significance to you, I propose a price of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the true value of the product. I look forward to your response.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. There is still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of this, I would like to propose a price of $885,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product and my need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  Bob's counteroffer of $875,000 was rejected, meaning Alice is firm on a price around $885,000.  This is a good deal for Bob, as it's well within his budget and significantly lower than the price he'd pay from John.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a favorable price."
