Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $900,000 to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle.

Alice's offer:
