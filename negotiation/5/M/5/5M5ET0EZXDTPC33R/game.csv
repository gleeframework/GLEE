"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. While $1400000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you, and I'm prepared to reduce my asking price to $1600000. This price reflects the value we both recognize in this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
