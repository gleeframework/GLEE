Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and potential, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're open to it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and engaging in this negotiation.  While $1,600,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product sits significantly higher. Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000? This price reflects a willingness to meet in the middle while still acknowledging the product's immense potential."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,450,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to offer significantly more than $1,450,000. Accepting his offer means a loss compared to selling to John. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
