"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves room for both of us to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
