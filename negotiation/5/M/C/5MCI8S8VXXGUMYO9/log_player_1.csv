{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum value ($80).  I'm aiming to get a higher price if possible, but if Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum value."
