Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150.  This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $150.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. Hopefully, this is a reasonable price for him, but still leaves me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is too low for me. I'd rather sell to John for $120 and guarantee my minimum profit."
