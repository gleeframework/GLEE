Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I still have 9 rounds left to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1750000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1500000, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While I'm tempted to take the deal, I still have 6 rounds left and I think I can potentially get a better price, especially since Bob is willing to add ""extras""."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,625,000?  This would give us both a fair price and allow us to close the deal quickly.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1625000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,550,000 is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I have 4 rounds left, and I'm hoping to push for a bit more, especially since he keeps mentioning ""extras"". I want to see if I can get him to commit to a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's really my final offer.  If you're serious about this deal, let's close it now. Otherwise, I'm going to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1600000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $1550000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional extras to make it a good deal for both of us. Can you reconsider your offer?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Even though it's only $50,000 more than John's offer, it's still a better deal since Bob is also offering ""extras"" which could potentially add more value to the sale. With only two rounds left, there is no guarantee that I can push for a higher price. I'm going to secure this deal before I risk losing both Bob and John."
