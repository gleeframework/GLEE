"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is less than your $1,500,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is motivated to sell as the product is only worth $800,000 to her. By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to get a better price, closer to her actual valuation."
