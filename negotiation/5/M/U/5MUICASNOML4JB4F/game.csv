"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130.  It's a great deal for you, and it's still a decent price for me.  What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,100.0
"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to get a good deal.",90.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand you want a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen.",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,95.0
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95, as I mentioned before, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $97.50? I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",97.5,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $105?  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my bottom line.  Let's try to make this work.",105.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,98.0
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $102.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $102.5 is still a bit below what I need, but I'm willing to go down to $104.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",104.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,100.0
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $104 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer. How about $100? I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable to you.",100.0,Bob,8,,
