Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) is key to maximizing profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It signals a willingness to be somewhat flexible. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids the potential delay of going to John, even if John offers a slightly higher price. This ""time value"" is factored into the offer.
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a strong fallback position. This allows for a bolder opening offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob might outright reject $10,000. However, this strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher profit."
