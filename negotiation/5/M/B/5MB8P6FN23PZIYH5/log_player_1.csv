Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you if he accepts outright.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John at $120, so there's no risk of losing the sale entirely."
