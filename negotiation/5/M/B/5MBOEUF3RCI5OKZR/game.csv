"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's start the negotiation with a strong base.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. The product's value is significantly higher, and I need to recoup a good portion of that. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $775,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $725,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $725,000. It's important for me to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to drop my price a little further to $750,000. This is a final offer from me. If you're not able to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $750,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $725,000, as I mentioned before. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",725000.0,Bob,6,
