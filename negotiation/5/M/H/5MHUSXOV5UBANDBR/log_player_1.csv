Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to walking away and exploring other options.

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to push for more, Bob's tone suggests this is his absolute limit and he's ready to walk away. Accepting $1,500,000 is a significant profit, and it's better to secure a deal now than risk losing him and having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000."
