Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm valuing it at $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in a negotiation. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he negotiates you down.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value"", Alice is subtly reinforcing the idea that the product is worth a significant amount. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, but rather open to discussion. This makes Bob more likely to engage rather than just reject the offer outright.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If Alice knows Bob to be extremely price-sensitive, she might lower the initial offer slightly. However, starting high is generally a good strategy.
* **The market:** This assumes a situation where there isn't readily available pricing information for similar products. If Alice knows similar products often sell for around $8,000, she needs to be careful not to overprice significantly."
