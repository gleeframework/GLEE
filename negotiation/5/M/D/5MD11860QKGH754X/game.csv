"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that's worth $10,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, and I think you'll love the value it brings to your life. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $8,500. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle on $7,750? That's a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to go up to $8,250, but I don't think I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
