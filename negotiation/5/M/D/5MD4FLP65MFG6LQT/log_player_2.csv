"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a lower price than $140, since the product is worth less to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be willing to do $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
