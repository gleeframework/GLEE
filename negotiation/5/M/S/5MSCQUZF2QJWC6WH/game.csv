"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. While I'm interested in the product, $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $82. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $82 is still a bit above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $78.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still talking! I'm willing to meet you at $79. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",79.0,Alice,5,
