Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not satisfied with it. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm raising my offer slightly from Bob's minimum, hoping to meet him halfway. I'm willing to compromise a little, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I'm confident that I can sell to John for a higher price. I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John."
