"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product well worth the investment.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.50. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",100.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100.50 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still find the product a great value.  Let me know what you think.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not getting any closer to your target price, and I'm starting to think I should just go with John's offer. I'm willing to meet you at $102.50. That's as high as I'm willing to go.",102.5,Bob,6,
