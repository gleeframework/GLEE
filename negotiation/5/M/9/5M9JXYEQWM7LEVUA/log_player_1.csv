Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($100).
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have John willing to buy at $100 provides a safety net, allowing you to aim higher with Bob."
