"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for you, considering it's worth $800,000 to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it helps me get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This would give you a very good deal, and it helps me get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still above your preferred price range. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000. You've successfully negotiated with Alice but have reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price. Buying from John ensures you get the product within your budget and saves you the time and effort of continuing the negotiation."
