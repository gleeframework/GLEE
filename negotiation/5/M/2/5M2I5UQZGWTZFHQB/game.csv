"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay under $12,000. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  I think that's a fair price considering what the product is worth to both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the next round, so I'll offer it to you for $15,500. It's a fair price considering the value you place on it.",15500.0,Alice,5,
