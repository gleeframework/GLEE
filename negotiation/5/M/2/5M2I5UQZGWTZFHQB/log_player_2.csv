Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's far above his maximum budget.  He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her first offer, it's still above his ideal price point. He should try to counteroffer again and see if he can get closer to his target."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay under $12,000. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  I think that's a fair price considering what the product is worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the next round, so I'll offer it to you for $15,500. It's a fair price considering the value you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price Bob can afford.  John is offering the product at a price that fits Bob's budget, so it's the best option at this point."
