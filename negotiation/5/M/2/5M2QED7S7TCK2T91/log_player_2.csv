"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. While it's better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  A $200,000 drop from Alice's initial offer is a significant move, showing Bob's seriousness in negotiating.
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:**  The offer is still above Alice's desired price, leaving room for her to counter with a price closer to Bob's.
* **Focuses on Value:**  Bob emphasizes getting the product for a ""bit less,"" hinting at the value he places on it, not just trying to get the lowest price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met Bob halfway, lowering her price to $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from her initial offer, and a good deal for Bob.  At this price, Bob is saving $200,000 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further reductions, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away or the negotiations could drag on."
