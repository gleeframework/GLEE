Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to you. While it's a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to secure an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $850,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's the best offer I can make. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, $925,000 is still too high.  You have time left and can continue to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to offer you $875,000 for the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually agreeable price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $925,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you a deal at $915,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm willing to finalize the deal if you accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $915,000, which is very close to your last counteroffer of $875,000. With only a few rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids potentially getting stuck with John's higher price."
