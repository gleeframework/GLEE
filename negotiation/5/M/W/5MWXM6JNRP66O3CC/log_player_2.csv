"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $600,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $600,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better price.  There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, and Bob can always buy from John for $800,000 if the negotiation fails.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer.  However, $600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $550,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible, and he has 7 rounds remaining. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue exploring a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. However, $562,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $540,000. This is a fair offer, considering we've both moved closer to a compromise.  Let's finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 540000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $575,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm not willing to go any lower than this. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $575,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $575,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is Bob's last round to negotiate with Alice. While Alice has come down significantly in price, she's still unwilling to go as low as Bob's desired price. 

* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects Alice's offer and makes a counteroffer, it's highly likely Alice will reject it, leaving him with no other choice but to buy from John.

* **Time is Running Out:**  There's only one round left, and Bob doesn't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product.

* **Price Difference:**  The difference between Alice's final offer ($575,000) and John's price ($800,000) is substantial.  

Considering the risks and the potential savings, Bob is better off buying the product from John at $800,000.  It's a guaranteed purchase and allows him to avoid the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
