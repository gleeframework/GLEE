"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get the price lower.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a good start, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less. How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $11000?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good price for you.  You can save $4,000 compared to buying from John. While you might be able to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you having to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price."
