Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I still believe the product is worth more to you than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. You're still better off seeing if you can get a better deal by making another counteroffer or by buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,075,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll do $1,090,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is still above your budget of $1,000,000.  Since John is willing to sell you the product for your budget, it makes more sense to buy from him and avoid any further negotiation."
