Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but my initial price reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  There's still room to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
