Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my initial price reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value I place on the product and your need to sell, I'm willing to offer $975,000.  This is my final offer, so let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, Bob is firm on this being his final offer. Accepting $975,000 is a significant profit above my minimum, and there's always the risk Bob walks away in future rounds."
