"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, but he needs to offer something reasonable to start the negotiation.

* **Showing Flexibility:** The message emphasizes Bob's interest in the product and his willingness to negotiate."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $12500 is still a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $13,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** Alice's message indicates she's willing to negotiate further, suggesting there's room for a more favorable price.
