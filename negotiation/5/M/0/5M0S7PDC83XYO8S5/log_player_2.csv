# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below her stated minimum of $8,000. Since you can buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Alice and risk paying a higher price."
