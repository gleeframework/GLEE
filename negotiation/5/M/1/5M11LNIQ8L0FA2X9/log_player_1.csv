"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see how willing he is to pay for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is significantly lower than my minimum price, so I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130. This is still a bit higher than my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a fair price."
