"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price, considering your potential interest. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $12,000.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John as a last resort. This allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller."
