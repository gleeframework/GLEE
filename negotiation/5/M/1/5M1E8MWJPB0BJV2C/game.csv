"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. Is this a more comfortable price for you?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit constrained on budget, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",11500.0,Alice,5,
