Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least that much to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get him to pay a premium.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is upbeat and highlights the value of the product to Bob.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects my initial offer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $12,000 gives me the confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $11,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $11,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's message indicates he's willing to negotiate, and I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **John is a backup:**  I can still sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go lower than $12,000. This product is worth at least that much to me, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good investment. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm sticking to my minimum price, but my message is still friendly and open to negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him.
* **Compromise:**  I'm suggesting finding a middle ground to encourage further negotiation. 
* **No Pressure:** I'm not rushing Bob into a decision, but emphasizing the importance of the product to me."
