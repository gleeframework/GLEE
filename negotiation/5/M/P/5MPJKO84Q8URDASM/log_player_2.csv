"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value may be different for you. To start, I'll offer it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  You can likely get a better price. 
* **There's no need to rush.** You have 10 rounds and a backup option with John. 
* **Counteroffering shows you're a serious buyer and gives you negotiating power.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $95 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to offer it to you for $90. This is higher than my initial offer and closer to what you're suggesting, while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high.** You are trying to get the product for under $90, and you have the option to buy it for $100 from John.
* **Negotiation is ongoing.**  You still have time to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $90 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more room to work with.  I'm prepared to pay $88 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After considering your latest offer, I am able to move forward with a proposal of $89 for the product. This allows us to both reach a fair agreement. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is the best so far.** It's within your budget and getting close to your ideal price.
* **There's no guarantee of a better price.**  You've already made several counteroffers and Alice may not budge further.
* **You have a fallback option.**  If you reject this offer, you can still buy from John for $100.

By accepting, you save $11 compared to buying from John, and you get the product from Alice."
