"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. I'm willing to let it go for a price that I'm sure you'll find attractive.  While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product just yet, I can assure you it's worth no less than $1200000 to me.  Are you interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. Alice's offer is higher than that, so it's not in Bob's best interest to accept."
