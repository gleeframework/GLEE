"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $95.  This is the most I can afford, and I really want to get this product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
