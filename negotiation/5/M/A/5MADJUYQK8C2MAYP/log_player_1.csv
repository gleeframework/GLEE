Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a great deal for you, given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so there's room for you to potentially get a higher price.
* **It shows good faith:**  You're not immediately asking for the full $10,000, which could make Bob feel like you're trying to take advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept $7,000, you can do better.  You're confident that the product is worth $8,000 to you, and John is ready to pay that price. By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate, you have a chance to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still leaves you with a good deal, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's counteroffer is tempting, it's still below your minimum.  John is guaranteed to buy the product for $8,000, which is a more comfortable price.  It's not worth risking a lower price for the sake of continuing negotiations. You're better off selling to John and securing a price that meets your minimum."
