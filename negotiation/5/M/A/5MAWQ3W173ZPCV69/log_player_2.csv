"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's something you value highly, and I'm confident you'll find it useful. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150, Alice's message hints that you value the product highly. This suggests she might be willing to go lower. By rejecting the offer, you might prompt her to propose a better price. If not, you can always fall back on buying from John for $150."
