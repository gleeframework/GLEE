"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $12,000.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $7,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",8000.0,Alice,5,
