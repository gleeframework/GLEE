"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher at $20,000.  It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  John is a backup option, so it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $20,000, which is $5,000 over Bob's maximum price. A counteroffer of $12,000 represents a significant discount and allows for potential negotiation. This initial counteroffer gives Bob a good starting point, leaving room for further bargaining if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $18,000, which is still $3,000 over Bob's maximum price.  While it is closer to Bob's desired price than the previous offer, it's still not a good deal.  It is worth continuing the negotiation with Alice to see if a more acceptable price can be reached.  John remains a reliable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $18,000, which is still $3,000 higher than Bob's maximum price. Bob needs to get closer to his target price. A counteroffer of $14,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer and just slightly over Bob's maximum price.  This offer is reasonable and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $16,500, which is only $1,500 over Bob's maximum price. While it's still not ideal, it's much closer than previous offers.  Considering the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with no deal, it's prudent to accept this offer.  John is always a backup option, but Alice's current offer is within a reasonable range."
