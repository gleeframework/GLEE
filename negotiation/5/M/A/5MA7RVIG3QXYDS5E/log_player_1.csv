Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm setting the price at $17,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 17000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $17,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down. Even if he manages to bring you down to $16,000, you're still making more than selling to John. 
* **Confidence and Value:** Presenting a slightly higher price can create a perception of higher value for the product.

It's important to remember this is just one strategy.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style and your risk tolerance, you might adjust your approach."
