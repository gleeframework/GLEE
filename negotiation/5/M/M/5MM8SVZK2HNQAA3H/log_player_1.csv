Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  You're aiming for a profit, and this offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a sense that he can get a good deal and incentivizes him to negotiate. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, I can likely get closer to my desired price range.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm sticking with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely the closest I'll get to my initial desired price."
