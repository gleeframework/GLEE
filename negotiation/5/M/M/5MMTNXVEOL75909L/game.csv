"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise and gets us both closer to our goals. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is as close as I can get to your target without breaking my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $980,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $990,000 as a final compromise.  This price is just a small step away from your offer, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's make this deal happen!",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $990,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $985,000, which is as close as I can get to your target without breaking my budget. I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",985000.0,Bob,8,
