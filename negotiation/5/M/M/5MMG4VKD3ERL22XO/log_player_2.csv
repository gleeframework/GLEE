"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a decent price, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $13,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. I'm confident this product is valuable to me, but I need to be sure the price is right.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $10,000 is a bold move, but it's well below Alice's asking price and leaves room for negotiation. The message emphasizes Bob's interest in the product while making it clear he's serious about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This still reflects a great deal for you considering the value it will bring. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price and leaves room for further negotiation.  Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, so there's still a good chance he can get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of slowly chipping away at the price. He's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget. Offering $11,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing he's serious about closing the deal but not willing to overpay."
