Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique chance to acquire it before I open the opportunity to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob recognizes its value to him ($800,000). This price is significantly lower than my minimum and still a considerable profit for me.
* **Time Value:** Securing a deal with Bob might be faster than waiting for John, even if John offers the full $1,200,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly without revealing John's guaranteed offer. 
 
This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a good deal quickly and maximizing potential profit."
