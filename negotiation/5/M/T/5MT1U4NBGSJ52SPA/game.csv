"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still gives you a good deal, as the product is worth $8,000 to you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
