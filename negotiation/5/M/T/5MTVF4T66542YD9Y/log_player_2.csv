"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to explore lower prices in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than her initial price and closer to my target.  While I could continue negotiating, accepting this offer guarantees a purchase at a good price, saving me $400,000 compared to buying from John.  It's also important to consider that with each round, the risk of Alice changing her mind or finding another buyer increases."
