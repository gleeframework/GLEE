"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
