"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,500.  This is a great deal considering what you could gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or go with John's offer as a backup."
