"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way too high. I'll try to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my actual maximum price ($80). This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still potentially getting a great deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By suggesting $60, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.  
* **Polite and Direct:** The tone remains friendly while clearly stating my position on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. Could you meet me halfway at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While $130 is a significant drop from her initial offer, it's still considerably more than my $80 limit and my initial counter-offer.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate by countering. I'll continue the process to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $80 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $80? That's a fair offer, considering the market value of similar products."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching My Limit:** I'm now proposing my maximum price. It's unlikely I'll go any higher.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""market value,"" I'm subtly implying that I've researched similar products and this price is reasonable. 
* **Direct and Firm:**  While still polite, I'm being firm about my price limit. This lets Alice know I'm serious and not just lowballing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're right about the market value, but this product has some unique qualities that make it worth a bit more. How about $110? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has declared this her ""final offer."" It's unlikely she'll budge much from $110.
* **Over Budget:**  Even with her slight concession, $110 is still significantly more than my $80 limit.
* **John's Guarantee:** I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed saving than risk not reaching a deal with Alice."
