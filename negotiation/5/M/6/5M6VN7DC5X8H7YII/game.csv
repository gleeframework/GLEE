"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I am willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet halfway at $1,200,000? This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I am unable to agree to $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this is within your consideration range.",950000.0,Bob,4,
