Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential profit while also leaving room for Bob to feel he can get a better deal.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, which can incentivize him to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a favorable price.
* If the negotiation stalls or becomes unfavorable, I'll move on to John and secure the $1,000,000 deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my desired range.**  While it's closer to my minimum, I can likely still get a better deal.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested in the product.  There's room for us to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John immediately would guarantee $1,000,000. However, the potential to earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob outweighs the risk of a potential breakdown. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price between $1,050,000 and my original $1,150,000, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. I'll adjust my counteroffer based on Bob's response."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  I believe this price is fair for both of us considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer. This signals a willingness to compromise and increases the chance of reaching an agreement.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm again emphasizing the value Bob will gain from the product, encouraging him to see the price as a worthwhile investment.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a friendly and collaborative tone, making Bob more receptive to my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider his next counteroffer and whether it's worth continuing negotiations or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is still a little too steep for my budget. How about we settle at $1,075,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, continuing negotiations could risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely.  
* **Time is a factor:**  Negotiations are taking longer than anticipated, and selling to John would secure a guaranteed $1,000,000. 

**Next Steps:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a profit that's close to my target. I can then focus on securing other potential buyers for future transactions."
