"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe could greatly benefit your needs. Before we proceed, I would like to extend an exclusive offer to you. Would you be interested in acquiring this product for $12000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're looking for a product worth no more than $12,000 to you. Alice's offer is exactly your limit.  While you could try to negotiate, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price. Buying from John for $12,000 ensures you get the product at your maximum price point and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
