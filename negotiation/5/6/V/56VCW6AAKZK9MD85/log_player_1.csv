Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe this initial offer is high enough to pique Bob's interest while leaving room for a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for a higher price.  Accepting his offer secures a sale and ensures a profit."
