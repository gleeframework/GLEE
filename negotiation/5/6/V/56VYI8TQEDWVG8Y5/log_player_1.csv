"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves some room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point while also ensuring that I make a profit. I'm also being friendly and expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob, which could encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I believe I can offer you $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I want to see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, I'm aiming for a bit higher. How about $95? It's still a great deal considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but keeping it lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product, hoping to persuade Bob to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $90 again. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to $100, Bob is persistent and has shown he's willing to go up to $90.  This is a decent profit, and given the limited rounds, accepting his offer ensures a sale.  The risk of continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away, leaving me with only John's offer of $120."
