"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,600,000.  This price still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go up to $1,200,000. I think that's a fair price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough. It's important for me to get a fair price for this valuable product. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
