,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for a product of this quality. Let's try to make this work.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $105. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $98. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up. However, $98 is still a bit below my minimum. Let's split the difference and settle on $101. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",101.0,Alice,7,
