Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,999, which is a very competitive price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Aiming for the highest possible price that Bob might accept allows Alice to maximize her potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, the phrasing suggests a willingness to discuss the price, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable deal.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out."
