"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $180, hoping to maximize my potential profit.  While Bob values the product at $120, I'm confident I can negotiate a price closer to my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer at $160. This is still above my minimum of $150 and hopefully will be enticing enough for Bob to accept while still leaving some room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $145 is very close to my minimum of $150, and with only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether. Accepting this offer secures a profit for me and avoids the potential of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price."
