"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
