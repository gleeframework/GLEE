Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still reflects the product's true worth and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to see some more movement from your end."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
