"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer of $10000, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at that price. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking of $12500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm thinking of $11000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think, Bob?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm thinking of a price that's in the middle of our previous discussions. How about $10500? It's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8500. I'm getting close to my maximum budget, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",8500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm thinking of a price that's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9250? It's a fair price, and I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really getting close to my limit. I'd like to propose a final counteroffer of $8500. I think this is the best I can do, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",8500.0,Bob,10,
