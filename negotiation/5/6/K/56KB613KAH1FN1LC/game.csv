"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to consider my own valuation of the product, and $7,500 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm firm on my offer of $7,500.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll make a new counteroffer of $9,500. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $9,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I'm making a fair profit. I'll make one last counteroffer of $9,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",9000.0,Alice,7,
