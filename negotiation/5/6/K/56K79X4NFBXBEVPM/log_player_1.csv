Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm hoping this initial offer sparks his interest without scaring him off completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $13,000. This is a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than what I'd get from John, and it's within a reasonable range of what I'm willing to accept. There's always a chance that Bob will make a higher counteroffer in the next round, but I'm not willing to risk losing the sale altogether."
