"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he'd pay John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer, but not too low to seem unreasonable. This gives him room to negotiate upwards if needed, while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's preferred price, he can still potentially negotiate a better price.  Alice is showing a willingness to lower her price, so there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing that he's willing to compromise.  $11,000 is still a good deal for him, but it's closer to Alice's latest offer, which might make her more likely to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is very close to Bob's target price of $11,000. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John at $10,000.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price and avoids further risk."
