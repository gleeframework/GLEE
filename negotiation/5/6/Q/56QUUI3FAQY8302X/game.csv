"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to come down to that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, the product is worth more than $80 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $110 to feel good about the sale. How about $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not ready to go all the way down to $95. I'm willing to come down another $5, but I need to make at least $100 to feel good about the sale. How about $100?",100.0,Alice,5,
