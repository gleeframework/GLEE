"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I'm interested in the product,  I'm only willing to pay $1,300,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope you'll consider it.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm motivated to sell, $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
