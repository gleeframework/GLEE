"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $19000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $19000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $18000? ",18000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $18000. I can offer you a compromise at $19500, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. Let me know if you're interested!",19500.0,Alice,5,
