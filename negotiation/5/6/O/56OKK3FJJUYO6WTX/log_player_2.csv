Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to $750,000? I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you value the product at $1,000,000, so how about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $875,000.  This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to achieve a fair price for my product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.
