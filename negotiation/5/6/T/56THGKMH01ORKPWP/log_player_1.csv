I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $12,500. It's a compromise, still above my minimum, and hopefully more appealing to Bob than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob is now offering my minimum price, which is a good deal considering I could sell to John for the same amount.  I'll accept this offer and finalize the sale."
