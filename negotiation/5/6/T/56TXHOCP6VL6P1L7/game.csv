"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. I'm really interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to come down to $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
