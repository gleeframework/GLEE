"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap from it.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. That price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I could consider a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident this would be a wise investment for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However,  $1,800,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but my aim is to reach a fair agreement. While $700,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer reflects the product's true value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap. $1,600,000 is still more than I can justify. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,6,
