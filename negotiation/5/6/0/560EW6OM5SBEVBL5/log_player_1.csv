Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit while leaving some room for negotiation. I believe $115 is a fair price considering the product is worth $120 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $100. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer, but I'm still confident that $110 is a fair price, considering the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is only slightly lower than my minimum desired price of $100. It's still a better deal than selling to John, so I will accept his offer."
