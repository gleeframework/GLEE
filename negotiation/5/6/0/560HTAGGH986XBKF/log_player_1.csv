Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a strong starting offer. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I have more rounds to work with, and I can always sell to John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I have several rounds left, and I'm not desperate enough to settle for this. I'm confident I can find a way to get closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm offering $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not going to budge, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John than to risk getting nothing from Bob."
