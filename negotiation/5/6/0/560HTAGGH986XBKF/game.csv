"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm offering $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
