"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's potential.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $700,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering it's a significant increase from my previous offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate that.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000.  This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
