Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This seems like a fair deal for both of us.

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go above his perceived value of $800,000. While we could try to negotiate further, John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which is a significant profit over Bob's current offer and ensures we don't lose out by continuing a potentially fruitless negotiation."
