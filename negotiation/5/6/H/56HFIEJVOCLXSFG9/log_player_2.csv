"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum price, so rejecting the offer is the best initial move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,150,000 is simply too far below the product's value. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,250,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for some flexibility on my end. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price.  While Alice's offer is closer to his target, it's still higher than his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,200,000?  This would be a fair price for me and allows you to move the product quickly."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
