"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see and allows for some room for negotiation.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this price point reflects the unique benefits it offers and leaves us both with a fair deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
