"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really like it! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still below what I believe John would offer. This gives Bob a chance to negotiate, while still allowing me to potentially earn more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum price. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $80 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120?  This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's split the difference - how about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price and I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $100 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This is a good deal for both of us and lets us close the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a good compromise and lets us close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. It's getting close to the point where John's offer might be the best option, but I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This would allow us both to get a good deal and finally close this sale."", ""product_price"": 105}
