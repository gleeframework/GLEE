"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I must be honest, $1,050,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but my offer is already a significant compromise. This product is worth a lot to me, both in terms of its inherent value and its potential.  I can budge a little further, but this is my final offer -  $1,075,000.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,075,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd like to make a final offer at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
