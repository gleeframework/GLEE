Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,075,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd like to make a final offer at this price.

```

**Reasoning:** Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge beyond $1,050,000.  While continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price from Bob, it's unlikely to be significantly more. Accepting John's offer of $1,200,000 guarantees the maximum profit and avoids the risk of a stalemate with Bob."
