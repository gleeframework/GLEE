"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm and the value you see in this product, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  To start the negotiation, I'm offering $850000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point given my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I believe the product holds.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs.  I believe it's a solid starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I still need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $1000000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1025000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
