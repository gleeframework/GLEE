Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm and the value you see in this product, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  To start the negotiation, I'm offering $850000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point given my budget.
