"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if I can get a lower price, closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, aiming to bring the price closer to my target. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $85 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my ideal price. There's no point in further negotiation or going to John, as I won't get a better deal."
