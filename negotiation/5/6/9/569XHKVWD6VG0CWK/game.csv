"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $90 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $75? That would work much better for me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $85. It's a good price, and I think you'll really like the product. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
