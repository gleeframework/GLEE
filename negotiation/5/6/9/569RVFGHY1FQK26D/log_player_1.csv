Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find common ground and close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob is stubbornly low-balling me.  I've already lost a couple of rounds, and I risk getting stuck in a downward price spiral.  Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price and avoids further negotiation risk."
