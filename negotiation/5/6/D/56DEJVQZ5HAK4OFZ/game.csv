"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $105. ",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $110, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that's normally worth $20. That brings the effective price down to $90. I think that's a fair compromise.",90.0,Alice,5,
