# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and it's still significantly less than what I could get from another buyer.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's less than what she could get elsewhere, it's still above your maximum budget. You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is within your price range."
