**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $10,000. This is a strong opening position, clearly stating my limit and showing Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. It's also a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, prompting Alice to consider a compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Although we're getting closer, we only have three rounds left. Given the diminishing chances of getting Alice to come down to my budget, I'm choosing to buy the product from John.  This ensures I get the product at my desired price point and saves me further time and negotiation efforts."
