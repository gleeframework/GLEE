Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is less than Bob's perceived value of $15,000 but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get closer to his valuation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer and engage in the negotiation.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects this initial offer, but I also have a backup plan with John. This strategy allows me to maximize my chances of achieving a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $13,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still potential to get closer to my initial offer of $14,000. He's already shown interest and acknowledges the value of the product. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain some leverage in the negotiation and potentially drive a better deal for myself.

I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $13,000 is close, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm suggesting a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $13,000 and my previous offer of $14,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize that this price is fair and beneficial to both of us, reinforcing the idea that we're working towards a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a friendly and productive negotiation."
