Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential benefits of the deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, which is likely to happen."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $8,500 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **More negotiation is possible:** I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  
* **Selling to John is a backup:** I'm not desperate. I can always sell to John for $12,000 if I don't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive and reasonable tone:** I'm being respectful and explaining my reasoning for the counteroffer.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,250 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $9,000.  This is my best offer, as I can buy it elsewhere for $8,000. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.
* **Potential for better deal:** I have 6 rounds left and believe I can still push for a higher price.
* **John is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $12,000 if I don't reach a deal with Bob that meets my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm proposing a small increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
