"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,250 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $9,000.  This is my best offer, as I can buy it elsewhere for $8,000. Let's see if we can make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $9,100? I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last bit.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. Would you consider $8,900? It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal. ",8900.0,Bob,6,
