Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially a profitable outcome for both of us. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $11,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above his offer. I'm hoping this will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant loss for me compared to selling to John for $15,000.  I'm going to take the guaranteed profit and sell to John."
