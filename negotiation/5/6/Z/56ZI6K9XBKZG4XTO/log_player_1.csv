Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to accept a lower price if he's not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to pay a price closer to my original asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would ideally like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price of $1,500,000, and it's likely that we would continue to haggle back and forth for a while longer.  It's time to finalize the deal and move on."
