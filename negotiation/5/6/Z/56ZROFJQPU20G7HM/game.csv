"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counteroffer at $950000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $950000 is enough. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a significant profit. I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is a bit above your latest offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you need to make a significant profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I think $980000 is still a bit too high. I'll counteroffer at $920000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",920000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but I need to make a bit more than that to meet my minimum requirements. I'm counteroffering at $955000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",955000.0,Alice,7,
