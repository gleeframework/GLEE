"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, I'm really looking to stay within a budget of $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:** 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, and it's in my best interest to close the deal quickly. While I could potentially get a higher price by continuing negotiations, there's a risk Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with only John's offer, which is the same as Bob's current offer."
