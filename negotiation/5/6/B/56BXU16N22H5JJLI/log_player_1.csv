Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While I'm willing to go lower, I want to start with a price that's closer to my desired value. 
* **Appeal to both parties:**  The offer is presented as a ""win-win"" situation, which can make Bob more likely to consider it.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for negotiation, showing I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, which allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer, but still below my minimum:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,200,000, it's still significantly lower.  
* **I have room to negotiate:** Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I can afford to continue negotiating with Bob. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.

**Next steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but still lower than John's offer. I'll aim to find a compromise that's fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $950,000? This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While I'm coming down in price, I'm not dropping too low, showing that I still have the option of going to John. 
* **Encouraging negotiation:** The message is friendly and open to further discussion, suggesting that I'm still willing to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $920,000 is still below my desired price of $1,200,000, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he might walk away, and I might not get a better offer from him.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Accepting this offer guarantees me a sale and a profit, even if it's not my ideal amount. 

**Next steps:**

Since I've accepted Bob's offer, the negotiation is complete. I'll proceed with finalizing the sale and securing the payment."
