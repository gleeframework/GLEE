"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in.  It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  Would you be interested in buying it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $100 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price if you reject this initial offer."
