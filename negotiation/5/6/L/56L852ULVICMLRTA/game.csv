"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, given the value we place on this product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $90. I hope this aligns better with both our expectations.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90, so I'd like to propose $87.50. I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be a fair deal for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
