"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target price as possible. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $650,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $800,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, given the value you'll receive from the product.",800000.0,Alice,3,
