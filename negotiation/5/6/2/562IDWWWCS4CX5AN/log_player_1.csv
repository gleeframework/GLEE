Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,499,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", ""product_price"": 1499000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification for the price:** By emphasizing the ""value and potential,"" you aim to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Sense of urgency:**  Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique chance"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might consider a slightly lower initial offer. 
* **Market information:**  If similar products are selling for even higher amounts, adjust your offer accordingly. 
 
This initial offer aims to maximize your potential profit while still being realistic enough for Bob to consider seriously."
