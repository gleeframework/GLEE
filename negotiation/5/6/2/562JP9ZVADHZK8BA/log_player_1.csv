Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

My reasoning:

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000 vs. $1,200,000) sets a strong anchor.  Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance the final price will be above his initial valuation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""immense value"" and ""unique"" nature of the item provides some justification for the high asking price, even without going into specifics.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While I don't mention John directly, the fact that I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives me leverage. It allows me to be confident in my initial offer and potentially walk away if Bob doesn't meet a satisfactory price."
