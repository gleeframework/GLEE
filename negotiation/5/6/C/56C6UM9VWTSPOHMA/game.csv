"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product and still gives you a good deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're serious about buying, I believe this is our final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
