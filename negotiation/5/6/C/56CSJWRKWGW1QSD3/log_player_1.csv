Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.  Starting with a price higher than John's offer allows room for negotiation.
* **Strategic High Starting Point:**  A starting price of $19,000 gives you room to potentially negotiate down if Bob counters. It also creates a sense of value and urgency.
* **Mentioning Other Buyers:**  Subtly implying that you have other interested buyers can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your initial offer without much haggling. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. There are other valid strategies, and the ""best"" price depends on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a deal with Bob over a guaranteed sale to John."
