"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. Can you consider that?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm going to make a counteroffer to $82.50. This is the lowest price I'm willing to sell the product for. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice! However, $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $80 for the product. Can you consider that?",80.0,Bob,4,
