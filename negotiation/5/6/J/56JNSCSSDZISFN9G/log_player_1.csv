Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and willing to negotiate. We're still significantly above our minimum sale price, so there's room to negotiate further and aim for a higher price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $890,000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?

You have three options:

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While we could push for a bit more, Bob is consistently coming up in price and we're now at $880,000.  This is a very strong profit margin ($80,000 above our minimum) and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
