While Alice is getting closer to my target price, it's still above my budget.  We're down to the final round, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product from John for a lower price.  It's a tough decision, but given the limited time and the risk of not finding another seller, I'm going to buy the product from John.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the potential for further negotiation with Alice that might not be fruitful."
