"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $925,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, I'm confident you'll find this price to be fair.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $915,000. This is my last offer. If you're willing to accept, I'll make it happen.",915000.0,Bob,6,
