"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better deal.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is a better deal than John's $12,000. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, it's unlikely he'll get it down to his desired $10,500. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets a good deal while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
