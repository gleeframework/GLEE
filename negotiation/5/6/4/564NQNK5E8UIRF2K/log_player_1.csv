Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned it has. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $9,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'm open to selling it to you for $10,500. This reflects its value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my minimum price, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield much more.  I'm willing to accept this offer and move on."
