The product is worth $150 to me, and Alice is offering it for $180. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $135 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's worth $150 to me and $150 to Alice. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $160 is closer to my value, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}

I'm willing to go up to $145. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Alice will see it that way."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155

Alice's offer of $155 is only $5 less than John's offer. It's not worth risking further negotiation when I can buy the product from John for a guaranteed $150."
