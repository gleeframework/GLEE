"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $750,000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference - how about $850,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
