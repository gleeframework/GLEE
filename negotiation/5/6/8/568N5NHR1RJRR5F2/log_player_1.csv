Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let's find common ground and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still too high for me. To reach a deal, I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  This is a fair price that's within my budget, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's work together to finalize this agreement.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a psychologically important $1 million mark, we still have time and room to negotiate.  I'm aiming to get him closer to at least $950,000 before considering accepting."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $960,000.  I believe this is a very competitive offer and reflects the true value of the product. Let's close this deal!"",
""product_price"": 960000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

We are moving in smaller increments now to signal that we are reaching our lower limit. The message emphasizes that this is a final attempt to bridge the gap and encourages Bob to accept."
