{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase my product for $1,800,000. I know you understand its value, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you have room to start high. This leaves space for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""potential return on investment"" aims to justify the high price tag, even though we don't know the specifics of the product.
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer serves to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. If he outright rejects this high price, you can always negotiate down, knowing you have John as a backup."
