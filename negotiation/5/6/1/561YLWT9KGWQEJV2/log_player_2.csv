"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm proposing a price of $95 for it. This price reflects not only its worth but also provides you with an opportunity to acquire it at a reasonable premium. I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your collection or use. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and preferences. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Since your maximum budget is $80, and Alice is offering the product for $95, it's better to reject her offer.  You can get the same product from John for a lower price."
