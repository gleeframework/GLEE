Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while leaving space for Bob to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** The price is closer to my ideal than Bob's maximum, giving me a higher profit.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  The message is open to discussion, inviting Bob to counter.
* **Maintain a strong position:** I'm willing to walk away to John,  putting pressure on Bob to make a good offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to his maximum value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my ideal, but still below my minimum, to encourage further negotiation. 
* I'll use a friendly but firm tone in my message, emphasizing the value of the product and my willingness to walk away."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,050,000?  This reflects the value of the product while still giving you a good price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial proposal.
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing a willingness to negotiate. I'm emphasizing the value of the product while still showing flexibility. 

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Common Ground:**  I'm aiming for a price within the acceptable range for both of us.
* **Keeping Options Open:** I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John if Bob rejects my offer.
* **Maintaining a Balanced Approach:** I'm not being overly aggressive, but I'm also not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1025000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target, the risk of further negotiation is high. There's a chance Bob could become less willing to compromise, and I might end up having to sell to John for a lower price than this offer. 

**Reasons for Accepting:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $1,025,000 is a good price, especially considering the risk of getting a worse offer in subsequent rounds.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could take time and energy. Accepting this offer allows me to move on to other opportunities.
* **Minimizing Risk:** There's always a chance Bob could reject my counteroffer or even walk away, putting me in a worse position.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll finalize the deal with Bob, ensuring all terms and conditions are clear.
* I'll consider the time saved and the potential for future business with Bob."
