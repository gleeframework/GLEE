Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We're pleased to continue our discussion. In light of our previous negotiations, we propose a counteroffer of $1,112,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in the 7th round, and while I'd still prefer a lower price, Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired range. It's getting risky to keep pushing for a lower price, and I risk losing the deal altogether or having to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's time to accept the offer and close the deal."
