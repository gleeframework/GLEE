"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above her own valuation of the product. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a good price for Bob. This is a reasonable compromise, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's still within Bob's budget."
