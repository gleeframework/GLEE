"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,
