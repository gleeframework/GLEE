"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. $110 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to go up to $90. This is my final offer.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $100 for the product.  This price reflects its value and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
