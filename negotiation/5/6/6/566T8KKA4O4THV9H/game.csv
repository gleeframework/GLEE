"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This feels like a fair price considering its value to both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $11,750, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $11,250, which is a fair midpoint between our last offers. Let's try to close this deal quickly.",11250.0,Bob,4,
