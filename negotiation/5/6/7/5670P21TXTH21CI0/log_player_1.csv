Round 2
Bob's offer:

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While I could continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000).  Continuing to push for more risks:

* **Bob walking away:** He's stated this is his final offer, and there's no guarantee he'll budge further.
* **Wasting time/opportunity cost:**  Every round spent on this negotiation is time I could be using to find another buyer if a better deal is possible.

Taking the $1,900,000 now secures a substantial profit and avoids the risks of further negotiation."
