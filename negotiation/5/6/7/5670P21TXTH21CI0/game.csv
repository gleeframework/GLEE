"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $2,300,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. How about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,800,000 falls short of what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $2,050,000? This reflects the product's true value and allows me to feel good about the deal.",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your proposal. I've considered your offer carefully, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. Based on my budget and the current market situation, I think $1,950,000 would be a fair price for both of us.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. It seems we're getting closer. While $1,950,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher number. To be done with this negotiation, how about we agree on $2,000,000 even?  This is my final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a final offer of $1,900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
