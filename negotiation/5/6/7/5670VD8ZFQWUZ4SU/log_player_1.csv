"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value, but leaves space for him to make a counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and open to discussion. I want to build a positive rapport with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm aware of John's offer and will use it as a reference point during the negotiation.
* **Bob's Counteroffers:** I will carefully consider Bob's counteroffers and evaluate whether they are acceptable or whether I should make a counter-counteroffer.
* **Time Limit:**  I'm mindful of the 10-round limit and will adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I believe I can still get closer to my target price with further negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:** I am keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices.  I need to be strategic, considering Bob's budget constraints and my own minimum acceptable price.
* I will continue to monitor John's offer as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price for a product of this value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, but still maintains a comfortable distance from my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Demonstrating Flexibility:** This shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Focus on Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value, subtly implying that $950,000 is still a good deal. 

**Strategy:**

* **Assessing Bob's Response:** I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he accepts, I have a successful deal. If he rejects, I need to consider my next move, keeping John's offer in mind.
* **Potential Counter-Counteroffers:**  I am prepared for Bob to make another counteroffer. I will adjust my strategy based on his proposal, considering how much further I'm willing to go down in price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm getting closer to my comfort zone. How about $920,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's getting closer, it's not yet a deal I'm comfortable with. 
* **Room for Improvement:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer just yet.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price while remaining open to a compromise.  I will carefully consider Bob's budget constraints and the remaining rounds.
* **Monitoring John's Offer:**  I will continue to use John's offer as a reference point throughout the negotiation process."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $925,000. We've both been flexible, and this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:**  I'm reaching my final stand, offering a price that is only $10,000 below my previous offer. This demonstrates that I'm serious about reaching a deal but have a firm bottom line.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob that this is still a good deal for him.
* **Urgency:**  I add a sense of urgency by suggesting that we ""make this deal happen"" to encourage Bob to accept.

* **John's Offer:** I'm still aware of John's offer and will use it as a reference point in my decision-making.
