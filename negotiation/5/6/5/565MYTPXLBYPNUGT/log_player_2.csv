"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely do better.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your initial proposal. However, I'm looking to invest a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value we both see in it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction. Offering $850,000 is a good starting point for his counteroffer, as it's a substantial decrease from Alice's initial offer.  This allows for some wiggle room in future negotiations, as Bob is willing to pay more than Alice's minimum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go below $875,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, Bob can likely still negotiate for a better price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a price closer to his desired target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $875,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects our mutual benefit.  I'm ready to go to $860,000. This is a fair offer that allows for both of us to walk away with a win.  Let's see if we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still pushing for a lower price, but he's starting to show a willingness to compromise. By offering $860,000, he's demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement while still maintaining a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  This counteroffer is a strong move as it's within the range of potential value for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $880,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's true value. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is a good deal for Bob. He's already achieved a significant discount from her initial offer of $900,000.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice becoming less willing to compromise or the negotiation dragging on. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a favorable price and avoids potentially higher costs or the need to buy from John."
