"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you being flexible. However,  $14000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13000? It's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,
