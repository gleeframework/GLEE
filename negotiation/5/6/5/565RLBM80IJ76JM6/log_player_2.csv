Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a very fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it. Let's close this deal!

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are shrinking, and there's a risk Alice might not budge much more. Accepting at $825,000 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at the higher price."
