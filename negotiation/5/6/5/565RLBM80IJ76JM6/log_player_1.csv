Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Message:** This message is friendly and direct, highlighting the potential benefit for Bob. It also avoids putting pressure on him to accept immediately. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a high offer, I aim to:

*  **Secure a better price:** Ideally, Bob will accept the offer without much haggling. 
* **Position myself for a strong negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can still potentially negotiate a price closer to my desired value.
* **Give myself an exit strategy:**  If the negotiation stalls or becomes too difficult, I can always fall back on the $800,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, I'm not willing to compromise my minimum value. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value. This will allow me to continue negotiations while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground so we can both be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$850,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while also protecting my minimum value.
* **Message:**  The message remains friendly and emphasizes the potential for a win-win situation. It also avoids being overly aggressive or confrontational.

**Strategy:**

By offering a lower price while still staying above my minimum, I hope to:

* **Show flexibility and willingness to negotiate:** This could encourage Bob to come up on his offer.
* **Maintain my leverage:**  I still have the option to accept John's offer if Bob doesn't agree to a higher price.

I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still finding it hard to justify that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's still not quite there. I'm not willing to sell below my minimum value, even if it means continuing the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'm confident that I can still get a better price from Bob. I will counter his offer with a slightly higher price, but I will remain firm in my minimum value. I will also keep John's offer in mind as a backup option."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a very fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$825,000:** This counteroffer is a small compromise from my previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Message:** This message is direct and conveys a sense of urgency, pushing Bob to make a decision. It emphasizes the fairness of the offer and the potential for a quick resolution. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** A small concession can encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still not at my minimum, giving me room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Create a sense of finality:** The message suggests that this might be my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be the tipping point for Bob to accept and close the deal. However, I'm prepared to continue negotiations or accept John's offer if necessary."
