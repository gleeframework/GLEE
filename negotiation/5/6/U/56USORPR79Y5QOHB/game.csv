"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I'm thinking of a price of $120 for it. Is this something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a profit. I can do $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $90, so I'm thinking $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's meet in the middle again",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise at $102.50. Can you consider that?",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $107.50, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again",107.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I'm willing to make one last offer. I can do $102. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Please let me know if you can meet me at this price.",102.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've gone as low as I can, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $108, but that's it. I'm not willing to go any lower than that",108.0,Alice,9,
