"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your proposal of $750000. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me.",825000.0,Alice,3,
