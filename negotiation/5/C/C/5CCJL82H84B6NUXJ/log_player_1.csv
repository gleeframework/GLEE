"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,800,000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000. This sets a strong initial point and allows for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the ""rare opportunity"" and ""true value"" of the product to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room to negotiate. I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1800000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for your product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** While Bob's initial counteroffer is unacceptable, I'm not giving up on the negotiation. There's still room to find a middle ground. 
* **Seeking a Better Deal:** I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value. I'm confident I can secure a better deal than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000 to show my commitment to making this deal work. This price is still fair considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with $1,500,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Value:** I remind Bob of the ""product's value"" to justify the price and encourage him to consider my offer seriously.
* **Seeking a Compromise:** I express my willingness to ""find a solution"" that benefits both of us, highlighting my desire for a mutually beneficial deal.

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still protecting my minimum acceptable profit. It's a step towards finding common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1500000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1200000. This is a significant jump from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of your product while remaining within my budget. Let's make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid further negotiations.
* **Minimizing Risk:** There's no guarantee that further negotiations with Bob will result in a higher price, and I risk losing valuable time and potentially missing out on the deal altogether.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing negotiations has the potential to drag on, and I could lose out on opportunities to sell the product to other buyers. Accepting this offer is the most efficient way to secure a satisfactory profit.

Selling to Bob for $1,200,000 is a good outcome given my minimum price and the time constraints of the negotiation."
