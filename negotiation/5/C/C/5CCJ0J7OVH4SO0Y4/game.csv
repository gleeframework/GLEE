"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this product has great value, but I'm not willing to pay top dollar for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While $700,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet closer to the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $900,000, which would be $850,000. Can we consider that?",850000.0,Bob,4,
