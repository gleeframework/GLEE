"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000 for it. This is my maximum, as I can always buy from John for that price. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1400000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
