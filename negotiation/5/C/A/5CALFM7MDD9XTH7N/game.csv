"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $100? I'm really interested in this product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $125 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still negotiating, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $122. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",122.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility,  $122 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $115? That seems like a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $122 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $118. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",118.0,Alice,7,
