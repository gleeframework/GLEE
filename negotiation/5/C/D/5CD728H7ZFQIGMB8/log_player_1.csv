Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's valuation, but it gives him room to negotiate without you immediately losing out to John.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100. This is still above Bob's valuation but closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer for Bob, but if not, I'm prepared to go another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $95 isn't my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum threshold of $120. I'm going to accept Bob's offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and a potential counteroffer from Bob that might be even lower."
