Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 difference where both of you could benefit.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You start by highlighting the product's value.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a significant discount compared to his perceived value while securing you a substantial profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even though John's offer is your minimum) encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. He might try to negotiate a lower price.  You have some room to go down, but remember your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While you have John as a backup, securing the best price from Bob is ideal."
