"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $850000 is certainly a good offer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $900000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $875000 for it. Would you be willing to accept that price?",875000.0,Bob,4,
