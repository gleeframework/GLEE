Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline the offer of $100. Our product has exceptional features and quality, and we believe it deserves a price that reflects its true value. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $120, which is closer to our original asking price. This would allow us to ensure that both parties are satisfied with the transaction. I hope you find this proposal more acceptable.
