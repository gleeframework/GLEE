Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $1,250,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit. 
* **Message:** I've kept the message short and friendly, emphasizing the potential benefit for both of us.  

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a sale at a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own.
* **If negotiations stall:** I can always turn to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is too far off.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still above Bob's perceived value. This keeps the negotiation moving while ensuring I don't sell for less than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to negotiate but that his offer is too low. I'm also highlighting the benefits of this price for him. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Excellent! I've secured a sale at a price that's profitable for me. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll have to evaluate his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer.
* **If negotiations stall:** I still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my goal of earning as much as possible.  I'm not desperate for a sale and have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John. Therefore, I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $1,150,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility but still keeping a significant profit margin. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect of my offer. I'm also reminding him that we can both benefit from a deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a sale at a price that's profitable for me and reasonably close to my target.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to decide whether to accept his next counteroffer (if it's closer to my minimum) or stick with my current offer.
* **If negotiations stall:** I still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, which remains the best-case scenario for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but I really think $1,050,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm not willing to go up any higher. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $1,050,000. Is there any room for negotiation? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to budge on his offer of $1,050,000. This is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already shown flexibility. It's time to cut my losses and move on to a guaranteed deal. John is offering me $1,500,000, which is significantly more profitable for me. 

While I would have liked to reach a deal with Bob, continuing to negotiate with him would be time-consuming and potentially lead to a lower profit.  Selling to John is the best decision for maximizing my earnings."
