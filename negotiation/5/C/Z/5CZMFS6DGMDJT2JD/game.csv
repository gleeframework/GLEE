"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit shy of $825,000. How about we meet in the middle at $787,500? I'm confident that's a fair price for this product.",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $787,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product and the time we've spent negotiating, I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $800,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we meet exactly at $800,000? I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I need to make sure it's a fair one for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
