Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However,  $2,300,000 is quite high. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a more reasonable starting point.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 6

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, he's still significantly under the $1,500,000 John is willing to pay.  At this point, the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed profit."
