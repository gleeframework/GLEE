{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $120? This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth more to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $112 is very close to my ideal price point.  While I'd prefer a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit for me."
