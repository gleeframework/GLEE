"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $1,100,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price for a valuable piece like this.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $950,000?  This price still reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  How about $900,000? This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your budget. Let's try to close this deal, it's a win-win situation for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $900,000, so how about $875,000? I think that's a fair price for a valuable product like this.",875000.0,Bob,6,
