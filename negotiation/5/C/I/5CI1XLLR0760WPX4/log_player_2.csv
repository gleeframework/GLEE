Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which I believe is a fair value considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I could buy it from John for less."", ""product_price"": 8500}
