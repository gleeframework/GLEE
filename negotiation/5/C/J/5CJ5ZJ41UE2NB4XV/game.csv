"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is very interesting to me, but I had a slightly lower price point in mind. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
