Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.
