{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $850,000, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'd like to propose $787500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John is still an option, but I'm not ready to give up on a better deal with Bob yet.  I'll counteroffer one more time before considering John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. $787,500 is still a little below what I need. Let's compromise one last time. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
