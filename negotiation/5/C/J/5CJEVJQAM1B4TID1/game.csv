"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $850000, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $825000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal. ",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'd like to propose $787500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can agree on a price.",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $787500 is still a little below what I need. Let's compromise one last time. I'm willing to come down to $800000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. ",800000.0,Alice,5,
