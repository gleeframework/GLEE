"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $130. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's really my limit. What do you say?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $110, but I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $125? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a good middle ground. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget.  $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both of us.",117.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $117.50 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise to get closer to your target price. How about we meet at $122? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",122.0,Alice,7,
