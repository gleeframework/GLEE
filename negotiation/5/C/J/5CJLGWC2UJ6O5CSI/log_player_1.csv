Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its exceptional value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""exceptional value"" are used to create a sense of scarcity and desirability. By explicitly mentioning that you believe the price is fair, you aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price, still exceeding your minimum.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while considering Bob's valuation of the product."
