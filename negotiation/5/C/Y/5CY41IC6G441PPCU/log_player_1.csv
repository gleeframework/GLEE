Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is genuinely interested.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and conversational tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to sway him towards acceptance.

**Strategy:**

This opening offer allows me to assess Bob's interest and his willingness to negotiate. It also sets a clear price range for the negotiation. I'm prepared to lower my price slightly if necessary, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1300000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my target. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything less than $1,350,000 at this point. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a quick sale. This allows me to maintain leverage and potentially push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm comfortable with $1,350,000. That's still a fair price for you, considering the product's value, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by highlighting the product's value to Bob.
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly emphasizing the need for a quick decision to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping to find a middle ground.  This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a price that's acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1350000 is still out of my budget. I'd like to make a more substantial counteroffer. How about we meet at $1150000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,350,000.  There's a large gap between our expectations, and I'm not confident that further negotiation will bridge the difference.  I'm unwilling to risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a deal that's significantly below my desired price.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and allows me to avoid further negotiation.  While I would prefer a higher price, securing $1,500,000 is a safe and efficient outcome."
