"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $725,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $650,000 is a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you. I'm thinking of a price of $675,000. This is a bit higher than your offer, but I'm confident you'll see the value in the product. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
