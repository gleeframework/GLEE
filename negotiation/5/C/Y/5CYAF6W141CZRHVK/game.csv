"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but $700,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is my best offer, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to make a serious counteroffer.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. If you're serious about selling, let's find a way to close the gap.",850000.0,Bob,4,
