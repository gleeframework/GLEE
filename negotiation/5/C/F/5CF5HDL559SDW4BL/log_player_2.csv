"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and knows the product is worth less to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offering process and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $875,000, which is only $25,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob, considering the product's value to him is $1,000,000 and he has the option to buy from John for that price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while still saving a significant amount."
