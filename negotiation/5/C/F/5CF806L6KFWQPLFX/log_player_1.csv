Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good deal. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $145,  still above Bob's last offer but closer to his perceived value. I hope this will encourage him to accept."
