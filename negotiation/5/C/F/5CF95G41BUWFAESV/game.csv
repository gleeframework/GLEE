"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by previous customers. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it's worth more than what the market suggests. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is still a fair price considering the benefits I'm looking for.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that might better suit both of us. How about we aim for a price of $95 for the product? This is still above the average market price but below my initial asking price, aiming for a mutually beneficial transaction.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $90, which I believe is a fair compromise given the benefits I'm looking for in the product.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Considering your feedback, Bob, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $92 for the product? This is slightly above your last offer, yet still below my initial asking price. It reflects the value of the product and respects your budget constraints.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $92 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to pay $90 for the product, which I believe is fair to both of us.  Let's close the deal and move on.",90.0,Bob,6,
