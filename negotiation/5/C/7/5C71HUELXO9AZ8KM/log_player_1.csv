Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this item for $119. I believe you'll find it very valuable."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $119 is my initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate down a dollar or two. 
* **Secure a Higher Sale:** Offering it at $119 still gives me a significantly better profit than selling it to John for $100."
