"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it now.",100.0,Bob,4,
