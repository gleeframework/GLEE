"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is below my minimum price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is worth more than that to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finally close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  While her $11,500 offer is tempting, you can get the product for $12,000 from John with no further negotiation. It makes more sense to take the sure thing and save a little money."
