"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is below my minimum price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is worth more than that to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $12,500 is closer, but still a little steep for me.  Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finally close this deal!",11500.0,Alice,5,
