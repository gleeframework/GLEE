Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding our minimum ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a slight possibility of Bob countering with a higher offer, while still ensuring we get more than our minimum if he accepts outright.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120."
