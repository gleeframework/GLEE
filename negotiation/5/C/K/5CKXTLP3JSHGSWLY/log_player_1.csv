Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
