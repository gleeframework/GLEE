"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I'm interested, $180 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $95? That's a reasonable increase from my initial offer and puts us closer to a price point that works for me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $95, which would be $117.50. This is the best I can do, and I hope it's still acceptable to you.",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for sticking with this negotiation. I can tell we both want to make a deal happen. How about $100? That's my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $117.50. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. I'm confident that John is still interested in buying the product for $150, and I'd rather sell it to him at that price than compromise further.",117.5,Alice,7,
