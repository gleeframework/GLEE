Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90.  This gives Bob a little room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $70 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer at $75. This is still a bit above what Bob offered, but it's closer to his price point and might make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and I'm not sure how much more negotiation will get me. I'd rather secure a sale and avoid the risk of further rounds that could lead to a rejection or selling to John for a lower profit."
