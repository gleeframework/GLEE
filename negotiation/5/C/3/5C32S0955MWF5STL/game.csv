"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was thinking that $1200000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1200000. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1250000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1250000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and meet you at $1275000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to accept $1275000. I've already made concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'm not budging from there. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to come to an agreement at this price. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me at $1300000. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
