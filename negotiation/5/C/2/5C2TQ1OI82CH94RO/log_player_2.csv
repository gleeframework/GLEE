**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000). There's a lot of room for negotiation, so I'll reject her initial offer and try to get a better price."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a fair deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $725000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit high.  I'll reject it and continue negotiating to see if I can push her down further. There's still room for improvement before I consider buying from John."

# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $700000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price,  $700,000 is still too high.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get her down further. It's important to remember that I have a backup option with John, but I'm still determined to save as much money as possible."
