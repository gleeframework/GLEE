Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000** because I can sell it to John for that amount.
* **Bob values the product at $1,200,000**, so there is room for negotiation.
* **Offering $1,150,000** allows me to earn a significant profit beyond my minimum while potentially being attractive to Bob.

By offering a price closer to my minimum, I increase the chance of Bob accepting. However, by leaving some room for negotiation, I also avoid leaving too much money on the table if he does accept."
