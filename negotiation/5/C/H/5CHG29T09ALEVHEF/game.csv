"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's close this deal!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90. That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still below what I need.  How about $95?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the price. Let's make this happen!",95.0,Alice,5,
