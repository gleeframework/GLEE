"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is significantly higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for some potential negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90. That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that amount. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John for $150, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still below what I need.  How about $95?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
