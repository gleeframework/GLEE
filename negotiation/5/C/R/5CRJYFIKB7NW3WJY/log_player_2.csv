Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one last push to meet you in the middle. I'm going to meet you at $102.50. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point. While we could try to negotiate further, getting the price down another $2.50 isn't guaranteed and risks her walking away from the deal. Accepting at $102.50 ensures we get the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer."
