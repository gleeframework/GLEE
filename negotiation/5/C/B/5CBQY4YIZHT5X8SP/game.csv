"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate you considering me. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, though, and would be happy to purchase it for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $100 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,4,
