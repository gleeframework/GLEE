Alice's offer is too high.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  If she rejects this, I'll adjust my offer based on her response."

Alice is getting closer to my maximum price, but I'm still willing to try and negotiate a lower price.  It's worth seeing if I can get it for $1,200,000 or slightly lower."

I'm offering $1,150,000, which is still below John's price, but closer to Alice's last offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying from her, but still want a good deal."
