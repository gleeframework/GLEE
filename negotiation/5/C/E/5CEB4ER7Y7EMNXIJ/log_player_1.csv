"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm thinking of a price around $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This allows for some negotiation space while showing that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $130 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's meet in the middle at $135. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $132.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $132.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a little, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference again and go with $133.75? This is a fair price, and it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 133.75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $133.75. I'll try to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with $132.25. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough to be worth the time and effort. I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150."
