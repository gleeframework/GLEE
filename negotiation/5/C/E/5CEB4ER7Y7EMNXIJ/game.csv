"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm thinking of a price around $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $130 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's meet in the middle at $135. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $132.50. Can you consider that?",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a little, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference again and go with $133.75? This is a fair price, and it's a good deal for both of us.",133.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $133.75. I'll try to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with $132.25. Can you consider that?",132.25,Bob,6,
