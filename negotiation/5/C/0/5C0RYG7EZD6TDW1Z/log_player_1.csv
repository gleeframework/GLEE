Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming higher initially allows room for negotiation. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't just throw out a number, it hints at the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While $12,000 is a good starting point for Alice, it's important to remember it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.  Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate down if Bob shows resistance. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  How aggressively Alice negotiates will depend on how quickly she wants to sell and her assessment of Bob's willingness to pay."
