"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the product for closer to $800,000.  I believe this price is still fair considering the value it brings to my business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will stick to her price or even raise it again. Accepting this offer saves Bob $350,000 compared to buying from John."
