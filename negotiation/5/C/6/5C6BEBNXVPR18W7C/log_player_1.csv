Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation.  It leaves room for negotiation but still gives me a good starting point.  It also uses a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $7,500. Would you be willing to consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's my minimum acceptable price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and while I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing time and potentially getting a worse deal.  John is guaranteed to buy at my minimum price, so it's the safest and most sensible option at this point."
