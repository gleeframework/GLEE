"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm afraid $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is still a tough pill to swallow; this product is top-of-the-line!  To be fair to both of us, I'll come down to $10,500.  This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $9,500, which would be $10,000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",10000.0,Bob,6,
