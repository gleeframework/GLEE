{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product's potential will more than justify the cost.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I've kept the message friendly and focused on the value proposition. 
* **Price:**  I've chosen $1,500,000 as a starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to maximize my profit while still being realistic about Bob's potential interest.
* **Negotiation Room:** A higher starting price allows for potential negotiation down to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Potential Value:** By highlighting the product's potential, I'm trying to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to consider the value beyond just the price.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  I'll need to adjust based on Bob's response and any additional information I gather about his perceived value for the product."
