"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that my initial price was a bit high for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price for a product of this quality.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While I want to be fair, $90 is still quite low for me. How about we do $110? This is my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
