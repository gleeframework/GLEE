"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you:**  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000. This saves you $300,000.
* **You'll still make a profit:** Even at $1,200,000, you are buying the product for less than its value to you ($1,500,000)."
