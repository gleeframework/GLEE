"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I know it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm happy to accept a price that's fair for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice is overselling:**  Alice's message tries to convince you the product is worth $15,000 to you, which it isn't. This suggests she might be willing to go lower.
* **You have a backup:** You know John will sell you the product for $15,000. This gives you leverage to negotiate.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you might prompt her to propose a lower price, closer to her $12,000 valuation."
