{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to the $120 value that Bob has in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum price.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to compromise and offer the product for $115.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my minimum price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is below my minimum price. Even though I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go that low.  It's better for me to sell to John for $120 and ensure I get at least my minimum price."
