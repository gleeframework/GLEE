"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate. It's important to start lower to allow room for negotiation while still being a reasonable enough offer to keep Alice interested."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $800,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?

This counter-offer shows Alice that you're willing to negotiate and move closer to her price, but you're still holding firm on getting a significant discount."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000.

Alice has come down considerably and is now offering a $350,000 discount. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and at $650,000, it's a good deal compared to John's $1,000,000 price."
