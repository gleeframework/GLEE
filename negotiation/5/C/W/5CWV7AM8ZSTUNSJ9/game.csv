"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $800,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $700,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind.  Would you consider $600,000? I think that's a fair offer.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
