Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Creating urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" might push Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it allows you to potentially negotiate down to a price that's still significantly higher than Bob's valuation while remaining above your minimum."
