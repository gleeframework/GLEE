"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'll counter with $92.50. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for such a valuable item.",92.5,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $87.50. I'll try to find a middle ground. I'll counter with $92, which is $2.50 more than my previous offer. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",92.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $92. I'd be willing to pay $88 for the product. Can you consider that?",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $88. I'll try to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. I'll counter with $90.50, which is $1.50 more than your last offer. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",90.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to find a sweet spot, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90.50 and $88, which is $89.25. Can you consider that?",89.25,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to meet you exactly at $89.25. I'll counter with $90, which is a small increase from my previous offer. I'm confident you'll find it's still a fair price for the product.",90.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to pay $89 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",89.0,Bob,10,
