# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth over $150 to me. Considering its quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $200 for it. I believe this is a fair offer given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of that, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $120 for the product? This still reflects its value to me while accommodating your financial situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is still too high for Bob's budget. While it's a step in the right direction, Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his target price of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $120 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm committed to getting this product, but I can only go up to $90.  It's a fair price considering its value to me and my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. Let's try $100 as the price for the product. It's still above what I initially offered but closer to your proposed price, aiming for a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than the maximum he's willing to pay. Bob should continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to his target of $80. There are still several rounds left, so there's room to bargain."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit higher than what I can afford. I'm prepared to pay $95. This is a good compromise and hopefully, we can finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 95}
