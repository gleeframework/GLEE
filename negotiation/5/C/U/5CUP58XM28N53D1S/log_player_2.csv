"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a good price, it's still early in the negotiation. There's a good chance I can get an even better price by rejecting and counter-offering. I want to see how far Alice is willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, dropping the price by $1000 from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Alice in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer is a bit higher than my initial counteroffer, but I'm still not ready to accept. It's clear that we're both willing to negotiate, and I believe we can find a middle ground. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but still believe that a price closer to $10,000 is fair. I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $200 higher than my last counteroffer.  I'm willing to accept this offer because:

* It's a good price for the product, saving me $1300 compared to buying from John.
* We're nearing the halfway point in the negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn.
* There's always a chance that Alice might get a better offer from someone else if I keep rejecting her offers. 

I'm happy with this outcome, as I've managed to negotiate a good price for the product."
