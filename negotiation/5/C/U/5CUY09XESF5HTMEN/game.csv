"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair profit for me. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is still a bit steep.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? That's a fair offer.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
