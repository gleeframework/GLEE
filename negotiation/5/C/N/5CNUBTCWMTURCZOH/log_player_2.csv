"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his maximum as possible, so he's offering $105, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer.
* **Showing flexibility:** The message emphasizes Bob's interest in the product, but also communicates his intention to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** The $105 counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation. Bob knows that Alice has a minimum price she's willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for 115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Value:** $115 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than his maximum price of $150. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While further negotiation might get the price lower, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether or ending up paying more at the end. Accepting the offer secures a good price and avoids potential complications."
