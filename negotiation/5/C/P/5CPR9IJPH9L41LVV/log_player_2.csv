"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $900,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're aiming to get the best possible price, and $900,000 is still quite a bit higher than Alice's likely minimum. Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which is still a significant profit for you and a good deal for me. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business and the profit we'll make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is a good price, you can likely still do better.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $875,000 is still a bit higher than my target, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd be happy to pay $860,000.  This is a fair price that leaves room for profit for both of us."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. After careful consideration, we're willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $870,000. We believe this is a fair price that meets your needs while still allowing us to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you're very close to your target price and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise. Accepting the offer for $870,000 saves you $130,000 compared to buying from John and is a good deal for both parties.  There's always the risk of further negotiation, but the potential gains are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal."
