"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $900,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential value of this product, $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiations.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is closer to the middle ground we're looking for.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, $825,000 is still a bit short of my target. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to offer $875,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it reflects the value of this product. Let's finalize this deal at this price, as it's a fair compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,6,
