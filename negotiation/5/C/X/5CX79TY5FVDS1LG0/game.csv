"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000 if you are open to discussing further.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't accept a price as low as $1,800,000. Could you consider $1,900,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
