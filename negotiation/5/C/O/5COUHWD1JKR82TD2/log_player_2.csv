"Round 1

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is too expensive at $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it's necessary to signal my serious intent to purchase while setting a strong starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  I want to see if she'll budge closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,100,000. This is a more moderate increase than my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Alice's offer is only $50,000 above my limit, and it's unlikely I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's time to accept the offer and move on."
