{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $11,000 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value ($10,000) to see if he's willing to pay a premium.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $11,000 is still less than my minimum value of $12,000, allowing for some room to negotiate if needed.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  
* **Potential for better deal:** I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob or potentially John if I continue negotiations. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiations open and allows me to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by emphasizing his potential satisfaction. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** $10,500 is still above my minimum value of $12,000, but it opens the door for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet at $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to get a good deal on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,800 is still below my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Negotiation room:**  I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counter-offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $12,000 is guaranteed, the potential to get a higher price from Bob is worth the risk of another negotiation round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference again and go with $10,150.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price that benefits both parties, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $10,150 is still above my minimum value of $12,000, but it's a significant step closer to Bob's desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $10,150 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,000, so how about $10,050? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $10,050 is very close to my minimum value of $12,000, it's still below it.  
* **Potential for further negotiations:** Bob is clearly holding firm at a price that's less than I'm comfortable with.  Further negotiations are likely to be protracted and could result in even lower offers. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob that could result in a lower price.  

I'm choosing to secure the guaranteed profit with John rather than risking a lower price with Bob."
