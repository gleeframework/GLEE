,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet at $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to get a good deal on this product.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference again and go with $10,150.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $10,150 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,000, so how about $10,050? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",10050.0,Bob,6,
