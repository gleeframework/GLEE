"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. However,  $15,000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,500?  I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $13,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. It's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and the potential of this product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
