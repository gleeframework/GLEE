Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm aiming for a price point that aligns better with my budget. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet halfway at $1,200,000?  I think that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While I could push for more, Bob meeting at $1,200,000 matches my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure a sure deal now than risk getting less later."
