"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000.  This represents a considerable investment on your part, but I'm confident the returns will be well worth it.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, and I want to make this deal work.  However, $825,000 is pushing the boundaries of what I can accept. My final offer is $875,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",875000.0,Alice,5,
