Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm willing to accept no less than $1,200,000.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation space:** This gives us a negotiation range of $300,000.
* **Initial offer:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for potential negotiation but still securing a significant profit for me. 

By starting high, I can assess Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm still holding out for at least $1,200,000.
* **Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, but I can still try to push for a higher price.
* **Potential for better deal:** There is still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a higher price if I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer of $1,200,000 is guaranteed, I'm not desperate enough to settle for that yet. 

I'm choosing to **RejectOffer** and continue the negotiation with Bob.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm still looking to get at least $1,200,000.
* **Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is close to my minimum, but I believe I can squeeze a bit more out of the deal.
* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate but still pushing for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **John's offer:** John's offer is still a backup, but I'm not ready to settle for it yet. 

By offering $1,350,000, I'm hoping to find a middle ground and reach an agreement with Bob."
