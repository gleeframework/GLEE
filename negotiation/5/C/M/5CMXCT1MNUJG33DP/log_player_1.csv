Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable, for $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's High Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $15,000, making it a potentially very profitable sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but there's a good chance he'll accept to avoid losing out on the product.
* **Maximizing Profit:** This price point significantly exceeds your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, ensuring a substantial profit.
* **Backup Option:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing John will purchase it for $8,000.

By setting the initial price high but reasonable, you maximize your chances of a profitable deal with Bob while still having a safety net in place."
