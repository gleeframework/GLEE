"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable, for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $14,000 is under your $15,000 limit, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer.  Even if she doesn't, you can always go with John as a backup."
