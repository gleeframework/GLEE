# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject the offer.  You're willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice is offering $900,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's worth considering.

While Alice's offer of $875,000 is closer to your target, you're still paying more than your ideal price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to $800,000."
