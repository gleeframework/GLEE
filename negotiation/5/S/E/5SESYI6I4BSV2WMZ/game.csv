"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $11,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, let's see if we can make this work.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $14,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to be close to your minimum price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a fair price that considers both of our positions. Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $14,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can offer the product to you for $13,750. This is as close to my minimum price as I'm willing to go.",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be fair here, but $13,750 is still a bit too high for me. I can go up to $13,000, which is my final offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement before I have to consider other options.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get to at least $13,500. How about we meet at $13,500? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",13500.0,Alice,9,
