"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's quality, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which I think is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm placing on the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal."", ""product_price"": 90}"
