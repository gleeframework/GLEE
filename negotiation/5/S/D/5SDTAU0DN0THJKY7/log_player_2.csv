"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $100 for it. This is a fair deal that allows you to acquire something of significant value while also providing me with a reasonable return. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are willing to pay up to $80, and Alice is offering $100. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's quality, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which I think is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm placing on the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $80. The product has a significant value to both of us, and I believe we can find a middle ground that respects its worth. How about we consider $90 as a fair price? This would allow you to secure the product within your budget while ensuring a reasonable return for me. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice has lowered her price from $100 to $90, which is closer to your budget. However, you're still willing to pay a maximum of $80.  John is offering the product for that price, so it's the best option to avoid further negotiation and buy from John."
