"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth $1200000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount, and it's a chance for you to acquire something that will be very beneficial to your business. I understand that this is a substantial investment, but I'm confident that you'll be happy with the return. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to sell to you first. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
