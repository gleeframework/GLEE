"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're willing to meet me in the middle, but I was thinking I could do a bit better than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $96.50 and $90, which would be $93.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",93.5,Alice,7,,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $93.50. I'm willing to meet you at $92, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might not be able to get a better deal elsewhere.",92.0,Bob,8,,
