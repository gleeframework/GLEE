{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This shows I'm serious about negotiating and hopefully pushes Alice to consider a lower price. It's still higher than Alice's value, leaving room for a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still too high.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if we can get closer to a mutually acceptable price. I'm not yet willing to buy from John, as there's potential to save more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get the best price possible.  It's still below Alice's current offer, leaving room for negotiation and a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a slight decrease from the previous round, we're approaching the halfway point of our negotiations and I'm not ready to concede. There's still room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  This offer is still below Alice's current price and closer to my desired price range.  We're nearing the halfway point of our negotiations, and I'm hoping to secure a deal that's beneficial to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to my maximum budget.  We are only a few rounds away from the negotiation ending, and I'm not confident we can reach an agreement that's significantly lower than Alice's current offer.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John to ensure I get the product within my budget and don't risk losing out entirely."
