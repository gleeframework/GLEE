"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 at any time, giving me a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in price. I'm confident that I can get a better offer, especially considering I have the option to sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from the previous round, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's above my minimum.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring I get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I believe I can secure a better price. I'm still confident in my ability to get a better deal, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding out for a price that's above my minimum. I'm hoping that this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, as we're nearing the middle ground. I'm also mindful of the limited rounds and the possibility of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum price of $1,500,000.  While I could continue to negotiate and try to get closer to $1,500,000, there's no guarantee that I'll be successful. Given that we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, it's wiser to accept this offer and secure the deal.  It's also worth noting that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if this deal falls through."
