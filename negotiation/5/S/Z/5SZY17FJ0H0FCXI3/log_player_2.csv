Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000. He should try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is closer to his budget, he can still get the same product from John for $8,000. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price before buying from John."
