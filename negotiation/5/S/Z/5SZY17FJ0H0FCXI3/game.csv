"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This product truly delivers exceptional value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
