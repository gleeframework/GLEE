``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my desired price and my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to negotiate a more favorable deal."

Bob's offer:

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm going to try to reach a more favorable price."
