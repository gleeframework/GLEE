"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $1,000,000, and it gives me a fair price for my product. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  Let's compromise at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us. It's the value you place on the product, and it allows me to meet my minimum acceptable value.  It's a win-win situation! What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
