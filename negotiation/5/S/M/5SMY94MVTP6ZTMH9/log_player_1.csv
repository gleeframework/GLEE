{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $11,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This keeps the possibility of a deal alive.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems great, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $10,750 is still a stretch for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $10,625.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now just above your minimum of $10,600. While you might prefer to get a bit closer to your initial target, it's unlikely you'll get a better offer from Bob.  Accepting his offer is the best option, as it's a good deal for you and avoids risking a further breakdown in negotiations."
