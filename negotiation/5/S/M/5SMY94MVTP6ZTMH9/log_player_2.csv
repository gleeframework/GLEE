"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $11,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems great, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering a price closer to his maximum budget, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows he's serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's getting closer to his ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to continue bargaining and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $10,750 is still a stretch for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $10,625.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 10625}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a final price that is within his budget and hopefully acceptable to Alice. By offering a price slightly higher than his previous counteroffer, he shows he's willing to compromise but still wants to save money. The offer is also slightly lower than Alice's latest offer, suggesting a willingness to split the difference."
