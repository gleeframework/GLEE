"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $11,000. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product seems great, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That would be a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $10,750 is still a stretch for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $10,625.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction.",10625.0,Bob,4,
