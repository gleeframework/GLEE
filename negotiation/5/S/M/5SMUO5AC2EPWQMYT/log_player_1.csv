{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.

Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** We're in the final round, and I'm not confident that I can push Bob any further.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While John is offering a lower price, it's still a significant amount of money. It's possible that by selling to John, I can open up new opportunities for future deals that might be more lucrative.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to more back-and-forth and a higher risk of not closing a deal at all. 

By selling to John, I'm securing a guaranteed sale and avoiding the risk of losing the deal altogether."
