"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,100,000 is too far below my minimum. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential for profit.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in that price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
