"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find this price fair. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This price is still fair for both of us, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's meet in the middle.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $11,750. Can you consider this price?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $11,750 is still a little below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $12,250. This compromise should be fair for both of us, and keeps the deal on track. Let me know what you think.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I really like the product, but I'm not willing to go above $12,000. Can you meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,6,
