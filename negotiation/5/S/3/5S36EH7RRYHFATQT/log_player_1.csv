Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** Ideally, I want to get as close to my minimum value of $120 as possible. 
* **Starting Point:**  Offering $115 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Flexibility:**  By starting high, I create space for potential counteroffers and can adjust the price if needed.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The existence of John, who's willing to pay $120, gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum value of $120 and also lower than my initial offer of $115.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's counteroffer is low, it shows he's interested. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate a better price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a backup option with John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the conversation going!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving the Needle:** This counteroffer moves the price closer to my desired range while still acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to continue negotiations.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate that the price is still a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the product's worth.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for further adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $105 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $102.50? That way, we can both feel good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, $102.5 is still below the $120 I need to get.
* **Small Improvement:**  The difference between his offer and my previous counteroffer is small, indicating he might be willing to budge a bit more.
* **Stronger Position:** I have John as a backup buyer, giving me the leverage to hold out for a price closer to my target.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can push for a price closer to $110 or $115 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $102.5 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's try $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Target:** This counteroffer brings the price closer to my desired range, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but not conceding too quickly.
* **Emphasizing Fair Value:** I highlight the value of the product to justify the price, encouraging Bob to see the benefit of a slightly higher offer.
* **Mutually Beneficial:**  I frame the price as allowing both of us to walk away satisfied, aiming to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Final Push:**  This counteroffer is a final push before potentially switching to John if Bob rejects again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit far apart, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $107.50, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really like the product, but I need to stick to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Enough:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $107.5 is still below my minimum value of $120. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.
* **Time is Money:**  The back-and-forth negotiations are taking time and energy.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who's willing to pay my minimum price.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the opportunity to sell the product to John and secure my desired profit. 

It's important to remember that I have a concrete alternative with John.  While Bob's interest is good, I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't meet my needs.  Selling to John allows me to maximize my profit and minimize the time spent negotiating."
