"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the conversation going!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $105 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $102.50? That way, we can both feel good about the deal.",102.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $102.5 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's try $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit far apart, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $107.50, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really like the product, but I need to stick to my budget.",107.5,Bob,6,
