Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  I'm sure you'll agree that this price is fair, considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but still below my minimum value ($1,200,000). This allows room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the value Bob will receive from the product to make the price seem more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I leave the door open for counteroffers and further discussion.  

**This strategy aims to:**

* **Maximize my profit:**  I want to get as close to my minimum value as possible.
* **Keep Bob interested:** By starting high, I encourage Bob to negotiate and potentially agree on a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintain the option of John:**  I can always choose to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping for. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering and continuing the negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining leverage and signaling that I'm not desperate to sell. 

I'll now proceed to make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I believe this is a fair compromise and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not sticking to my initial price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the middle:** $950,000 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a desire to find common ground.
* **Reiterating value:**  I again remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Setting a deadline:** While not explicitly stated, this counteroffer implies that I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't accept a price close to my minimum. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum value as possible.
* **Keep Bob interested:**  By showing a willingness to negotiate, I'm increasing the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining my negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he might walk away, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** Even if I accept this offer, there's still a chance that Bob might be willing to increase his offer in the future, potentially leading to an even better price for me. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale that is close to my minimum value and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether. It also opens the possibility for future negotiation and potential profit."
