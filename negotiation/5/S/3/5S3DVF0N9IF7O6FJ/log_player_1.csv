Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for your needs. Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is offering $10,000, which is closer to his value than my initial offer. While I could hold out for more, there's a chance I might lose him as a buyer. Selling to John guarantees my minimum, but there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I'll counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to go a bit lower. How about $11,000? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is now at $11,000, which is a reasonable profit above my minimum. There's a risk he walks away if I push further, and John offers a sure thing.
