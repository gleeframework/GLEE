"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $900,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This allows me to make a fair profit while giving you a price that's closer to your desired range.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $920,000 is closer, but still a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle at $935,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",935000.0,Alice,5,
