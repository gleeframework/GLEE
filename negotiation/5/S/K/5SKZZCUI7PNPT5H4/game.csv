"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as I already have other interested parties.  Let me know if this works for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,750,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  I know you have other interested parties, but this is the highest I can go.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
