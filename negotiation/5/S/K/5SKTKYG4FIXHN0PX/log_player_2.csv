"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the potential it holds, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I recognize the value of the product. However, I had a different budget in mind. Would you be willing to consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer but still within a reasonable range considering my maximum budget is $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating my price point. 

I'm aiming to get the price closer to John's offer ($10,000) while leaving some flexibility for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. After careful consideration, I'm willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer for the product is $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price range, but I'm still above John's offer.  I'll try to push the price down a little further.  There's a risk Alice won't budge much more, but I'm willing to take it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice.  To be completely transparent, I did find a comparable product for $10,000. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** I'm being upfront about John's offer without directly naming him. This adds a sense of urgency and honesty to the negotiation.
* **Final Offer (for now):** Offering my maximum budget signals that I'm serious, but also willing to walk away if Alice doesn't budge. 
* **Call to Action:** By expressing readiness to ""close the deal today,"" I'm encouraging a quick decision."
