"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is unfortunately not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That way, we both get a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about we try $9,750? That's the best I can do.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I still need to stay above $10,000 to make this work for me. How about we meet halfway between our last two offers at $10,125? I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10125.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,125, but I can only go as high as $9,912.50. That's the best I can do.",9912.5,Bob,6,
