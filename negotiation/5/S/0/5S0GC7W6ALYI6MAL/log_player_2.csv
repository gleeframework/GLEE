(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's offering it to me for $12,000, which is $4,000 more than its value to her. I can get the same product from John for $15,000, which is still a better deal than Alice's offer.
