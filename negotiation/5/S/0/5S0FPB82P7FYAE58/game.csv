"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit steep. Could you do $750,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'll offer you a revised price of $825,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this. $825,000 is getting closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $780,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential value.",780000.0,Bob,6,
