Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer price of $1,300,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers a substantial discount compared to your guaranteed offer from John.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" and ""other interested parties,"" you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially influencing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject this offer, leading you to accept the $1,500,000 from John. However, the potential for a higher profit with Bob makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
