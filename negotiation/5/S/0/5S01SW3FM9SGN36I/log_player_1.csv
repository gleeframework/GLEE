Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  A higher initial offer helps you understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he accepts immediately, you've potentially left money on the table. If he negotiates, you can gauge his willingness to pay."
