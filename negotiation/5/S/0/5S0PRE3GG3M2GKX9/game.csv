"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13,500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to $12,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $12,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering we're close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $13,250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13250.0,Alice,5,
