Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $12,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go.
