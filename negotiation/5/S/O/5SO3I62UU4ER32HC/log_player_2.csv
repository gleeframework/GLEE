Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $90 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That would work much better for my budget."",

}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason:  We're aiming to gradually move towards a price closer to our budget while still showing willingness to negotiate.  Offering $75 keeps the negotiation moving and provides a balance between our target price and Alice's lower offer."")

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $80. I can offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.
