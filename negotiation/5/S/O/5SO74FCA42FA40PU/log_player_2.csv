"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price tailored just for you. Given its value to you, I propose we discuss a price that reflects both its worth and your interest. Would you be open to exploring a mutually beneficial arrangement? Let's aim for something around $100 to ensure it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer of $100 is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product ($80) and leaves you with minimal savings compared to your maximum price ($120). By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This opens the door for further negotiation with Alice, potentially leading to a price closer to your desired range."
