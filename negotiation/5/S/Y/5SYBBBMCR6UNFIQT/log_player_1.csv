Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $1,400,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's valuation of $800,000 but still lower than my guaranteed sale price of $1,500,000 to John. This allows for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've kept the message professional and positive, highlighting the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob.  I've also left the door open for negotiation.

**Strategy:** 

This strategy aims to maximize profit by:

* **Minimizing risk:** By having John as a backup buyer, I am not forced to accept a price lower than my minimum value.
* **Potential for higher profit:** By offering a price slightly lower than my minimum, I increase the chance of Bob accepting, potentially securing a better deal than my guaranteed sale price.

Remember, this is just an initial offer.  Bob may counter-offer, and I would then need to decide whether to accept or make a counter-offer of my own."
