This is a good starting point.  $1,200,000 is a decent price, but you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer lets you see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."

This is still a great deal considering the product's potential, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you're still within your budget and can potentially negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
