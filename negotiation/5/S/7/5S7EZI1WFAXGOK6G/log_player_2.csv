# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so paying $13,000 to Alice is not a good deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find common ground.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's closer to his desired price, he can still get the product for $12,000 from John.  There's no reason to pay more."
