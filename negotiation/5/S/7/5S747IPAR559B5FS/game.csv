,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1400000? I believe we could find a mutually beneficial solution.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  However, $1400000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1450000.  This would be a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, I must respectfully decline at $1450000. Given my current budget, I am only able to consider offers closer to $1400000. I hope we can reach an agreement that respects both our positions.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
