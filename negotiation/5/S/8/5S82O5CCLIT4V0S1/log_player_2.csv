```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that considers your needs while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 simply doesn't cover the value and potential of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While $975,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm offering $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your effort to find a compromise. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  Given your previous offer, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it will allow both of us to walk away happy with the deal. Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my target price of $800,000. With only three rounds left, the chances of negotiating further are slim. It's better to secure the product from John for my desired price."
