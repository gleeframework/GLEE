"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in exploring this opportunity further, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum price point, given my current financial constraints.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a stretch for you. However, I still believe the product has significant value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still beyond my current budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $900000. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my financial constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to balance the value of the product with your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I get closer to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer it to you for $1100000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget constraints.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
