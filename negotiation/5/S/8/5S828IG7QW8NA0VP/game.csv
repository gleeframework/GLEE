"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
