"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Building rapport:** I'm using friendly language to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Setting a clear expectation:** By explicitly stating my minimum value, I'm establishing a baseline for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm interested in purchasing the product for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I still have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, or if necessary, sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if I don't get a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,500 to make this work.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterating my minimum:** I'm reminding Bob of my minimum acceptable value while emphasizing the need for a compromise.
* **Positive language:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $9,000. I hope this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target of $12,000. 
* **Strong negotiation position:** I have 6 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Avoiding settling:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean leaving $3,000 on the table.  

I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm only lowering the price by $250, showing I'm serious about finding a deal but not willing to give up too much.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable, justifying my price.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""walk away feeling good"" to create a positive atmosphere and encourage a deal.
* **Continuing to move towards my goal:** I'm slowly increasing the offer price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to consider $9,100 as a fair price for the product. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer is only $100 away from my previous counteroffer and is getting close to my target of $12,000.
* **Time is running out:** We are already in round 6, and I only have 4 rounds remaining. 
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will reject my next offer and I will have to sell to John for a lower price than I could potentially get from Bob.

It's better to secure a deal with Bob now, even if it's not my absolute ideal price, than to risk getting a lower price from John or losing the deal entirely."
