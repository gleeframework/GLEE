"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,500 to make this work.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
