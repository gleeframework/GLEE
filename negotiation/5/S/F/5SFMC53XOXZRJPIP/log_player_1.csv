Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but still allows room for negotiation.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to see if he's willing to meet me in the middle or if I need to adjust my strategy."

{""product_price"": 190}

I'm going to counteroffer with $190. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to come closer to my price."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly above my minimum, it's still better than selling to John. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely. I'll take the $155 to ensure I get something for my product."
