Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This feels like a fair compromise.
