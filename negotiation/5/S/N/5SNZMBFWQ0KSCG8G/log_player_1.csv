"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I can do better. I'll try to negotiate a higher price."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a decent compromise and only $200 less than what John would pay. I want to get this deal done, and it seems like Bob is firm on his price."
