"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a better price to maximize savings. We'll aim lower in the next round."

{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $1,000,000 is still too high. We're getting closer to our outside option with John, so we need to be strategic in our next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is a little too far out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $700,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the current market value."",
 ""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to compromise at $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

Alice is coming down, but we're getting close to our walk-away point. We need to signal that we're serious about the $800,000 option without completely ending the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $950,000 is really pushing my budget limits. To be completely transparent, I do have another option for $800,000.  However, I believe your product is superior, and I'd prefer to work something out with you if possible.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 750000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty about your other option, Bob. I'm glad you think our product is superior. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've acknowledged the product brings. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.

We've got Alice moving, and we're close to our target.  It's worth one more push to see if we can secure the product for a price closer to $800,000."

{
 ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate you understanding my budget constraints.  Would you be willing to settle at $810,000?  If so, I can close the deal today."",

}
```"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. I think $810,000 is a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $810,000. I'll compromise at $820,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

This is a good deal! We've managed to negotiate a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and only slightly above our alternative option. Accepting this offer secures the superior product at a price that works for us."
