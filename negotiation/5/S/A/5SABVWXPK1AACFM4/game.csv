"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential value. I believe this is a reasonable offer and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which still reflects the significant value this product offers. This is a fair price that accounts for both our interests.  Let's find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. While $1200000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
