Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase [product name] before I make it available to anyone else. I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, especially given your current operations in [Bob's industry/area of interest]. I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob specifically, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is a pre-market offer to Bob creates a sense of urgency and importance. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant. You can always adjust your price downwards, using your $1,500,000 guarantee as a safety net."
