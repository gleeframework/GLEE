"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $16000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $14000, so I'll offer it to you for $15000. This is my final counteroffer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
