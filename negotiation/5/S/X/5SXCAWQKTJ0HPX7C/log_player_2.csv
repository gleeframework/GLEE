"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to let it go for $150. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since Alice's offer is the same as John's, and you're looking to save money, there's no advantage in rejecting Alice's offer. Accepting it means you get the product at the same price you'd pay John."
