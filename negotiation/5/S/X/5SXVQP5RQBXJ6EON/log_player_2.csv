"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice my absolute maximum price, which is $8,000.  This shows her that I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not willing to go higher. Hopefully, she'll accept this offer, as I'm ready to buy it at this price.  If she doesn't, I can always buy from John at this price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as it's clear she's not willing to come down to a price I'm comfortable with. It's much more advantageous to simply buy the product from John for $8,000, which is within my budget."
