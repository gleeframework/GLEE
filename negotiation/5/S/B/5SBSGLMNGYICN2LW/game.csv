,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be able to go up to $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130? That's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $110.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",110.0,Bob,4,
