"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below our $100 limit.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial counteroffer helps gauge Alice's flexibility. Her response will give us a better idea of how low she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $85.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:**  Alice reducing her price indicates a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:** While $85 is better, it's still above her $80 value. We have room to push for a lower price. 
* **Time on Our Side:** We're only on round 3 of 10. There's no need to rush into accepting a price that's not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and agree on $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We're signaling a willingness to move closer to Alice's price while still negotiating for a good deal.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:**  $77 is slightly above her $70 counteroffer but still significantly below her current offer of $85.  It positions us well for a final agreement somewhere in the low 80s. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  By proposing a specific number, we keep the negotiation moving forward and encourage Alice to respond with a concrete counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $77 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $82.  This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Price:** $82 is a very reasonable price, well below our $100 maximum and only slightly above Alice's perceived value. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** While Alice might not actually walk away, her statement adds pressure to accept. It's unlikely we'll get a significantly better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate for a few dollars difference isn't worth the risk of Alice walking away or the potential time cost of multiple rounds."
