Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below your minimum ($120) allows room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but thinks the price is a bit steep. 
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob (e.g., is he prone to negotiation, how badly does he need the product) you might adjust your approach."
