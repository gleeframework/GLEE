"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11250. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $11250.  How about we split the difference and go with $10875? It's a fair price for both of us and avoids further haggling.",10875.0,Bob,4,
