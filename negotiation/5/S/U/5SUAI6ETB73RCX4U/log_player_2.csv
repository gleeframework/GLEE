"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $11000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save $1,000 by negotiating with Alice.  While $11,000 is a good price, Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $11,000. However, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  Alice has come down from $11,000 to $11,250, but Bob can likely get closer to his goal of $10,500.  It's worth continuing the negotiation for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,250.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,875? It's a fair price for both of us and avoids further haggling."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as high as $10875. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $11200. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is facing a decision:

* **Accept Alice's offer:** This would give Bob the product for $11,200, saving him $800 compared to buying from John.
* **Reject Alice's offer:** This risks further negotiation and potentially ending up paying the full $12,000 to John. 

While Bob could potentially get closer to his ideal price, the risk of ending up with a worse deal from John makes it more logical to accept Alice's offer. He's already secured a substantial saving, and further negotiation might not be worth the potential loss."
