"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $9,000 is a bit high for my budget.  How about $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value of the product.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go to $8,600. This is a fair price, considering your cost, and it allows us to close the deal.",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,700. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8700.0,Alice,5,
