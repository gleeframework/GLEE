"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  While I see the value in this product, I'm not able to go above $12,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your constraints, but I'm still a bit away from your price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product brings to your business.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit stretched at that price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,750?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,200. This is my final offer, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",13200.0,Alice,5,
