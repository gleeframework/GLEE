"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Aiming closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) increases the chances of him engaging in negotiation, rather than immediately rejecting the offer.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While John offers a safe $800,000, there's a significant potential profit to be made with Bob.  This starting offer keeps that door open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly lower than both your initial ask and Bob's perceived value of the product.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, I believe the value this product brings warrants a higher figure. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. Splitting the difference between the previous two offers ($1,100,000 and $950,000) suggests fairness.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  The counteroffer still keeps the price significantly above John's offer, reflecting the understanding of the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, signaling he's willing to pay more but trying to get a good deal.  We're still far above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate further and encourage Bob to move closer to $1 million."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show I'm serious about reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,000,000 even?  This reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down to a round number like $1,000,000 makes the offer seem more appealing and significant. 
* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer still holds strong at a price point that reflects the product's value while acknowledging Bob's negotiation efforts. 
* **Time Consideration:** As we are now past the halfway point in the rounds, applying a bit more pressure with a strong, yet still somewhat flexible, offer is strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $950,000 is a significant profit above John's offer ($800,000).
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has repeated this offer twice now, suggesting it might be his upper limit.  
* **Time Remaining:** While there are rounds left, there's no guarantee Bob will significantly increase his offer, and waiting risks him walking away entirely.  It's better to secure a very good deal now."
