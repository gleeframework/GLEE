"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9000 is still a bit high. I'm ready to pay $8500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",8500.0,Bob,4,
