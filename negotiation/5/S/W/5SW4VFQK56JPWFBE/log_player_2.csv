"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my [Product Name] for a price that's significantly below its market value. This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll see the immense value it brings. Let's discuss a price that benefits us both.  I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate down from a starting point that's already above your maximum price.  You have leverage because you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're not willing to overpay and open the door for a counter-offer closer to your desired range."
