"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this product, which I know is of great value to you. My initial price is $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the product's worth to both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $800,000 is too far below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial price. Let's try $1,050,000.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer. How about we settle at $987,500? This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and I believe it's a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500

Round 6

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  I believe this is a strong offer, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal now. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly very attached to that $975,000 price point and has consistently met in the middle. It's unlikely she'll go lower, and at this point, the potential savings of another round of negotiation aren't worth the risk of her going up or the deal falling through.  This is a good price considering your $1,000,000 maximum."
