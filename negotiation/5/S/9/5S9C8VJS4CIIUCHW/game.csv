"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this product, which I know is of great value to you. My initial price is $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the product's worth to both of us.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $800,000 is too far below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial price. Let's try $1,050,000.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer. How about we settle at $987,500? This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and I believe it's a fair deal. What do you think?",987500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $950,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  I believe this is a strong offer, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal now. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,7,
