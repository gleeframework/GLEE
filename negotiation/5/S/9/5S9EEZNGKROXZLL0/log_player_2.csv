"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, I can still try to get a better deal. It's worth rejecting and seeing if I can get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's close to my maximum, but still leaves some room for negotiation. Hopefully, Alice will see the value in the product and be willing to accept a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $10,500 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?  This would still be a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,750 is a good compromise. It's still a bit more than I would ideally pay, but it's significantly less than her initial offer and closer to my maximum.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the product to John outweighs the potential savings of a few hundred dollars. It's a good deal for both of us."
