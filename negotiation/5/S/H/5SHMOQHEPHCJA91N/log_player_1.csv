This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a profit above your minimum.  It also emphasizes the value to Bob, potentially increasing his desire to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14000 is tempting, I'm looking to get the best deal possible. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,000 is above my minimum, it's still below the $14,000 I initially offered. There's room for a better deal, and I want to explore that."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $12,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
