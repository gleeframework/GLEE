{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Our goal is to maximize profit.  We need to offer a price that is enticing to Bob (above his valuation) but also gives us a significant portion of the potential profit.

**The Offer:** By offering the product at $1,350,000, we create a win-win situation (potentially):

* **Bob:** If Bob accepts, he gains a product worth $1,000,000 to him for $350,000 less than its value to you (and our guaranteed offer from John). 
* **Alice (You):** You secure a profit of $350,000, which is a significant return. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate, or he might be unwilling to pay more than his perceived value. However, this starting point gives you a strong bargaining position while leaving room for potential negotiation."
