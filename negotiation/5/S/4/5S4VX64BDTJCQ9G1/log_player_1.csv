{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so $1,400,000 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This offer is still above your minimum of $1,500,000, so you're not giving away the product for less than it's worth to you. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for back-and-forth, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement.

If Bob rejects, you can adjust the price based on his counteroffer. Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,400,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I need to sell this product. However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm open to selling for $1,200,000. This price still gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good strategy because:

* **It's a compromise:** It's higher than Bob's offer but significantly lower than your initial offer, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's still profitable for you:** $1,200,000 is still above your minimum desired price of $1,500,000, so you're not losing money.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** You can still adjust the price depending on Bob's response, but it's closer to a potential agreement. 

By being firm but reasonable, you're increasing the chances of a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to compromise, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your latest offer of $1,200,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is within your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I don't want to continue negotiating with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll come up to my desired amount.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I get the value I need."
