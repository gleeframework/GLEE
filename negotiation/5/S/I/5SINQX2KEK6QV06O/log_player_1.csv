"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a good midpoint between my minimum of $80 and Bob's perceived value of $150. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110. It's a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his last offer. I hope this will encourage him to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to secure a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $105. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial target. I believe this price is more appealing to Bob, making it more likely for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally get closer to my initial target price, Bob's offer of $98 is only $2 away from my last counteroffer. I believe it's time to accept this offer as we only have 4 rounds left, and there's a risk of getting a lower offer or needing to sell to John."
