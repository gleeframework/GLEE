"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, it makes sense to accept her offer.  You don't gain anything by rejecting her offer and buying from John at the same price."
