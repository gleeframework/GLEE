Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is interested and to gauge his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I would like to sell to Bob, I cannot afford to accept his offer. I will counter-offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? This is the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter-offer one more time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're trying to stay within your budget.  $130 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $140?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, I've already made several concessions.  I've reached my limit with Bob, and I don't want to risk going lower. It's time to sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
