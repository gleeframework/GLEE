Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, briefly alluding to the product's value might make Bob more receptive.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone is suggestive rather than demanding, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  We don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above $10,000. A very high offer could make him immediately lose interest.
* **John as a Backup:** Having a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 gives you leverage. You don't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob.

This initial offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
