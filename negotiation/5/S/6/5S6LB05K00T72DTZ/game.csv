"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm personally valuing at no less than $15,000, and I know it's worth the same to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a slightly higher return. Let me know if you're interested!",16000.0,Alice,1,
