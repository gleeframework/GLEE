Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob and see if I can get a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $115. Let's meet in the middle. This is my final offer, so let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but I think it's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While $112 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob's hesitation makes me concerned that he might continue to lowball me. 

John's offer is guaranteed, and although it's less than I hoped for, it's still a decent profit. I'm willing to risk missing out on a slightly higher price from Bob to ensure a secure sale."
