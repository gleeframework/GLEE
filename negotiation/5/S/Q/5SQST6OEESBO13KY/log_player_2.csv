Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $800000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to your budget, you're still $100,000 over. You've shown Alice you're serious about negotiating and she's coming down on her price, so it's worth continuing to try and get that final $100,000 reduction."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm willing to go to $850,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While $875,000 is still $75,000 over your budget, it's a good deal considering:

* You're only two rounds away from having to buy from John for $800,000.
* There's a good chance Alice won't budge further, and you might end up paying more if you reject this offer.

This is a reasonable compromise, and accepting it ensures you get the product while still saving some money compared to buying from John."
