"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it for $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but  $13,500 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $12,500? "", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Alice's value for the product ($12,000). Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to his target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's split the difference - how about $12,750? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I was thinking more like $13,250. It's still a good deal for you, and it's the highest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $13,250.** This is a fair price considering:
    * It's lower than John's offer of $15,000.
    * It's higher than Alice's valuation of $12,000, meaning she's still making a profit.
    * It's close to Bob's previous offer of $12,750, indicating a potential middle ground.

* **Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky.**  Continuing to reject offers might lead Alice to walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

* **Accepting the offer is a safe and reasonable choice.** It allows Bob to secure the product at a price lower than John's while still allowing Alice to make a profit."
