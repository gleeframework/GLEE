"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it allows room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm aiming to understand Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum just yet. I believe there's potential for a higher price, especially since I have 8 more rounds for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can see if he's willing to increase his bid or if he's genuinely only interested in $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that the product holds a value higher than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I have 6 more rounds to work with, and I don't want to rush into a deal unless I'm confident I'm getting the best price possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet in the middle. It's also higher than Bob's latest offer, demonstrating that I still value the product at a higher price. This should keep the negotiation moving forward without jeopardizing my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum value of $15,000, and we're only 4 rounds away from having to sell to John.  Accepting this offer ensures a profit, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go much higher."
