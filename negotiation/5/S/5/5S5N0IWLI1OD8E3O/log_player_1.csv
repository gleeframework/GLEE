Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $88 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $87, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly anchored at $87.  It's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting his offer secures a profit above my minimum."
