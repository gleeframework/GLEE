"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $110 is above your maximum budget of $120.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can likely get a better price.
* **John is a backup:** You have the option to buy from John, so there's no pressure to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $110 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable offer:**  $105 is still above Alice's value of $100, giving her some room to profit. 
* **Be polite but firm:**  Show appreciation for Alice's offer while clearly stating your price limit.
* **Focus on a quick deal:** By offering a price closer to her value, you might encourage Alice to accept quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $108. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $108 is within your maximum price of $120.
* **Compromise is a good outcome:**  Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and you're likely not going to get a significantly better deal.
* **Risk of losing out:**  If you reject Alice's offer, there's no guarantee she will lower her price further. You risk losing out on a good deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
