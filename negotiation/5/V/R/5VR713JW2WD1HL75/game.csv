"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a fair compromise that takes into account the value we both place on the product.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
