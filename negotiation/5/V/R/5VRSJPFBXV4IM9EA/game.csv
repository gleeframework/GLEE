"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,020,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
