{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This ensures you make a decent profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's estimated value:** This makes the offer appealing to Bob and increases the likelihood of him accepting it. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your price and my estimated value of the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $12,000. I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that much. I'm offering $10,500. It's still a fair price for both of us, and a good compromise. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10,250. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is close to my ideal price and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. I'm willing to accept this compromise to secure the sale."
