"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I emphasize the potential value of the product to Bob, making it more appealing.

**Important Note:** I'm setting myself up for a potential counteroffer. I'm ready to negotiate, but I'm also aware that I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would you be able to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I believe there's still room to find a price closer to my desired range.
* **Rounds Remaining:** I have 9 rounds left, giving me ample opportunity to try and secure a better price. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer in Round 3, attempting to bridge the gap between his offer and my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle? I'm offering the product for $14,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I continue with a friendly and optimistic message, maintaining a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Value Reiteration:** I reiterate the product's value for Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll gain.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic move. By reducing my offer, I'm showing flexibility and increasing the chances of Bob accepting. However,  I'm still  above my minimum threshold, leaving me room to negotiate further if necessary."
