"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from the product's true value. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway. How about we settle at $1,125,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,187,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
