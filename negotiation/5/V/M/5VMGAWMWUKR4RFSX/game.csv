"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $850,000. How about we discuss a price of $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $900,000.  Let's try to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we discuss a price of $920,000?",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $920,000 is still pushing my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize this purchase.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $910,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $910,000, which would be $915,000. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",915000.0,Alice,7,
