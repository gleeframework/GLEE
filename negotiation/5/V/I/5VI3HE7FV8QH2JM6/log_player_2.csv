"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  He's willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the bargaining process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, but it's still within his budget.  He's hoping to get a deal close to Alice's minimum value, but he's leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is a good compromise. Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000, and this price is still within his budget. It's also a reasonable price for Alice, given her minimum value of $8,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
