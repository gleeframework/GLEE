"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $700,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $650,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $625,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",625000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another move, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $675,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",675000.0,Alice,5,
