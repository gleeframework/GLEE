"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I understand it's a bit higher than what you initially wanted to pay, but  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This would still give you a good deal on a valuable product. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
