"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more to you than you realize.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to hopefully pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I understand it's a bit higher than what you initially wanted to pay, but  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This would still give you a good deal on a valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a counteroffer that's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly what the product is worth to him. It's not ideal for me, but it's better than selling to John for $15,000. I'm accepting the offer to secure the sale."
