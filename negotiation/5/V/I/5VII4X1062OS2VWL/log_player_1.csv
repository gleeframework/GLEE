"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay before potentially engaging with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm rejecting it and will counteroffer in the next round.  While $1,200,000 is a guaranteed sale, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,300,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price given Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it is getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my goal with a counteroffer in the next round. While I could sell to John now, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000. This is a very small step down from my last offer and is right at my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal and that he should seriously consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether, so I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's still a significant profit and guarantees a sale."
