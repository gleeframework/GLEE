Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and direct, acknowledging Bob's interest and opening the door for discussion. 

**Strategy:**

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for profit:** Even if Bob accepts this offer, I'll still make a profit.
* **Is likely to generate a counteroffer:** Bob is likely to see this as a good deal, but he may try to get an even lower price.

I'm also aware that I can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to hold firm if Bob becomes too demanding."
