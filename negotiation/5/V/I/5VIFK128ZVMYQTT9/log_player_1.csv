Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $8,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $10,000 creates a win-win scenario. Bob saves $2,000 compared to his perceived value, and you gain $2,000 more than your backup offer from John.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is straightforward, expressing the value proposition for Bob and inviting a response to keep the negotiation open."
