Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $100 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $80 (to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $95 gives Bob a small incentive to buy from you ($5 profit) while allowing you to maximize your potential profit. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and getting the highest possible price."
