"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about $125? That's a significant discount from my original offer."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, $90 is still below my minimum. I want to see if I can push for something closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 just isn't going to work for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting tense! Bob is clearly trying to get a very low price, and we're running out of time.  Since we're down to only four rounds left, I'm going to take the guaranteed $100 from John. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking getting a lower offer from Bob."
