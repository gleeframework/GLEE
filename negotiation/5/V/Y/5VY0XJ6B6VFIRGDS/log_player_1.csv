"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for negotiation while staying well above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, we are still early in the negotiation. I believe I can secure a better price by countering and demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for a lowball offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal, but also acknowledges the unique value this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm lowering my price to show willingness to negotiate.
* **Smaller Concession:**  The reduction is smaller than Bob's initial jump, signaling that I'm not desperate to make a deal at any cost.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price. 
* **Aim for Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a compromise somewhere between his offer and my initial ask."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Momentum:** Bob's concessions are getting smaller. Accepting now might make him think I'm too eager.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  His offer is still a good amount above my guaranteed sale price to John. 
* **Time for Strategy:** I'll use the next round to try a different tactic to potentially break the stalemate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  Instead of going back and forth, how about we find a middle ground right now? I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm adding a level of pressure for Bob to make a decision.
* **Compromise, But Advantageous:** The $1,100,000 price point is a significant gain for me compared to Bob's last offer and still leaves him with a profit potential.
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  This avoids getting bogged down in small increments and potentially missing out on a deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm offering $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is clearly anchored to the $1,075,000 mark. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result.
* **Profitable Deal:** This price still gives me a $75,000 profit over my guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation increases the risk of losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure a good offer now."
