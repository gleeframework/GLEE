"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. However, $13,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,800. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",11800.0,Bob,4,
