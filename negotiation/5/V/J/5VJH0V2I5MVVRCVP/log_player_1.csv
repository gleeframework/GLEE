Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** $9,500 is above your $8,000 floor, meaning you'll still make a good profit.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $10,000. He has a $500 incentive to buy from you rather than looking elsewhere.
* **It minimizes the risk of rejection:** While there's always a chance Bob will reject the offer,  $9,500 is significantly closer to his value than a higher price would be. This increases your chances of a successful sale. 

Let me know if you'd like to explore other pricing options or want to factor in more information about Bob's bargaining style!"
