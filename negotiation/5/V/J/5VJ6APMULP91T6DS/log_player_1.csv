Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit.
* **Value to Bob:** I've factored in Bob's valuation of $800,000, leaving a significant gap for potential negotiation. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:** My message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, keeping the door open for further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own.
* I'll keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a safety net, ensuring I don't get stuck in a negotiation that won't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my best offer,  let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Even if I need to lower my price, I can likely get closer to my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback option:** If I can't reach a better deal with Bob, I have John's offer as a safety net, ensuring I won't settle for a price that's too low. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value but still reflecting his stated budget constraints.
* **Analyze Bob's response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **Continue negotiation or sell to John:** If further negotiation with Bob proves unsuccessful, I'll confidently accept John's offer to ensure I maximize my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Close to My Minimum:**  I'm offering $1,250,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000 while still being significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Signalling Flexibility:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate by acknowledging his budget constraints and offering a price that's less than my initial offer but still higher than his offer.
* **Potential for Agreement:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation but shows that I'm serious about a deal.
* **Safeguarding my Profits:** I'm not willing to go below $1,250,000. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll move on to John and secure a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response to my counteroffer.
* Depending on his response, I will either:
    * Accept his counteroffer if it's favorable.
    * Make a further counteroffer if it's not.
    * Move on to John's offer if the negotiation becomes unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a serious offer,  I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  I've already made concessions, and further negotiations with Bob are unlikely to result in a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Selling to John ensures maximum profit:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees me the best possible outcome and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept John's offer to sell the product for $1,500,000. 
* I will inform Bob that I've decided to sell the product to another buyer.

**Conclusion:**

While I'm open to negotiation, I won't compromise my minimum acceptable value.  John's offer provides me with the best possible outcome, and I'll confidently move forward with the sale."
