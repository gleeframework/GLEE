Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  This is a great price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum ($1,500,000), allowing for some give-and-take.
* **Positive language:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John.
*  The goal is to find the sweet spot where I maximize my profit while still securing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is a rejection, it signals his willingness to negotiate. I can likely get a higher price by countering.
* **John is a safety net:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer.

**Strategy:**

* I will make a counteroffer closer to my desired price,  keeping in mind that I can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** I'm starting my counteroffer significantly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also protects my minimum value.
* **Emphasize value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize why my counteroffer is still a good deal for him.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** My counteroffer is still negotiable, allowing for further discussion and compromise. 

**Strategy:**

* If Bob accepts, I secure a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John. 
* This approach aims to find a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest,  $1,200,000 is the highest I can go.  If that works for you, I'm ready to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $1,200,000 is still below my absolute minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation has stalled:**  Bob has made it clear that $1,200,000 is his final offer, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit. 

**Strategy:**

* There's little benefit to continuing negotiation with Bob, as he's unlikely to budge further.  
* Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* Selling to John ensures I meet my financial goals."
