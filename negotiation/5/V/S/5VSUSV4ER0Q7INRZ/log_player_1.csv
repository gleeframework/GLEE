Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price gradually while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that yet.  I'll try to get closer to my initial asking price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $15,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still gives me a decent profit. I hope Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is too low. While I could keep negotiating, the risk of further lowering the price and ending up with less than my minimum acceptable price is too high. It's better to sell to John and guarantee a profit of $12,000."
