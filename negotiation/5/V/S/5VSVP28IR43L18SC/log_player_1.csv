"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it allows me to buy the product within my budget and allows you to get closer to your desired price. Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still far from the $1,000,000 I can get from John. I will try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get a better price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875000. This is a good compromise for both of us, as it gets me closer to my budget and brings you closer to your desired price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $875,000 is a better offer than before, it's still significantly lower than the $1,000,000 I can get from John.  I've already made a concession, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to budge much further. To maximize my earnings, I'll sell the product to John."
