"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're beginning with a price significantly higher than our minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  We're not just throwing out a number; we're framing it as a fair offer due to the product's potential value. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While our goal is to get the best deal possible, we always have the option of going to John. This knowledge gives us confidence to start high and negotiate strategically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate and try to meet somewhere in the middle. Selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your business, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession by dropping $350,000 to show Bob we're serious about negotiating. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, our new price of $1,950,000 is still significantly above both his offer and our minimum.  We're aiming for a price that benefits both parties.
* **Justifying the Price:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price without being too aggressive. We want to keep the tone collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches our minimum acceptable price and the price John is willing to pay. There's no further room for negotiation without going below our minimum. Accepting this offer secures a good deal for us."
