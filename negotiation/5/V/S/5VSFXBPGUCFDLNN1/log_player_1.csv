Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still securing a great deal for Alice.
* **Consider the Alternative:** Offering a price too close to $800,000 (John's offer) gives Bob less incentive to agree.  

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the situation."
