Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm counteroffering the product at a price of $815,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while it's above our ideal price, it's a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000. Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away, leaving us with the less favorable alternative."
