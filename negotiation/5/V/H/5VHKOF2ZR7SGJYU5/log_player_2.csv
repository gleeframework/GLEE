"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $750,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Bob is starting the negotiation aggressively with a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal.
* **Reasonable Justification:**  Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Bob leaves the door open for further discussion by asking what Alice thinks."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $750,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice's offer of $850,000 is better than her initial offer, but it's still above Bob's ideal price point.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** Bob believes there's still room for negotiation, especially since Alice is willing to compromise.
* **Avoiding a Rush Decision:**  While John is an option, it's better to exhaust negotiation with Alice before committing to a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising Counteroffer:**  Bob is showing flexibility by meeting Alice halfway between their last offers.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  Bob highlights the ""fairness"" of the offer, appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Bob emphasizes the desire to reach an agreement, creating a sense of urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $825,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher to $860,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has declared this her final offer, meaning further negotiation might be futile.
* **Price Close to Goal:** While $860,000 is above Bob's ideal price, it's significantly lower than John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a decent price."
