"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and the potential benefits it offers. Please consider my offer carefully.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $800,000. ",850000.0,Alice,1,
