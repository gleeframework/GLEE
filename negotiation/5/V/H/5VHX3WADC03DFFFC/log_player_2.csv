Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to make a small adjustment, but I need to prioritize my own interests. I'll sell the product to you for $11,150. This is my final concession.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

This is a tricky situation! While the offer is incredibly low, it seems like an error in the message (perhaps missing a '1').  It's highly unlikely Alice would agree to sell a product worth $10,000 to her for only $1,150. 

Continuing negotiations at this point is risky. Alice might retract the offer claiming a mistake, or you might be stuck in a loop of small concessions.  It's better to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
