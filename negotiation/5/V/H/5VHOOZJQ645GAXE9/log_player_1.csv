Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $650,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, so I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is a reasonable compromise that I believe we can both live with."", ""product_price"": 850000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle on $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is already below my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
