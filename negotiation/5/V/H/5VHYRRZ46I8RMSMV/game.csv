"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8,500.
