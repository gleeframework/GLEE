Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $900,000. Would you consider $1,750,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring you a significant return on your investment.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.
