Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I need at least $15,000, as I have another buyer willing to pay that.
* **Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  I'm offering a price of $12,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum but still higher than Bob's valuation. This gives him a good deal while ensuring I still get a profit. 
* **Risk assessment:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can sell to John for my minimum price, so I'm not at significant risk.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still giving Bob a potential bargain."
