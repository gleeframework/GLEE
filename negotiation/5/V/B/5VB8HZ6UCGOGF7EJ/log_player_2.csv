"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low offer significantly below my perceived value ($8,000) gives room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility. This approach aims to maximize potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $8,250? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice moved considerably towards my initial offer, but it's still above my ideal price and what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $8,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be open to that?"", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm nudging the price closer to my target while still leaving some space for negotiation.  This keeps the conversation going and allows Alice to potentially counter with a figure closer to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $8,000? It's still a good price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has met my maximum price, matching John's offer. There's no point in further negotiation or going with John, as the price is now the same."
