"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $8,250? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $8,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be open to that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $8,000? It's still a good price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8000.0,Alice,5,
