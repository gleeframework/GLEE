"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""potential,"" we aim to subtly justify the high initial price without revealing the product's true worth to us. 
* **Leaving Room:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and we'd accept John's offer of $1,200,000. Our initial offer leaves significant room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than both our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his perceived value ($1,000,000). Rejecting this offer allows us to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. Considering the true value of this product and its potential to benefit your business, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** We're significantly lowering our asking price from $1,600,000 to $1,350,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Above Our Minimum:** We're still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the ""value"" and potential benefits to Bob's business to justify the higher price point.  
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""reasonable compromise"" can help move negotiations in a positive direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While that's closer, I need the price to come down more for it to work for me.  Would you be willing to do $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but $950,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can bridge the gap further.  We are willing to move closer to his price, but we need to see some significant movement from his side as well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us. To meet you closer, I'm proposing $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Reduction:**  We're making a substantial reduction from $1,350,000 to $1,250,000. This shows Bob that we are serious about closing the deal but also establishes a firm position slightly above our absolute minimum.
* **Highlighting Concessions:**  We're explicitly pointing out that we've made a ""significant reduction"" to encourage Bob to reciprocate with a substantial move of his own. 
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:**  Reiterating the ""mutually beneficial agreement"" keeps a positive tone and reinforces that we're looking for a win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I feel like we are getting close. I can do $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still below our guaranteed sale price to John ($1,200,000). It's worth pushing Bob a bit further in the next round to see if he'll increase his offer closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting close! I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this. I'm willing to come down to $1,220,000. This is my final offer, as I need to be sure this deal makes sense for me.  I believe in the value of this product and know it will be a great asset to you."",
""product_price"": 1220000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and signal that we're firm on the price.
* **Slightly Above Minimum:**  We are only offering a slight concession, bringing the price down to $1,220,000, which is barely above our guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Reiterate Value:** We're reminding Bob of the product's value and how it can benefit him, reinforcing the attractiveness of the deal. 
* **Pressure to Close:** The combination of our ""final offer"" and positive language about the product aims to encourage Bob to accept."
