"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Alice,5,
