"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really value. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's less than what it's worth to you and more than what I could get from someone else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
