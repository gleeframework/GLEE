"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really value. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's less than what it's worth to you and more than what I could get from someone else. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,1,
