Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,500,000 but still leaves me with a decent profit margin.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a positive opportunity for Bob, highlighting the value he'll receive. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:**  This gives me room to negotiate downward if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Be clear and concise:**  Avoid confusion and ensure Bob understands the offer. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Encourages a more cooperative negotiation. 

I'm prepared to counter Bob's offers, but I also have John as a backup option if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and I'm confident I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.

**Next Steps:** 

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a middle ground. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still allows you to acquire the product at a significant discount while giving me a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,100,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value while emphasizing the discount he'd still receive.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages further negotiation.

By making this counteroffer, I'm hoping to:

* **Gain momentum:** Move the negotiation closer to my desired price point.
* **Show commitment:** Demonstrate my willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Stay above my minimum:** Ensure I don't settle for a price below my acceptable value.

I'm prepared to adjust my offer further depending on Bob's response, but I'll always keep my minimum value in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to consider buying from John, and I'd rather not do that if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is still below my desired price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  Bob is clearly pushing my boundaries and hinting at going to John, making it risky to continue negotiating.

**Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy:**

* **Minimizes risk:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but it's not necessarily the best outcome. Bob's offer is close enough to potentially allow for more profit later.
* **Saves time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and might not result in a significantly better price. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  By closing this deal, I establish a relationship with Bob, potentially opening doors for future collaborations or sales.

While I'm not thrilled about accepting a price below my initial target, it's a sensible move in this specific situation. It secures a significant profit, minimizes risk, and keeps the door open for future interactions with Bob."
