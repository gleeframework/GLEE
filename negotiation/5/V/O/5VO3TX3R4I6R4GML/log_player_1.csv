Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,050,000.  This price still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's work together to get this done."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my desired price,  $975,000 is a good deal considering the limited rounds left and the potential of losing to John. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
