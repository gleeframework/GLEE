"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, I'm looking to spend less than $1 million. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to stay under $1 million. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $950,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
