Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a better deal if he counters.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, I'm subtly reminding Bob of its worth without explicitly stating it's worth less to me.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is suggestive rather than demanding, indicating I'm open to discussing the price.
* **Backup Plan:** Since I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, I can afford to start high with Bob and potentially make a larger profit."
