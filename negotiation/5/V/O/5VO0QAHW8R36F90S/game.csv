"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little lower.  Let's try $8,750.  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $8,750 is close, but I need to get at least $8,900 for it to make sense for me.  I'm confident this is a fair price for the value you'll be getting.",8900.0,Alice,5,
