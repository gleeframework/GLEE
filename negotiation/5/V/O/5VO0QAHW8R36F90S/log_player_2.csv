"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $8,000.  There's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to get as close to his desired price of $8,000 as possible. This counteroffer is a strong starting point, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** A $1,000 reduction from Alice's initial price is a reasonable counteroffer, showing Bob is serious about buying but also looking for a better deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message expresses willingness to negotiate further, inviting Alice to respond and potentially find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Value:**  While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $8,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice is already willing to compromise, so there's likely more room for a better deal.
* **Avoid Rushing:**  There are still 7 rounds remaining, which is plenty of time to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to Bob's target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little lower.  Let's try $8,750.  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** This offer is halfway between Bob's previous counteroffer ($8,500) and Alice's latest offer ($9,000).
* **Compromise Language:** The message highlights the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Alice's sense of fairness and potentially increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Still Below Target:** While it's not Bob's ideal price, it remains below Alice's minimum acceptable price and keeps negotiations moving towards his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $8,750 is close, but I need to get at least $8,900 for it to make sense for me.  I'm confident this is a fair price for the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $8,900 is very close to Bob's ideal value of $8,000. The deal is getting very favorable for Bob.
* **Limited Time:**  There are only 5 rounds remaining, and going lower might risk Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but it's possible further rounds will result in more back-and-forth, potentially leading to a deadlock or the need to buy from John.  Accepting this offer minimizes the risk and secures a good deal."
