Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $11,500 offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, still landing you above your minimum.

**Important:**  It's crucial to convey the product's value to Bob in your message. Highlighting its features, benefits, and the potential loss of not buying it now can influence his decision."
