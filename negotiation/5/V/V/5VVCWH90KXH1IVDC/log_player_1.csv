Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think it's fair considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the product's worth to Bob, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to respond and potentially start a counter-offer. 

This approach allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  I start high, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** I'm prepared to adjust the price if Bob counter-offers, but I'm also willing to walk away if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome. 
* **Maintain a positive relationship:** By being friendly and open to negotiation, I avoid creating a hostile bargaining environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, as it would mean a substantial financial loss.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $8,200, I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's find a middle ground to make this work."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm presenting a counter-offer that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I again reiterate the value of the product to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefit.
* **Negotiation Focus:** I'm aiming to establish a middle ground, encouraging further negotiation and increasing the chances of a mutually beneficial agreement.

This approach balances the need to secure a reasonable price while keeping the negotiation open for a potential deal."
