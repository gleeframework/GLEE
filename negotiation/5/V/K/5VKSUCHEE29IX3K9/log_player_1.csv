"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the value. Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so hopefully, he'll be willing to negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a significant amount, it's still below my target. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,300,000. This is still a good price for Bob, and it brings us closer to my desired price. Hopefully, he'll be more willing to negotiate at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and keep negotiating. There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,250,000.  I'm trying to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm running out of time, and there's no guarantee that Bob will come up any higher. To avoid risking getting a lower price or ending up with no deal at all, I'm going to sell to John. He's offering my minimum price, which is still a good outcome for me."
