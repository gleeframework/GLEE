"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm not going for the full $1,500,000 right away to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving open the possibility of a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I have 8 rounds left. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I want to explore all options with Bob before resorting to that.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and have the opportunity to propose a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $1,750,000 to $1,450,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that my price is still fair.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground, demonstrating flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1,300,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $1,300,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation continues:**  We're still in the early stages of the negotiation, and I believe there's potential for Bob to come up a bit more.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:**  While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'm determined to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I continue to push for a higher price, keeping my options open and the negotiation alive."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to my asking price. Would you consider $1,400,000?

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm again meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $1,450,000 to $1,400,000. This shows continued flexibility without compromising my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of the offer.
* **Bridging the gap:**  The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider my offer to reach a mutually agreeable price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $1,325,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Time is running out:** While time is a factor, I'm not ready to settle for a price that's significantly less than my desired minimum. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  We've had some back and forth, and I believe Bob may be willing to increase his offer slightly. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and leave room for further negotiation.  I'm still hopeful that we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to my asking price. Let's try $1,375,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. We're getting closer, let's see if we can seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm raising my offer slightly from $1,325,000 to $1,375,000, showing willingness to compromise. This is still a significant distance from my ideal price, but I believe it's a realistic compromise at this stage.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my offer.
* **Positive Language:** The message is positive and encouraging, aiming to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's more attractive to Bob while still ensuring I get a price that's closer to my desired minimum. The negotiation is getting tighter, and I need to make a move that feels fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $1,275,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're down to our last two rounds. 
* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,275,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  I'm not confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids any further risk of losing out on a better deal. 

While I would have preferred to negotiate with Bob to potentially get a higher price, the pressure of time and the uncertainty of reaching a mutually agreeable price have forced me to make the decision to sell to John."
