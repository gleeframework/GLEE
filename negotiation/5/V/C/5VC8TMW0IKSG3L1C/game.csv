"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can't afford to spend more than $8,000 on this product. Would you consider lowering the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth to me. To be fair, I can offer it to you for $10,000.  This is still a good price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture, I'm still unable to meet at $10,000. Could you possibly reconsider and come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
