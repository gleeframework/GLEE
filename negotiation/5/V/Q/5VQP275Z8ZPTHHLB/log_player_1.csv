"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll try to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I need a price closer to $15,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $13,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $13,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than my minimum. I will make a counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $13,000 is still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $14,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll counter with $13,500 again. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $13,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than my minimum. I will make another counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my target. I'm also starting to consider selling to John since I'm getting closer to my deadline."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but $13,500 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession. If you can meet me at $14,500, I'll close the deal. It's the best I can do. If not, I might have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $14,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $13,750. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, it's time to be realistic.  Bob's offer of $13,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could make another counteroffer, it's unlikely Bob will meet my price. Given my deadline and the certainty of John's offer, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $15,000."
