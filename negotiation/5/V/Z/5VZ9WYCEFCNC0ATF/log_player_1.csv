Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to acquire this unique and valuable product.  Given its exceptional qualities, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm willing to pay a premium for this product. However, I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
We're still significantly above Bob's valuation and have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can nudge him closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly unique. I could meet you halfway between our two offers. What do you say to $1,075,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a strong outcome. It exceeds our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal by pushing Bob too far."
