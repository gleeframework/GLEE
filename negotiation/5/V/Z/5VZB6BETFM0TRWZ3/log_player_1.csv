"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:** $18,000 allows for some room to come down in price without going below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he acknowledges the product's value and is open to negotiation. This suggests there's room to find a compromise.
* **Exploring Counteroffers:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer and explore if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. 

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is far below the product's true value. To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a price of $13,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $13,000 represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Value:**  $13,000 is still a reasonable price for Bob, as it's above his stated budget but below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget of $10,000. Could we possibly come to an agreement around $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it still falls short. Accepting it would mean a significant loss.
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** I have only had 4 rounds of negotiations and there are 6 rounds remaining. This gives me ample opportunity to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Potential for John:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $12,500? It's a good deal for both of us, and it brings us closer to a final agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $12,500 is exactly halfway between my last offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This demonstrates my commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $12,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's a significant concession that shows I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly emphasizing the need for a decision by saying ""Let me know what you think.""  This encourages Bob to respond and potentially accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort in negotiating. I would like to propose a price of $11,500 for the product. This brings us closer to my budget while still being fair to you. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it still falls short. Accepting it would result in a significant loss. 
* **Negotiation Still Possible:**  We've only had 6 rounds of negotiations, and there are still 4 rounds remaining. This gives me more time to try and secure a better price.
* **John is a Safe Option:** If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. 

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is still too low for me.  We've both made compromises, and I'm willing to go a little further. How about we settle on $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us and brings us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** My counteroffer of $12,000 is a final compromise, representing a significant concession from my previous offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Progress:** I emphasize the compromises made by both of us to highlight the progress we've made in the negotiation.
* **Urgency:** I use the phrase ""Let's see if we can reach an agreement"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts in negotiating. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This brings us closer to my budget while still being fair to you. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are in round 8, with only 2 rounds remaining. 
* **Low Offer:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's unlikely that further negotiation will result in a deal that meets my requirements.
* **Guaranteed Deal:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my price point. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed deal with John than to risk losing time and potentially getting a worse deal with Bob."
