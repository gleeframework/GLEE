Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering it at $100 leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the value Bob places on it. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** You have a backup buyer willing to pay $80, ensuring you won't go below your minimum.

This strategy balances potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
