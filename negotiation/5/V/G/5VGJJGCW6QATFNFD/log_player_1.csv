Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  This gives you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This shows you're open to a deal, but also protects your minimum profit. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145?  I'm confident you'll find this to be a good value."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I've already rejected his previous offer and a counteroffer at $130 doesn't feel like it's going to get me any closer to a deal.  John's offer is guaranteed, and it's worth more than Bob's current offer. I'll take the sure thing and sell the product to John."
