Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 allows a small buffer for potential negotiation with Bob, while still aiming for a high price.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  Mentioning a ""special price"" subtly implies the offer might not last, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's no guarantee Bob will accept the offer. If Bob rejects it, Alice still has the safety net of selling to John for $120."
