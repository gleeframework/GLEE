"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I could consider $1,325,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to see some more flexibility on the price to make this work for me. How about $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we're still significantly above our fallback option with John. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get closer to $1,250,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and call it a deal at $1,212,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,212,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,212,500

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is now above our fallback price with John. While we could potentially push for a bit more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob could walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good profit."
