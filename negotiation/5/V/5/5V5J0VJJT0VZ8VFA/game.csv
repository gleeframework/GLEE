"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to pay closer to the product's true value. I'm happy to pay $7500 for it. This is a fair price considering your own valuation, and it gives us both a chance to make a good deal.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. Considering the product's worth to me is $8000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $8250. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8250 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to offer $8000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8000. As I mentioned earlier, the product is worth $8000 to me, and I'm not willing to give it away. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering it to you for $8100. This is a reasonable price, considering the value it holds for me.",8100.0,Alice,5,
