You're willing to pay $100, which is the same price John is offering. You're essentially saying ""take it or leave it"" and see if Alice is willing to meet you at your price."

Alice is not budging from her price, and while you could continue to negotiate, it's clear she's not willing to meet your price.  At this point, it's better to take the safe option and buy from John."
