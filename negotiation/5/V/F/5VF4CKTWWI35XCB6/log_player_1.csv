Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us.  This is my best price, as the product is worth significantly more to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There is still a substantial gap between my starting price and Bob's perceived value, allowing for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:** My message highlights the value of the product to me, making the price seem more justified.
* **The John Factor:**  The presence of John as an alternative buyer gives me leverage and means I don't need to accept a lowball offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have leverage with John's offer as a backup. This allows me to push for a better price without feeling pressured to accept a low offer. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially securing a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is simply too far below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you.  This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** My counter-offer is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but still maintaining a reasonable price.
* **Fairness and Compromise:** The message emphasizes a fair compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify my price, subtly reminding Bob of its worth. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and encouraging, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $900,000, which would be $850,000, but I'm willing to go even lower to $825,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **No further negotiation:**  Bob has declared this his final offer, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price I find acceptable.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** John is a sure buyer at $1,000,000, guaranteeing a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting a lower price or no deal at all."
