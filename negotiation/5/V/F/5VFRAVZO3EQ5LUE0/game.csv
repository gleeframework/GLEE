"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome. Let's make this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and I respect the value of your product. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1,250,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,150,000. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
