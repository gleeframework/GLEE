"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $80 to Bob, and Alice's offer is too high. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
``` 

Bob should start by offering a significantly lower price, about half of Alice's original price. This shows his seriousness in negotiating while leaving room for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is a slight improvement, it's still above Bob's maximum value. He should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
``` 

Bob should increase his offer, but not too much. This shows he's willing to compromise but also keeps the pressure on Alice to reduce her price.  $70 is a good compromise point, as it's closer to Alice's last offer but still within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Although Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, it's still above his budget. Bob should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

Bob should increase his offer again, showing a willingness to compromise.  $75 is a good middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's current offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his preferred price. There's a chance Alice will lower her offer further, and Bob can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

This is the last counteroffer Bob should make.  He's offering his maximum price, and it's time to see if Alice will accept.  If she rejects this offer, Bob should buy from John, as it's unlikely he'll get a better price from Alice."
