"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
