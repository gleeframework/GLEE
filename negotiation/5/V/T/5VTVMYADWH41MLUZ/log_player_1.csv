Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give the product away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,250, which would be $9,875. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and try one more counteroffer. If he doesn't budge, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting a bit frustrated with this back and forth.  I'm firm on my price of $10,000. I'm not going to go any lower. It's a good deal for you, and if we don't come to an agreement, I'll have to go with another buyer.  Think about it, $10,000 for a product you value at $10,000 is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}
