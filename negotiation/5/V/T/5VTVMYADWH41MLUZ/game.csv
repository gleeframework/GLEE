"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make this happen.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,250, which would be $9,875. Can you consider that?",9875.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting a bit frustrated with this back and forth.  I'm firm on my price of $10,000. I'm not going to go any lower. It's a good deal for you, and if we don't come to an agreement, I'll have to go with another buyer.  Think about it, $10,000 for a product you value at $10,000 is a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,5,
