"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, considering the market value and my own financial constraints. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for on the market.
