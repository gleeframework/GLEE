"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking of offering $10000. Can you meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and $12000. How about we try $13500? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great value for the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $13500. How about we try $11750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession, though. How about we try $13250? It's still a good value for the product, and I think it's a fair price considering its worth.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $13250. How about we try $11625?",11625.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $13000? It's still a good value for the product, and I think it's a fair price considering its worth.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your minimum price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11625 and $13000. How about we try $12312.50?",12312.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $13000, Bob. I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to compromise further. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement at this point.",13000.0,Alice,9,
