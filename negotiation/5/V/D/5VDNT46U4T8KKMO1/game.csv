"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to stay closer to my budget. Would you consider $10,500? This is a fair price that allows me to buy the product without overextending myself, and it's still above your own value for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about staying within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my original price. I'm proposing a new offer of $11,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product to you, while also recognizing my own investment. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm comfortable paying $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal, considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can agree on this final price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is your final offer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm proposing a new offer of $12,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12250.0,Alice,5,
