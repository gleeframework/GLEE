"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $10,000. You have room to negotiate further. By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about staying within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my original price. I'm proposing a new offer of $11,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product to you, while also recognizing my own investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above your target price. It's closer to your ideal price than before, but you still have room to negotiate. You have the option of buying from John for $10,000, so there's no need to settle for a price you're not comfortable with.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is your final offer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm proposing a new offer of $12,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,250 is still significantly higher than your target price of $10,000. You've already tried to negotiate and reached a point where further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better price.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $10,000. You'll save $2,250 compared to Alice's offer and avoid further negotiation."
