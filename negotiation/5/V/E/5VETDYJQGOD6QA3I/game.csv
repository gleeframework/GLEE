"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try one more time.  I'm willing to drop the price to $8,900, which is closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8800.0,Bob,6,
