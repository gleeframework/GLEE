"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above $1050000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the terms. I'd like to discuss the possibility of a discount or an additional benefit if I purchase the product within a certain timeframe. Let's say, if I pay within 30 days, could we discuss a 1% discount?",1050000.0,Bob,6,,

"Dear Bob, thank you for your thoughtful proposal regarding the payment terms. I understand your desire for flexibility and appreciate your commitment to purchasing our product. In light of this, I am willing to offer a 1% discount if the payment is made within 30 days. However, I would also like to suggest including a complimentary service package valued at $10000 as part of the deal. This would bring the total price to $1050000, making it a complete and attractive package for you. I believe this proposal strikes a good balance between our interests. I look forward to your feedback.",1050000.0,Alice,7,,Complimentary service package valued at $10000
