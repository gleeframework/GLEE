"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits you'll gain from it. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I'm trying to be fair, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $930,000 as a final offer. This price is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial in the long run. If you're still not able to meet this price, I'll have to consider other options.",930000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $930,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $800,000.",900000.0,Bob,6,
