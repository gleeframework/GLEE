{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,000,000 is higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, but it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You've left some wiggle room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits you'll gain from it. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I'm trying to be fair, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is getting close to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $930,000 as a final offer. This price is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial in the long run. If you're still not able to meet this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 930000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $930,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While $900,000 is close to my minimum, Bob is now firmly stating his final offer, and I'm not convinced there's much more room for negotiation. It's time to move on and secure the higher price from John."
