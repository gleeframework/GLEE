"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly special, and I believe it has immense value for the right buyer. My asking price is $2000000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can we meet in the middle at $1800000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. While $1800000 is closer to my initial asking price, it's still a bit lower than what I feel this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1900000, reflecting a compromise from both sides. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1900000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1500000 and $1900000, which would be $1700000. Can we consider that price?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1700000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to make a final concession. Let's settle on $1800000. This price reflects a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while respecting your budget. What do you say?",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1500000 and $1800000, which would be $1650000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
