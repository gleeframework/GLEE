"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $13,000. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $14,500. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",14500.0,Alice,5,
