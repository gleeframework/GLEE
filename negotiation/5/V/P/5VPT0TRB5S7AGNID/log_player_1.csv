"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to get as much of Bob's value as possible while leaving room for negotiation. This offer is significantly above my minimum, giving Bob incentive to engage and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial proposal, showing he's trying to negotiate aggressively. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying well above my minimum. This shows Bob I'm serious about a deal, but I'm not desperate to sell for his initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, but I'm not ready to sell for that price yet.  While selling to John is a safe option, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter in the next round, but I'm starting to get concerned about the dwindling number of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This is a significant concession on my part, but it's the last one I'm willing to make.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, and with only 5 rounds left, the pressure is on to close a deal.  This price still gives Bob a good deal, considering his perceived value of the product, while also securing a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but we're running out of time.  I've made several concessions and it's unlikely he'll budge much further.  With only 4 rounds left, it's too risky to keep negotiating.  While I would prefer to get a bit more than $1,000,000, selling to John guarantees a solid profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
