"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
