Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get from another buyer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message:** This is friendly and emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. It also subtly reminds Bob of the alternative buyer (John) to encourage a quick decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to push for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000:** This is a compromise price, offering a small discount from my initial offer but still leaving a significant profit margin.
* **The message:** I reiterate that Bob's initial offer is too low, while also emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.  I present the counteroffer as a reasonable middle ground."
