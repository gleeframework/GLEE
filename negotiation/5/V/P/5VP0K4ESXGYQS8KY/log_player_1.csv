Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product has tremendous value for you, given your expertise in [mention Bob's relevant expertise]. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000, a significant discount from its true market value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for a profit, and this price gives you a decent margin.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This makes the offer attractive to Bob and creates room for negotiation. 
* **The message highlights Bob's potential benefit:**  This personalizes the offer and emphasizes the value the product brings to Bob specifically. 

Remember, this is just the first step in the negotiation. Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response and consider the potential of a deal with John if negotiations with Bob don't lead to an acceptable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering my budget constraints and the fact that I am looking for the best value for my investment, I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation and we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your desired minimum:**  While it's closer to your minimum of $800,000, it's still not profitable enough for you.
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate. You have leverage to try and push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is your backup:** If you can't reach an acceptable price with Bob, you always have the option of selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price that's higher than his offer, but still below your initial offer of $1,200,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better deal. You could propose something like:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $950,000 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still allows me to achieve my financial goals. I'm confident that this price offers significant value for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $950,000 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still allows me to achieve my financial goals. I'm confident that this price offers significant value for you, considering the unique benefits this product brings to your operations. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise, but with a clear justification:** The counteroffer is lower than your initial offer but still higher than Bob's.  The message clarifies your reasoning for the price and emphasizes the product's value to Bob.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  The closing sentence emphasizes the goal of finding a mutually beneficial solution, keeping the negotiation positive. 

By taking this approach, you show flexibility while maintaining a firm stance on your desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and the value you see in the product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product. This price still allows me to stay within my budget while providing a fair return for you. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your desired profit:** $1,000,000 is very close to your minimum target of $800,000, resulting in a significant profit.
* **Bob is willing to compromise:** He increased his offer from $950,000, showing that he's open to negotiation.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If you reject his offer and make a counteroffer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and you'll be left with the lower price from John. 

**Conclusion:**

While you might want a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
