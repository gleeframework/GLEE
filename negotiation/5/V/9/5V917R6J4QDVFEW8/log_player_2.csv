The product is too expensive at $18,000. It's better to counteroffer or buy from John."

I'm starting with a lowball offer of $10,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still above my absolute limit of $12,000. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high.  I'll try another counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."

I'm increasing my offer to $11,500. This is closer to my limit of $12,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to meet me halfway."
