Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to engage in a discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is still a significant profit for me and hopefully will be more appealing to Bob than his initial $10,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable value.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation."
