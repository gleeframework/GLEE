"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1400000. I would like to propose an alternative that might work for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to $1300000? I believe this could still provide a good return for you while allowing me to make the purchase within my financial limits.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. While I appreciate the effort to reach a compromise, I must respectfully decline. My maximum budget remains at $1250000. I understand that this may not meet your expectations, but I hope we can find a way to move forward. If you're willing to go down to $1250000, I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1250000. It's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $1290000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to move forward. If not, I'll need to consider other options.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
