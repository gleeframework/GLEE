"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,400,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:** Alice's offer is still above her minimum selling price of $1,200,000, indicating there is room for negotiation. 
* **Counter-offering is better than buying from John:** You can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice than by buying from John at $1,500,000."

# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for.
