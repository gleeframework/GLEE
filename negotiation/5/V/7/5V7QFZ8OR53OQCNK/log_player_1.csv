Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $15,000 gives Bob the impression that it's highly valuable while leaving room for potential negotiation. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob directly might be faster than waiting for John, so a slightly higher price is justified. 

**Important:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the price."
