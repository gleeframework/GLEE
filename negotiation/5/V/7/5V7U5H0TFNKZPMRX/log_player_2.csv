Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above my desired price point. I'm aiming to save as much as possible, and there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,150,000, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,100,000? This would be a fair price that allows us both to get what we want."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make another concession, Bob. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1,180,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its value to you and my own needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,180,000. This is still a good price for me, as it's below my maximum budget of $1,200,000 and is closer to my desired price range. While I could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a lower price, it's possible Alice won't budge further. It's also worth considering that we've already had 4 rounds of negotiations, and there's a chance we won't be able to reach a deal if I continue rejecting offers. Accepting this offer will allow me to secure the product at a good price and avoid the risk of losing it or having to buy it from John at a higher price."
