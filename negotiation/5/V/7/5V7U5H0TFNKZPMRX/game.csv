"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of our interests.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,150,000, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,100,000? This would be a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make another concession, Bob. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1,180,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its value to you and my own needs.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
