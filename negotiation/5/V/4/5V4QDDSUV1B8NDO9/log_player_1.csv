I'm starting with an offer of $1,300,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects, but I'm hoping he sees the value and accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to his value and shows I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will be more agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower. John is offering me my minimum value, and it's time to close the deal."
