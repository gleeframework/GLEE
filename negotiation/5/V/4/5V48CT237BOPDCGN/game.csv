"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the value of the product for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the willingness to come down from $1,400,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000.
