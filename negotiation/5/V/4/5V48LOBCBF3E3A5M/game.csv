"Thanks for the offer, Alice! $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $9,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to go with John if we can't reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
