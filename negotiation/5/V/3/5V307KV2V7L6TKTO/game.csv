"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,500, which I believe is fair considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",11500.0,Alice,3,
