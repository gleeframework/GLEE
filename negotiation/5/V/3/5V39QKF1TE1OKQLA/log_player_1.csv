Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you. "",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **50% Markup:**  A starting price of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup. While this is significant, it's within the realm of negotiation, especially if the product's value to Bob is truly $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and your belief in the offered price.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response and any counter-offers he might present."
