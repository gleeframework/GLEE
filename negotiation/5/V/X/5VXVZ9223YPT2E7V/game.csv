"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see that you're willing to pay $1050000, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1075000. This is my final compromise, what do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
