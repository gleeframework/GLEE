"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $920,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than $900,000.  While Alice is willing to meet halfway,  $920,000 is still too high. Bob will try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're both trying to find a deal that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, $920,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $900,000, which is my absolute minimum, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her minimum of $900,000. Bob has already countered down to $875,000, and he's not sure how much further he can go without risking losing the deal.  He knows that buying from John would cost him $1,000,000.  It's likely that Alice won't budge much further, so accepting the offer at $900,000 is the most practical choice to get the product at a price that's still within his budget."
