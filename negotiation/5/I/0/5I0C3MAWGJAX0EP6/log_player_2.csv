"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both your maximum price and her product valuation. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility. It's essential to appear serious about the purchase while aiming for a price closer to her product valuation ($12,000)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating, which is a good sign. While she came down $1,000, the price is still above your target and her product valuation. Continued negotiation might lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counter-offer aims to find a compromise.  It shows willingness to move closer to Alice's price while still staying under your $12,000 target.
* **Fairness emphasis:**  Phrasing like ""meet in the middle"" and ""fair compromise"" can encourage a sense of collaboration and agreement. 
* **Leaving room to negotiate:** While this is a reasonable offer, it leaves some wiggle room if Alice pushes back a bit further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting very close to her valuation of the product. We are also getting near the end of the negotiation rounds. We should make a final push to try and get a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've come down quite a bit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to stretch my budget and offer $12,100 as my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can close the deal."",
""product_price"": 12100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  It's time to signal that this is the best you can do. By saying ""final offer"" you're letting Alice know it's decision time. 
* **Slight Increase:**  The offer of $12,100 is a small increase from your previous, showing you're willing to compromise but not willing to go as high as $12,500.
* **Emphasis on Fairness and Closing:**  By reiterating fairness and your desire to ""close the deal"", you're appealing to Alice's desire for a successful negotiation as well."
