"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try negotiating for a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:**  It acknowledges Alice's offer and doesn't immediately shut it down.
* **Signals willingness to negotiate:** By making a counter-offer, I show Alice that I'm interested but want a better price.
* **Starts at a reasonable point:** $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a decent profit margin for her (considering her valuation of $8,000).

I'll see how Alice responds to this counter-offer before deciding my next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down slightly, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000, and I'm willing to risk another counter-offer to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

Here's why this counter-offer makes sense:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:**  By suggesting a split, I demonstrate to Alice that I'm flexible and looking for a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Approaches my target price:** $10,000 is the price point I'm aiming for, and this counter-offer puts us right on target.
* **Maintains a polite and respectful tone:**  Continuing to use friendly language will hopefully encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly anchoring to her initial offers. While I'd prefer a price closer to $10,000, $11,500 is still a reasonable price, and significantly lower than John's $15,000 offer. It's time to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
