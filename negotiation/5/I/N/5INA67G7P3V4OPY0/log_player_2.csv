"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $850,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
