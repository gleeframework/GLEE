Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, so I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price is a significant step forward for me and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $950,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether. It's better to take a sure $950,000 than risk getting nothing or settling for John's offer later."
