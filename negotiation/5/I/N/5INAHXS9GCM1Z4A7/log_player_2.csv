"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is too high for Bob's budget. It's better to reject and counteroffer, trying to negotiate a lower price.  There are still rounds available, and Bob might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target price. He can still try to negotiate a lower price, and he has multiple rounds left. It's worth exploring whether Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to this deal.  Let's try to find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I'm motivated to close this deal, but need to be realistic about the product's worth. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $975,000 is still above Bob's target budget.  He's only got a few rounds left, but with some strategic counter-offering, he may be able to reach a more favorable price. There's still potential to get closer to his target of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, so I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price is a significant step forward for me and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
