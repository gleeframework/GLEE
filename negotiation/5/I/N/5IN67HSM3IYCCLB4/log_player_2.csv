It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $100 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to go down to $75? "", ""product_price"": 75}
```"

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

$85 is still a bit high, but it's a good sign Alice is willing to negotiate. I'm going to try to get closer to my target of $75."
