"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to  $600,000 would be more reasonable."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution. How about we meet halfway and settle on $850,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal happen while still recognizing the inherent value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $700,000? That would make this a much easier decision for me."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $700,000 is getting closer, but I still need to ensure this deal makes sense for me.  Would you be willing to consider $775,000? This feels like a fair compromise where we both concede a bit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down, we're getting close to John's price. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get the price lower than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer.  I'd be willing to go up to $725,000, but that's really my limit.  What do you say?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. Let's make this final push for a deal.  If you're able to meet me at $750,000, we can close this out today.  This truly represents my bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is signaling this is her bottom line.  While we might be able to squeeze a little more in another round, it's unlikely to be a significant difference.  Accepting at $750,000 secures a decent discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
