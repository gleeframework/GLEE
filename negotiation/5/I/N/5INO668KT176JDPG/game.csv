"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to  $600,000 would be more reasonable.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution. How about we meet halfway and settle on $850,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal happen while still recognizing the inherent value of what's being offered.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $700,000? That would make this a much easier decision for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $700,000 is getting closer, but I still need to ensure this deal makes sense for me.  Would you be willing to consider $775,000? This feels like a fair compromise where we both concede a bit.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  I'd be willing to go up to $725,000, but that's really my limit.  What do you say?",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. Let's make this final push for a deal.  If you're able to meet me at $750,000, we can close this out today.  This truly represents my bottom line.",750000.0,Alice,7,
