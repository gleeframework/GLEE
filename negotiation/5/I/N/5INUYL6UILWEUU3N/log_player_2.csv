"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:** 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, there's no benefit to negotiating with Alice.  Buying from John ensures you get the product at your maximum price point."
