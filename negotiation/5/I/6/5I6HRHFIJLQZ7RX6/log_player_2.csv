"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $200 is far above your maximum budget of $120. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum price point. It's unlikely Alice will accept this right away, but it establishes a clear starting point for negotiation and shows I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $200 might have been a little high, but $120 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $160 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to my maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $140. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing flexibility.  $140 is a compromise point - it's still below my maximum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
