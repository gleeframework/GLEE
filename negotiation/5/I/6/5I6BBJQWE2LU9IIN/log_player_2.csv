"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe you'll find great value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is a bit less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price. If Alice really wants to sell to you, she might be willing to come down a little. If not, you can always fall back on buying from John for $100."
