Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, which is a fair price for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
