,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do 115 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but my absolute maximum is $105. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy. ",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 105 is your absolute maximum, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can do 110 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit outside my budget.  If you're willing to come down to $108, I'm ready to buy right now.  Let me know what you think.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as 108. I can do 112 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",112.0,Alice,7,
