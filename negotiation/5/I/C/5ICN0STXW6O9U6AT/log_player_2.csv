Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do 115 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but my absolute maximum is $105. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy. "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 105 is your absolute maximum, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can do 110 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate further or buy from John.  It's worth noting that Alice seems to be using the ""meet in the middle"" tactic, which can be effective in negotiations, but Bob needs to stay firm to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit outside my budget.  If you're willing to come down to $108, I'm ready to buy right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as 108. I can do 112 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice is clearly unwilling to go lower than $112, which is above Bob's desired price point.  John offers a guaranteed lower price of $100, making him the better option at this point."
