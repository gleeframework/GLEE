"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than Bob's perceived value, making him likely to counter.
* **Shows you're serious:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum, demonstrating you want to make a deal with him. 
* **Sets the tone for a fair negotiation:**  It's a reasonable first offer that invites Bob to respond in kind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'm open to negotiating, it's too low at this point. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this work for me. How about $875,000?  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given your offer."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still feel that $875,000 is quite high. I would like to stick to my original proposal of $750,000. However, if you could meet me halfway, say at $825,000, I'd be willing to consider that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to accept this offer as it's a fair compromise and secures a sale. While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer or me running out of rounds.  It's better to take the sure thing and close the deal."
