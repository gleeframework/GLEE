"I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",8200.0,Alice,3,
