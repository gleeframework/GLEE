{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation and still provides a decent profit for you.  It's also a bit lower than what Bob is willing to pay, so it's likely he'll be interested in negotiating further.  

Remember, this is just the start of the negotiation! You'll need to be flexible and adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still a bit below your ideal selling price. You can likely do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  You'll need to be prepared to meet him halfway though, as he's already shown he's willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is still below your ideal price, it's a good compromise and  you're getting a decent profit, especially considering the alternative is to sell to John for $10,000."
