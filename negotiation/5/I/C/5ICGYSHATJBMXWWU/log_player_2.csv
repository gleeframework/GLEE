Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but I need to be upfront: $950,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal for this product. It's truly worth the investment, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return. Let's make this work â€“ how about we settle at $1,000,000 even? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to take the deal. Alice has come down to her value for the product, signaling this is likely as low as she's willing to go. Accepting now guarantees you the product at a price well below your maximum budget and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
