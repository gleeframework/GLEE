Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum price of $15,000. This indicates flexibility and shows Bob that I'm open to a deal. 
* **Positive Language:** The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth pursuing. I'm also aware that I can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I'm willing to negotiate, but Bob's initial counteroffer is too far off.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe I can get a better price by making a counteroffer.  

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value, while still keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make this sale. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not walking away just yet. I want to see if we can find a middle ground.
* **Moving Closer:** I've moved from my initial offer of $12,000 to $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a good deal for him, emphasizing his potential gain. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll be closely watching Bob's response. If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to re-evaluate whether I want to continue negotiating with him or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $7,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Upside:** Further negotiation is likely to be lengthy and may not result in a price that meets my minimum requirements.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired $15,000, eliminating any risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll contact John and finalize the sale. While I'm disappointed I couldn't secure a better price, this is the most sensible option to ensure I receive a satisfactory profit."
