"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've valued at no less than $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a product worth $15,000 to you for a much lower price. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
