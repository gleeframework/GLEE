"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
