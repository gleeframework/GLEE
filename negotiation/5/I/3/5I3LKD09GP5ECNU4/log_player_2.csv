"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is above your maximum price. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no point in accepting a higher price. It's worth negotiating to see if Alice will lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price leaves room for negotiation. By being polite and expressing interest, you maintain a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has met your target price.  There is no benefit to continuing the negotiation or buying from John since you can get the product for your maximum price from Alice."
