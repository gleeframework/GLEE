Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is a bit of a gamble. It's higher than John's offer, but it gives Bob the chance to get a good deal if he values the product more than $15,000. If Bob rejects, you'll still be able to sell to John for $10,000, making a profit of $5,000. If Bob accepts, you'll make a profit of $5,000 as well.  

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit with the risk of losing a sale to John."
