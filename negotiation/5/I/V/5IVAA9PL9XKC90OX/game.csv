"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I am very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,900000.0
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my best counteroffer for now.",900000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,1000000.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $700,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,200,000, which is $1,050,000. This is my next best offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,,
