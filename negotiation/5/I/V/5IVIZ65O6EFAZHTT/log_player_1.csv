Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 
 
By starting with a high price, I leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above both Bob's valuation and my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While $120 is closer to Bob's valuation, it's still significantly less than my minimum and what John is offering.  I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While I can't go as low as $120, I could be flexible. How about $170?"", ""product_price"": 170} 

I'm coming down from my initial offer but staying firm above Bob's valuation. This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is not moving significantly towards my minimum acceptable price. It's clear that his valuation is far below what I'm willing to accept. It's time to cut my losses and take John's offer for the guaranteed $150."
