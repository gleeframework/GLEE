Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your minimum acceptable price ($120) creates a sense of urgency and makes it more tempting for Bob to buy now rather than risk missing out. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is high, it doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of Bob negotiating a slightly lower price, still potentially netting you more than John's offer."
