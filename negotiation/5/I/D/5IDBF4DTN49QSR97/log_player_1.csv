Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still being a good deal for you."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets a $500 discount from his perceived value, and I earn an extra $1,500 compared to selling to John. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and highlights the value proposition for Bob."
