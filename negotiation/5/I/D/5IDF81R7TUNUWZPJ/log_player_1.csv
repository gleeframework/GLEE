Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $150.  
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have John who will buy the product for $150, guaranteeing your minimum.

**Strategy:**

Offering the product at $145 gives Bob a chance to get it for $25 less than what you value it at. This creates a potential win for Bob while still giving you a profit above your minimum if he accepts. If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything because you can sell to John for your desired price."
