"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $100.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $105. This is a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference again and go with $100.  I'm really hoping we can make this work.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I want to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $102.50. This is a really fair price, and it's the closest I can come without going below my minimum. Let's close this deal!",102.5,Alice,7,
