Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering. $150 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $95 still  doesn't work for me. I could go down to $105, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $105 is her final offer. While this is below her value and your absolute limit, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $100 from John. It makes more sense to take the sure thing and save $5 than to risk Alice not budging."
