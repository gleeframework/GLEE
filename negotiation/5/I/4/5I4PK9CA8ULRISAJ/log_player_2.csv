"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $14,000, especially since you're willing to pay up to $15,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $12,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is a good price for you.  It's worth accepting the offer to avoid further negotiation and the risk of having to buy from John for a higher price."
