Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Reasonable:** $14,000 is less than what Bob values the product at, but still a decent profit for you.
* **Not too low:**  It shows that you're serious about selling to Bob and you're not just trying to squeeze every dollar out of him.

This approach leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers, but still puts you in a good position to secure a sale at a price you're happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is lower than what you'd ideally like, it's still above your minimum threshold of $10,000.  It's worthwhile to try and negotiate further. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap between your desired price and his offer, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $12,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
