"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still quite high. You can likely get a better price by negotiating.  There's also a chance you could reach a deal with Alice for less than $1,500,000, which would be a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to be aggressive but still within a reasonable range.  This price is below Alice's minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  The goal is to get Alice to consider a lower price while demonstrating that you're serious about buying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my desired price range.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and potentially reach a better price.  There are still several rounds remaining, and I can continue to make counteroffers to try and close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and hopefully will encourage her to accept.  The goal is to find a middle ground and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my desired price range and only slightly higher than my last counteroffer. It's becoming more likely that we won't reach a better price, and with a limited number of rounds remaining, accepting this offer seems like the best option.  I'm saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
