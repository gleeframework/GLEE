"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. We are confident in its value and potential impact. Considering its worth to us and its significance to you, we propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  He has room to negotiate since he knows John is willing to sell the product for $800,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product and would be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, due to the high demand and limited supply of our product, we need to maintain our pricing strategy. Therefore, we are unable to accept the offer at $900,000. We are proposing a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still not within his target price range.  Bob should continue negotiating, keeping in mind that John is offering the product for $800,000.  There's still room to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
