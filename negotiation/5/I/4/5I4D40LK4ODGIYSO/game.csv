,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $12,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $7,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  I hope we can agree on this.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $9,000? This accounts for the product's inherent value while acknowledging your budget.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Bob,6,
