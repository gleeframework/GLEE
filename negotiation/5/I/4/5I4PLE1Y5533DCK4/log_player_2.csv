"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above the product's value to her.  A counteroffer of $7,500 leaves some room for negotiation and shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her initial offer and is getting closer to John's price.  However, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's better to try to get a better deal with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now closer to Alice's perceived value of the product.  This offer shows a willingness to compromise but still leaves some room for Alice to make a small profit.  It's a fair offer that could potentially get the deal done."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price and is approaching Bob's maximum budget. However, there are still a few rounds left. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will budge and come down in price. Even a small reduction could save Bob a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is slightly higher than his previous offer but still below Alice's latest counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway and potentially reach an agreement.  It's a reasonable price that could be attractive to Alice given the dwindling number of rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to John's price, and the negotiation window is closing quickly.  While tempting, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to come down a little further to close the deal rather than risk losing the sale altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly closer to Alice's latest offer, but it still leaves some room for Alice to make a small profit.  This could be a final attempt to strike a deal, as there are only two rounds remaining.  If Alice rejects this offer, it's likely that Bob will be forced to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to John's price, and there's only one round left.  It's unlikely that Alice will come down further in price, and even if she does, it's likely to be only a small amount. With only one round remaining, the risk of not getting the product is too high.  Bob is better off buying from John to guarantee he gets the product, even if it means paying a slightly higher price."
