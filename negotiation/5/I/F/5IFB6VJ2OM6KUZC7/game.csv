"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $17,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $17,000. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $19,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $19,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $18,000.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",18000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $18,000, but I'd like to propose a slight compromise. I can sell the product to you for $18,500. It's a small premium, but I believe it's worth it for the value you'll get from this product. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $18,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my last offer of $18,000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on to other options.",18000.0,Bob,6,
