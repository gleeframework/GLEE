"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,700,000 is too high.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,700,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,600,000?  This gives us both room to negotiate and still allows me to get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $1,600,000 is still above his target price of $1,500,000. 
* **There's still room to negotiate.**  Bob has 7 rounds left, and he can likely get Alice to come down further.
* **Buying from John is an option.** However, since Bob hasn't exhausted the negotiation process, it's best to keep trying to get a better price from Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,600,000. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to go to $1,550,000. This is a fair price that lets us both benefit from the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
