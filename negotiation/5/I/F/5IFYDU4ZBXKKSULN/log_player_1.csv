Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob immediately, even at a slight discount, avoids the potential delay of waiting for John to complete the purchase.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob."
