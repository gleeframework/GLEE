"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure $12000 is within my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to counter with $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $10800. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
