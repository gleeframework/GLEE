Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price and a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but I also want to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $9,500 is a strong starting point, offering slightly below my minimum allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate upwards or for me to accept a slightly lower price if needed.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, hoping to persuade him that the price is justified."
