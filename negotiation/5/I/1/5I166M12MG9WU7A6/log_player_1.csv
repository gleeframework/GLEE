"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think it would be perfect for you!  I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob is offering exactly my lowest acceptable price. There's no room for negotiation upwards, and holding out hope for more is risky.
