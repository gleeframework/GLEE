"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm currently working with a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This would still give you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the flexibility shown. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly settle on $9,000 for the product? This would still allow me to acquire a valuable item while staying within my financial limits.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000. That's a good step in the right direction. However, I'm still a bit too far apart from where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This would still be a very good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I've been thinking about it, and I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Could we meet at $10,500 for the product? This would be a fair compromise that respects my budget while allowing you to make a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Bob,6,
