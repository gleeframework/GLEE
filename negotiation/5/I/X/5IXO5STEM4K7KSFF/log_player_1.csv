Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 gives me leverage. Bob doesn't need to know about John specifically, but my confidence in the price reflects this.
* **Justification:**  By saying ""I believe it's worth a significant amount,"" I'm subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind without directly revealing my bottom line.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Excellent! I get more than my minimum and even more than Bob initially perceived the product's worth.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  This opens the door for a back-and-forth. I can gauge his interest and potentially still settle above my $10,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:**  No problem. I move on to John and secure my $10,000."
