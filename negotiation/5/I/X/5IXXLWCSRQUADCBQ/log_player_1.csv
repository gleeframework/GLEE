Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **The Goal:** Maximize your profit, ideally selling above John's offer.

**Offer Strategy**

You need to make an offer enticing enough for Bob to accept, but leaving room for your own profit. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth and the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:**  The offer is significantly below Bob's $1,200,000 valuation, making it attractive.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is tempting, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to $1,400,000.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" adds perceived value, making the price seem more reasonable.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** How you proceed depends on Bob's reaction. If he rejects the offer outright or counters with a significantly lower amount (e.g., close to $1,200,000), you're better off going with John.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Successful negotiation involves reading the other party, understanding their motivations, and adjusting your approach accordingly. 

This scenario highlights the importance of having a backup plan (John) and leveraging information about your buyer to maximize your potential gain."
