Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,600,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating, but $1,350,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth.

# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. $1,450,000 is a good offer, but I need to see just a bit more to make this deal work. How about $1,475,000? It's a small compromise on my end, and it puts us both closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to make this happen.
