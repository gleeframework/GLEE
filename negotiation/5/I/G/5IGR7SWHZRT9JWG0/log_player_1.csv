Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can do better.  I'm not ready to settle for that price just yet.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,600,000?

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, $1,350,000 is still too low. I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm going to keep trying."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating, but $1,350,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. I'm prepared to come down a bit further, but I need to see a more substantial increase from your side. I'm offering $1,550,000. It's a fair price, and it leaves room for both of us to profit from this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not ready to settle for $1,450,000. I want to see if I can get a little closer to my goal of $1,500,000.  I'm going to see if I can get him to budge just a bit more."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. $1,450,000 is a good offer, but I need to see just a bit more to make this deal work. How about $1,475,000?

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and I'm still not satisfied with Bob's latest offer. It's getting too risky to keep going back and forth.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  To ensure I get at least my minimum asking price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
