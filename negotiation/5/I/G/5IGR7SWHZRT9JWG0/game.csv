"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment. I'm offering it to you for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's discuss this further.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it allows me to get closer to the value I know this product holds. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating, but $1,350,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. I'm prepared to come down a bit further, but I need to see a more substantial increase from your side. I'm offering $1,550,000. It's a fair price, and it leaves room for both of us to profit from this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer. $1,450,000 is a good offer, but I need to see just a bit more to make this deal work. How about $1,475,000? It's a small compromise on my end, and it puts us both closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to make this happen.",1475000.0,Alice,7,
