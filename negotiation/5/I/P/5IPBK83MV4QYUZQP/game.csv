"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial proposal. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $10,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $10,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $11,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to accept $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
