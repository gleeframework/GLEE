"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above what the product is worth to you. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if Alice will come down in price.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting the offer, you can start a negotiation process that could lead to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial proposal. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $10,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $10,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $11,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she's moved closer to your initial counteroffer, $11,500 is still more than the product is worth to you.
* **Further negotiation is likely:** You've already made some progress, and Alice seems willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There are still 7 rounds left, which gives you time to see if you can get Alice to drop her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to accept $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $11,000 is getting closer to your desired price point. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer again. 
* **Time is a factor:** You only have 5 rounds left, and you don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Better than John's offer:**  Accepting this offer is still significantly better than buying from John.

**Strategy:** 
It's a calculated risk, but accepting the offer now secures a good price and avoids further negotiation that could lead to a stalemate or a worse outcome."
