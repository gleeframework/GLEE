"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $22,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product represents significant value and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet halfway at $15,000? This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $15,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  It's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $10,000.  How about we settle on $13,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product while hopefully still working for you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still too high for me. My absolute maximum is $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,6,
