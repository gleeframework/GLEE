"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While it looks like a great product, $110 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $90. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $90 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to go down to $80? That's the most I can offer at the moment.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already gone down to $90 from my initial offer of $110, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think $85 is a fair compromise. It's still a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it.",85.0,Alice,5,
