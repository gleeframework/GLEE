"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm happy to meet you at $1,100,000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going all the way down to $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
