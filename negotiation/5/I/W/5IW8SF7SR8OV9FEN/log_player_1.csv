Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I believe the product is worth more than $8,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,500. Does that sound more reasonable?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we try $9,500? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,500 is a fair compromise. It's more than what John is offering, and I'm confident I can make a good profit."
