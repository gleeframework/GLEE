{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $9,500, which is less than your maximum budget of $10,000. This means you can save $500 by accepting her offer.  While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee you'd get a better deal, and buying from John would cost you more."
