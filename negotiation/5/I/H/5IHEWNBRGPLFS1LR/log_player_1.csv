Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  I believe $1,200,000 is a fair starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves space for Bob to negotiate. This should encourage him to make a counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a decent profit, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $1,100,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while remaining within my target price range. By offering $1,100,000, I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to drop too low. This encourages Bob to consider my offer and potentially come closer to my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to be as frugal as possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is still a decent profit, it's not quite where I want to be. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price, but also be prepared to make a final concession if necessary to close this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This price is still very attractive to you, and it allows me to achieve a fair profit. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating that I'm flexible but not willing to significantly lower my price. Offering $1,025,000 is a middle ground, suggesting a willingness to meet Bob halfway. This strategy encourages him to consider accepting the offer or potentially making a final counteroffer closer to my price,  bringing us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still trying to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to accept it. I believe I can still get a little closer to my target price. I'll make one last counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and your interest in my product.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle on $1,000,000?  This is the absolute lowest I can go.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This final counteroffer shows that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000. This strategy is designed to put the pressure on Bob to either accept the offer or risk losing the opportunity to buy the product. I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't accept this final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but I'm still trying to save some money. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It seems like we've reached an impasse with Bob.  While $975,000 is still a good profit, it's not quite where I want to be, and I don't think Bob is going to budge much further.  To avoid further negotiations and secure a decent profit, I'll sell the product to John for $800,000."
