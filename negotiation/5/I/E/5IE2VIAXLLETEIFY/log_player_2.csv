"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. We have no information about the product's value to Alice, so we can't be sure if this is a fair price.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows us to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $10,000 gives us a strong starting point for negotiation.  This shows Alice that we're serious about getting a good deal, and it gives us room to negotiate upward if needed.  We'll adjust our strategy based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, which is encouraging. However, we're still aiming to get a better deal.  Rejecting and counteroffering again allows us to potentially get closer to our desired price without committing to $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've seen Alice is willing to negotiate, and her offer of $14,000 suggests she's willing to go lower than her initial $15,000.  Increasing our counteroffer to $12,000 shows we're serious about getting a good deal but also willing to compromise.  This gives us a good chance of reaching a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now lowered her price to $13,000. This is within our acceptable range and getting closer to our target price.  While we could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away increases with each round. Accepting this offer secures the product for us at a good price,  saving us $2,000 compared to buying from John."
