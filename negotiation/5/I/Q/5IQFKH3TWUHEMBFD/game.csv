"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,500,000 is a strong offer, I believe the product's unique value justifies a higher price point. Would you consider $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,550,000. Can you consider this offer?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
