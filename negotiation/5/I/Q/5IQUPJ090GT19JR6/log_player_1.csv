Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $140, which is still lower than the product's value to Bob ($150) but allows for potential negotiation. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and highlighting the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing us to potentially reach a price that benefits both of us.
* **Backup Plan:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose out on the product's minimum value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I think $125 would be a fair price for the product. Let me know if we can agree on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value for Me:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price ($120), I can potentially get a slightly higher price.  
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counter-offer and try to inch closer to my desired price of $140.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** I'm willing to risk losing Bob as a buyer for a potential gain of $5, knowing I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested in the product. I can do $135. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($125). It shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Message:**  The message remains positive and highlights the value proposition for Bob, even as it firmifies my position.
* **Leaving Room for Agreement:**  This offer still gives Bob some room to counter if he wants, but it's closer to my target price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By holding firm at $135, I am taking a calculated risk but also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. I'd like to counter with $130 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $130 is just $5 below my initial target of $135. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could potentially get a little more by continuing to negotiate, there's a chance Bob could walk away completely. 
* **Securing Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit of $10, which is a good outcome considering the potential for a lower price if I keep negotiating. 
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting now saves time and effort compared to continuing negotiations."
