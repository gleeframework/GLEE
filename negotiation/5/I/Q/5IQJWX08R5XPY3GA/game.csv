"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium.

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle again at $760,000? I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to make sure it works for me financially.",760000.0,Bob,4,
