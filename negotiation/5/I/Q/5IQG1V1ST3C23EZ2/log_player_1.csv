"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is much higher. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still lower than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing my potential profit.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob will receive, hoping to incentivize him to accept the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message conveys that I'm willing to negotiate, making it less likely Bob will immediately reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't commit to $12000. How about we try something closer to $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:** While it's closer to my minimum, $9,000 is still below what I'm hoping to achieve. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still potential to get a better price, especially since I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob.
* **No need to settle:**  With 8 rounds remaining, I'm not desperate enough to accept his offer. I'll counter and see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair given the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value Bob will receive, hoping to motivate him to compromise.
* **Setting a Deadline:** By suggesting finding ""common ground,"" I subtly imply that I'm ready to negotiate, but not endlessly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. Would $10000 be within your range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $10,000 is still below my target.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I have 6 rounds left, and Bob is clearly willing to negotiate. I'm confident I can push for a better price.
* **Jhon's offer is a safety net:** While $8,000 is my minimum, selling to Jhon is a last resort. I'm not ready to give up on a better deal with Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  This feels like a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering to meet halfway again, demonstrating my willingness to find common ground.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, subtly suggesting he's getting a good deal.
* **Finality implied:** By using ""settle,"" I'm subtly indicating that I'm ready to close the deal at this price, but may not budge further."
