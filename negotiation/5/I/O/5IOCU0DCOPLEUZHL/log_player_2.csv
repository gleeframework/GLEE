# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premier product, which I believe aligns perfectly with your needs and expectations. This exceptional item holds significant value for us, but considering its importance to you, we aim to make it accessible while ensuring fair compensation for us. We kindly propose a purchase price of $950,000. This figure reflects the product's true worth while leaving room for negotiation if necessary. We look forward to discussing this opportunity further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is only slightly below your maximum budget and significantly higher than her own valuation. 
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. 
* While you could buy from John for $1,000,000, there's a chance Alice might come back with a lower offer to avoid losing the sale."
