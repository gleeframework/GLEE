"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $950,000 is significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $800,000.  
* **Potential for negotiation:** There's room for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Having the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 provides a fallback if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident that this product will bring you significant value exceeding that amount. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's closer to my desired price, $900,000 is still above her own valuation.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** I can likely get the price lower by counteroffering again.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:** If negotiations fail, I can still buy from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise again. I'm willing to offer $875,000, which is closer to my initial offer and still leaves you with a substantial profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's wrap this up. How about $885,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my desired price:** $885,000 is a good compromise, considering my original counteroffer of $850,000 and Alice's previous offer of $900,000.
* **Value proposition:**  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential savings. 
* **Limited rounds:** With only five rounds left, continuing to negotiate might result in a stalemate or a higher price from John. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price within my budget and leaves room for profit, making it a smart decision."
