"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,800,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to go up to $1,600,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
