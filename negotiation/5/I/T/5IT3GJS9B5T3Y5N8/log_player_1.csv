I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this will give Bob a sense of value while leaving me with a comfortable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, demonstrating flexibility but still leaving room for a profit. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that might convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my desired price and significantly better than selling to John.  I'll accept this offer to secure the sale."
