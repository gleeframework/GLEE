"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you highlighting the potential of this product. However, $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it.  I believe this price reflects the value we've discussed and still allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your interest. While $1100000 is a bit lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1250000 for the product. This price still reflects its significant value and the potential benefits it can offer. Let's find a way to make this deal work for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
