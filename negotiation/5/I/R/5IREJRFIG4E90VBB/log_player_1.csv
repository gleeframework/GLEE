Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you highlighting the potential of this product. However, $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it.  I believe this price reflects the value we've discussed and still allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
