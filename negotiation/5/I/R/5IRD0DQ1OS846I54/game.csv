,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 at this time. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $175?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $150.  This is my final offer.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you at $180, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product!",180.0,Alice,5,
