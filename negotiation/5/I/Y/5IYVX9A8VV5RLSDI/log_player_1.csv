Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While Bob values the product at $80, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more depending on its perceived value or need.  
* **Below John's Offer:** This offer ensures that if Bob rejects, you're still getting your minimum acceptable price from John. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial price."
