{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit higher than my minimum value of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to build rapport with Bob.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle at $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still willing to negotiate.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $13,500 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still above my minimum of $10,000 and represents a good deal.  It's time to accept his offer and move on."
