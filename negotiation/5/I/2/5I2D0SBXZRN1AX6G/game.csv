"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,350,000? It's a fair price that still allows me to recover a good portion of my investment.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
