"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. Is this a more comfortable price for you?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1000000. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking that $1050000 is a bit too low, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm willing to make a last offer.
