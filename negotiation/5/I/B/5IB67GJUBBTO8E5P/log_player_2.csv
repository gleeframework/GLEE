**Reasoning:** 

Alice is playing hardball and has given a ""take it or leave it"" offer.  While the price is getting closer to palatable, it's still significantly higher than John's $8,000 offer. Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her not budging further and Bob missing out on a better deal.  It's time to cut losses and go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
