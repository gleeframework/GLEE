"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering. $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be open to $12,000?  I feel that's a reasonable compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $14,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $13,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making this work.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting close. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,000 is really pushing my limit.  My final offer is $13,750.  Take it or leave it.",13750.0,Alice,7,
