"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is still too high for his budget. He can get a better deal by either negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This offer is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still not quite where I need to be. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000. This is a substantial compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.
