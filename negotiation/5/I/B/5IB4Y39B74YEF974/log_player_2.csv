"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still above your maximum budget.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $1,050,000?  I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still within your budget, and it's a significant improvement from her initial offer. While you could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer again, and you might end up paying more or having to buy from John.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product within your budget."
