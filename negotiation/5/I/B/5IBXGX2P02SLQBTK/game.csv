"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, but I need to make a profit. Can we discuss this further?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about making a profit, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'll counter with $13000. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to cover my costs.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13000? This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your initial offer, so I'll counter with $11500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",11500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate at this point. I appreciate your persistence, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,9,
