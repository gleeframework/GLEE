"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $10,000 and Alice has offered the product at $10,000, there's no incentive to negotiate.  Buying from John immediately guarantees you the product at your maximum price point."
