"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it's the highest I can go. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $950,000 to make this work.  This is still a significant discount from my original asking price, and a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a certain amount to make this work, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,
