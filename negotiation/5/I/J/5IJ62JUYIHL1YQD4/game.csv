"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $155. Let me know if that works for you.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $140, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $150, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If that's still not good enough, I'll have to consider other options.",150.0,Alice,5,
