Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me, given my minimum of $8,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the true value of this product.  How about $9,750?  It's a fair compromise and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $9600. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to $9,750, Bob's counteroffer of $9,600 is getting closer to my desired price. With only 6 rounds left, I think it's reasonable to accept and secure the deal."
