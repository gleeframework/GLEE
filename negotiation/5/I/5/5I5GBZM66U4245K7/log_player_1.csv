Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than my minimum asking price, and still gives you a good margin for profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's below your minimum:**  $900,000 is still a profitable sale for you.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob might counteroffer, but you have room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **It demonstrates flexibility:** You're not starting at a high price and being unreasonable. 

Keep in mind, this is just the beginning of the negotiation! You'll need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's response and John's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  $850,000 is still less than your minimum asking price of $1,000,000. 
* **You have a better alternative:** John is willing to pay $1,000,000, which is much closer to your desired price.
* **You have leverage:** Bob has already rejected your offer, showing his willingness to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

Since you're rejecting Bob's offer, you will need to send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. Here's a suggested counteroffer: 

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is above Bob's offer:** Shows you're not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Is closer to your minimum:**  Allows for a potential deal that's closer to your desired outcome.
* **Shows a willingness to negotiate:** Signals that you're open to reaching an agreement."
