Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I've already made several concessions, and I need to get closer to my minimum. I'll make one last offer: $110. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge below $100.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $80, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the extra money."
