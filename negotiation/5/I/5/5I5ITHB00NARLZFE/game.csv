"I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider it?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $125 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $130. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider it?",125.0,Bob,6,
