"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not comfortable with the price you've proposed. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer the product to you at $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're still a bit off on the price, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to be careful not to give it away. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
