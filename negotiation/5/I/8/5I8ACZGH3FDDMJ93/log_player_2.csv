# Alice's message: I can see you're still a bit off on the price, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to be careful not to give it away. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice has reached her minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting at $800,000 ensures you get the product at a price well below your maximum."
