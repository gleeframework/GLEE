{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I know it's worth $8,000 to you, but I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob a reason to consider the offer, as he's getting it for less than what he'd be willing to pay elsewhere.
* **It's below my minimum:** This allows for potential negotiation and doesn't lock me into my absolute minimum.  
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters with a lower price, I can still potentially come to a deal that benefits both of us.

I'm willing to take a slightly lower price than my minimum if it means I can sell to Bob and avoid dealing with John. However, I'm confident that $10,000 is a fair price that both of us can agree on."
