"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you see the value in, for $13,000.  I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is still considerably higher than John's backup offer. There's room to negotiate or see if Alice will lower her price."
