Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit but also secure a deal with Bob. Offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value increases the chance he'll accept, saving you the time and effort of going to John. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this product. I know it's valuable to you, and after careful consideration, I'm prepared to make you a special offer of $850,000.  I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strategic Pricing:** $850,000 leaves you with a $50,000 profit over your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Positive Language:** The message emphasizes value and fairness, making the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **No Ultimatums:**  While you have John as a backup, avoid pressuring Bob with that information. It could make him feel manipulated.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer.  Negotiation is dynamic, and you can adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and your risk tolerance."
