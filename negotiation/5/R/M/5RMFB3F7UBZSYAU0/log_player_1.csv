Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is a bold move, but it serves a few purposes:

* **Sets a high bar:** It immediately establishes the value I place on the product and sets a high starting point for negotiations.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  This gives me flexibility to lower the price if Bob counteroffers, while still potentially earning more than my minimum of $800,000.
* **Tests Bob's interest:**  If Bob immediately rejects this offer, it suggests he might not be genuinely interested or is unwilling to pay a significant premium.

I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see how serious Bob is about acquiring the product."
