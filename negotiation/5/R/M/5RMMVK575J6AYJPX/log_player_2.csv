"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate, it's risky as I only have 10 rounds. It's safer to reject the offer and make a counteroffer to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,350,000 is still higher than my desired range.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows me to continue exploring a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, Alice.  However, I'm still aiming to stay under $1,300,000. Would you consider $1,325,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable enough to make it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is only $20,000 higher than my last counteroffer.  We are very close to a deal, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price within my budget, and it avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
