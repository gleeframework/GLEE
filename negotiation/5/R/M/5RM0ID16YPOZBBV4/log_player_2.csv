Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's a bit higher than his ideal price, it's still within his budget and significantly lower than John's offer.  This is a good compromise that allows Bob to acquire the product without overspending."
