"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,700,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
