"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know you'd find it equally valuable. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its worth, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You know John will sell you the product for $1,200,000. Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John."
