"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This would still leave you with a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet at $1000000 due to my budget constraints. I would like to propose $900000 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,4,
