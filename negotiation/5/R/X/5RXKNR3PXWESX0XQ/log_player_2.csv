"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it could really benefit you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's seriousness in getting a lower price. It's also a considerable amount lower than his alternative option with John, giving Alice some room to negotiate."
