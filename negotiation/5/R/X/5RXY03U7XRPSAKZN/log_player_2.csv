"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and also less than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you money."
