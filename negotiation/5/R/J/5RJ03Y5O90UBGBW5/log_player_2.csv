Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is my best and final offer for now. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm open to hearing your next move. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is signaling this is her best offer for now, and the price of $850,000 is within your budget. While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice might retract this offer, and you might end up paying a higher price later in the negotiation or having to buy from John at your maximum budget."
