Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind crafting an offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **The Goal:** Maximize your profit by seeing how much above $800,000 Bob is willing to pay.

**The Offer**

We need to balance ambition with realism.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Strong Opening:** Acknowledging the ""unique value"" sets a positive tone and implies it's worth a premium.
* **Ambitious but Justified Price:** The $150,000 markup aims for significant profit. We're betting Bob sees the product's value and might be willing to pay a premium to secure it.
* **Confident Tone:** The language is firm but not aggressive, suggesting this is a carefully considered offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start lower (e.g., $900,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Market Context:** If similar products have recently sold for higher prices, you might justify an even higher initial offer.

**Remember:** This is just the first move. Bob can counter-offer, leading to further negotiation."
