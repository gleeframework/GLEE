"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to pay $12,000 for the product, as it's the maximum value I see in it.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $14,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the maximum I'm willing to pay.  Let me know if you're open to that.",12000.0,Bob,4,
