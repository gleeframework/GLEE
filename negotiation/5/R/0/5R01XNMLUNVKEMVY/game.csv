"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a special price of $12,000. I think you'll find it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about we try $11,200? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering.",11200.0,Alice,5,
