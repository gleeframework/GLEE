# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1250000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I believe the product holds. What do you think, Bob? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is slightly higher than John's price of $1,200,000. However, it's still within your budget and a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer might be beneficial, as there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and you risk spending more time negotiating."
