I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's less than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm also confident that I can get at least $12,000 from John if things don't work out with Bob."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm happy to get $12,000, I believe I can do better. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's offer while still leaving some room for profit. I believe this price is fair, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
