"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? I believe this price still offers great value for you while allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
