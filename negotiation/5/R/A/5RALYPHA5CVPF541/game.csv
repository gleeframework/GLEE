"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value you'll get from this product.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product, and it's still a good deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $13,500 is closer, but it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate that. $13,000 is tempting, but I'm working with a tight budget. How about we settle on $12,250? That's my final offer.",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,250 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept a price that's below my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $12,800. This is my final counteroffer.",12800.0,Alice,7,
