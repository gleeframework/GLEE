Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is still above my maximum value of $1,000,000, but it's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but also willing to negotiate. I've left some room for further negotiation, as there are still several rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for future gains. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm still staying within my budget. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum value.  I'm also emphasizing the idea of a compromise and finalizing the deal. This can help encourage Alice to accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still too far off from where we need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This is a substantial discount from my original asking price and a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's finalize this deal and make it happen.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's finalize this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a slight increase to my offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.  However, it's still below my maximum value, leaving some room for future rounds. I'm emphasizing the importance of reaching a final agreement to pressure Alice into accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your limitations, but $1,300,000 is still not quite there. Let's aim for a final compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This shows my commitment to finding a solution and secures a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum value of $1,000,000.  While I'm close to reaching a deal, the remaining rounds may not be enough to push her lower.  I've already invested significant time in negotiation.  To ensure I secure the product within my budget and avoid further negotiation, it's more efficient to buy from John at $1,000,000."
