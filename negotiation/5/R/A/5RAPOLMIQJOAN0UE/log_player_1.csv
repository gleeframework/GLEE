"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired value.  I believe I can get closer to my target price with more negotiation.  Selling to John right now would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for future gains. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I have several rounds left and can continue to push for a higher price.  Selling to John now would be a loss compared to what I could potentially get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still too far off from where we need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This is a substantial discount from my original asking price and a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's finalize this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's finalize this deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is steadily increasing his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. We're approaching the middle ground, but I believe with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can secure a deal closer to my target price. Selling to John now would be a missed opportunity to maximize my profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your limitations, but $1,300,000 is still not quite there. Let's aim for a final compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This shows my commitment to finding a solution and secures a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
