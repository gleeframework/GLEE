"Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's work together to find a solution.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for future gains. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still too far off from where we need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This is a substantial discount from my original asking price and a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's finalize this deal and make it happen.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's finalize this deal now.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your limitations, but $1,300,000 is still not quite there. Let's aim for a final compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This shows my commitment to finding a solution and secures a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
