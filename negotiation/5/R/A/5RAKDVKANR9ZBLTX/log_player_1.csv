I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's below Bob's estimated value of $15,000 but still well above my minimum of $10,000.  I'm hoping to negotiate a higher price, but I'm also willing to walk away if necessary and sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's still better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $13,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable middle ground."
