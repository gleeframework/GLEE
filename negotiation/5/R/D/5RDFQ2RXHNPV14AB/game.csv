"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,112,500? I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds for your business.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1112500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm getting closer, but $1,112,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $1,090,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1090000.0,Bob,4,
