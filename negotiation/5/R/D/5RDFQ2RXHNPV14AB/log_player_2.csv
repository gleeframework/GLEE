"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still significantly above her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1075000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** By suggesting a middle ground, I demonstrate that I'm serious about buying but want a fair deal.
* **Starts below my maximum:**  This leaves me room to negotiate upward if needed while still staying below my $1,200,000 limit. 
* **Aims for a significant saving:**  $1,075,000 is a $75,000 saving compared to Alice's initial offer and $125,000 less than John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,112,500? I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds for your business.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,112,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, she's still heavily weighting the perceived value to me rather than her own valuation. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to $1,100,000 or lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm getting closer, but $1,112,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $1,090,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continued Negotiation:**  I'm still aiming for a lower price, showing Alice I'm serious about the purchase but not willing to overpay.
* **Small Concession:** By increasing my offer slightly, I'm demonstrating movement and a willingness to meet in the middle. 
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:**  This counteroffer is a strategic move to try and secure a price closer to my ideal outcome.  It keeps the pressure on Alice to either accept a lower price than she initially wanted or potentially lose the sale."
