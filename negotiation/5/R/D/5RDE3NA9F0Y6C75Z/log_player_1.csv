{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,080,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Exceeds my minimum:** It's $80,000 more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation progress:** Bob is clearly interested and incrementally increasing his offer.  
* **Time value:**  Dragging out the negotiation has risks (Bob could walk away) and ties up the product I could sell to John immediately. 

Accepting a strong offer now outweighs the potential for a marginally better deal later."
