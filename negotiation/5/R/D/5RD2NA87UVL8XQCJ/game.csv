"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for it.",1125000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective on the price,  $1,125,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. To move this forward, I could consider $1,875,000. This still offers you significant value for the benefits you'll receive.",1875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I'm getting closer on price, but $1,875,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $1,500,000? That feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
