Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's worth it to see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my investment in it. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,850,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,850,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we split the difference from our last offers, say $1,425,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

While closer, Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate one more time before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer!  I want to find a way for us to make this work.  How about we settle at $1,625,000?  That's a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to come up a little bit.  How about $1,500,000, and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

``` 

Bob's offer now matches John's. It's better to close the deal now for $1,500,000 rather than risk Bob lowering his offer in future rounds."
