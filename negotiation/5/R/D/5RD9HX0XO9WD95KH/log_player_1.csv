Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice knows she has a safety net with John ($1,500,000). This is her minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  Alice needs to find a price that's higher than her bottom line but also enticing enough for Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe holds significant value for your business. I'm offering it at a competitive price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I've had substantial interest from other parties."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant profit above Alice's minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" introduces a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob's business rather than solely on the price.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Key:**  This offer is just the opening move. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.
* **Walk-Away Point:**  Alice should be willing to walk away from the deal if Bob doesn't offer a price reasonably above her minimum of $1,500,000. John provides that safety net."
