Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can afford to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Offering it at $135 gives Bob a chance to accept and you make a $15 profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, the message leaves room for negotiation. You can then potentially lower the price, aiming for a price between $120 and $135.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important:** It's crucial to strike a balance. While you want to maximize profit, setting the price too high might make Bob immediately lose interest and refuse to negotiate."
