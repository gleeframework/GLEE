{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate, but it's also significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and optimistic, emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product. This helps create a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a win-win situation. A price of $12,000 would give Bob a good deal, while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price.
* This offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate while also setting a clear expectation that I'm not willing to sell for a significantly lower price.
* I have the option to walk away and sell to John at any time, which gives me leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $10000. Would you be able to consider a counteroffer of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price.

**Strategy:**

* **Reject and Counteroffer:**  I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer closer to my minimum price. This demonstrates my commitment to a fair deal while still allowing room for compromise.
* **Leverage John:** The possibility of selling to John for $15,000 gives me strong leverage in the negotiation. 

My counteroffer will aim to reach a compromise closer to my desired price, but I will be prepared to walk away if Bob is unwilling to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget, $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $11,500:** This offer is a compromise. It's halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.  
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.  It acknowledges his budget concerns while also highlighting the deal's potential.

**Strategy:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob's Offer:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise, signaling that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum price, and I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to budge.
* **Setting a Deadline:** I might also consider setting a deadline for Bob's decision to create a sense of urgency.  

My goal is to get as close to my minimum price as possible while still finding a solution that works for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I really value your product, but I'm still working within a tight budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's still a bit lower than I would ideally like, accepting his offer would be a good outcome. It allows me to secure a sale while still getting a decent price.

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing Factors:**  I need to weigh the potential of getting a slightly higher price through further negotiation against the risk of losing the sale entirely.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Bob's offer is close enough that the risk of rejection outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer.
* **Time Value of Money:**  It's also important to consider the time value of money.  Accepting the offer now allows me to secure the sale and move on.

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a deal that's close to my minimum price, minimize the risk of losing the sale, and avoid further delays in the negotiation process."
