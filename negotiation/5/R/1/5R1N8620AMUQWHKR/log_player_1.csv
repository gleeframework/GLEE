Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this moment. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
