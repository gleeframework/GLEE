"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been carefully developing and I think it aligns perfectly with your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit as well. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $13,000 is less than $15,000, so it's a better deal for Bob.
* **Bob can still make a profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000 and is buying it for $13,000, meaning he's saving $2,000."
