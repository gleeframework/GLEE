"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $15,500? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's try to work something out.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off from that number. I could potentially stretch to $13,500, but that's really the most I can do.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $14,250. This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.  What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. How about we settle at $14,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",14000.0,Bob,6,
