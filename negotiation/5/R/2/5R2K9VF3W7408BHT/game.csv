,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
