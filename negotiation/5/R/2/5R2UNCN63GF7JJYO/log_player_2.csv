"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to Bob, it's still above his maximum budget. He can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal."
