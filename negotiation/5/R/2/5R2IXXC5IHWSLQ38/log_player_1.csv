"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $140, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize my potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to Bob to reinforce why it's worth the price. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation, allowing me to see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His willingness to negotiate suggests he values the product and is open to a deal.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me, potentially closer to my desired price of $140.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Accepting his offer would limit my earning potential.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows me to maintain control and potentially secure a better price. 

**Next Steps:** 

I'll counter-offer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above his current offer, and emphasize the value proposition of the product."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $135 is closer to where I need to be. This product is truly unique and offers a significant value to you, as you've already acknowledged. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him of its worth and reinforcing the benefits he'll receive.
* **Creating Urgency (Slightly):** The phrase ""find common ground"" subtly suggests that I'm not willing to negotiate much further, subtly increasing the pressure on Bob. 

This counteroffer is strategic: it keeps the negotiation moving forward while still giving me a chance to secure a price closer to my desired $140."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $132.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum of $120, it's still not where I want to be. I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Negotiation is Progressing:** Bob is actively participating in the negotiation and showing a willingness to compromise, indicating a potential for a good deal. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and make a counter-offer that pushes us closer to a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter-offer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still higher than his current offer, aiming to close the gap and find a price we both can agree on."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. How about we split the difference and go with $133.75?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product incredibly valuable."", ""product_price"": 133.75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price exactly halfway between my last offer ($135) and Bob's offer ($132.50). This shows I'm serious about finding a compromise.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll gain.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:** I'm using positive language like ""fair deal"" and ""confident"" to maintain a friendly and collaborative atmosphere.

This counteroffer is designed to bring us closer to a deal without jeopardizing my potential earnings.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not ready to commit to $133.75. I'm willing to go up to $132, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Accepting would still provide me with a decent profit.
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, indicating that further negotiation might be futile.  There's a risk that rejecting his offer could lead to a stalemate or him backing out entirely.
* **Time Pressure:**  We are now in round 6, and with only 4 rounds remaining, it's important to reach an agreement before I have to consider selling to John.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision at this point. It secures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
