"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. Considering its value to you is $12,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
