"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $135, which is a compromise between our previous offers.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $135 is still a bit too high for me. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit, so I can do $130, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",130.0,Alice,5,
