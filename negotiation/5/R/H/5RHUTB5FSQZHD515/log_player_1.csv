Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I really like the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below my minimum of $120."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 130}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you almost halfway.  How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
