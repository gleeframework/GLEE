"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I really like the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you almost halfway.  How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let's close this deal.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
