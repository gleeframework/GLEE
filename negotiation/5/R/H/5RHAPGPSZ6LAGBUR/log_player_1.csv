Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming for a price that leaves room for negotiation but still gives me a good profit. I'll be ready to adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I won't go below my minimum of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get a higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my ideal price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm still aiming for a profit, but I'm willing to compromise a bit.  This price is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $12,000.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price. While it's not my top goal, it's better than selling to John for the minimum price.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
