"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $200, as I want to maximize my potential profit.  It's important to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate from this starting point.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower my offer slightly, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $200."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to $150 with a counteroffer. I still have time to negotiate, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is a slight compromise from my last offer, but I'm still confident it's a fair price. I'm hoping Bob is starting to see the value of the product and will be willing to meet me closer to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I have a few more rounds left, and I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150} 
```

I'm going to counter with $150, my minimum acceptable price. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I need to secure a deal that meets my needs. I'm hoping that Bob is willing to accept this final offer, as it's a fair compromise."
