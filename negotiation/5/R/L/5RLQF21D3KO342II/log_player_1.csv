Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both parties, starting with a higher price ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for Alice.
* **Confident but open to discussion:** The message aims to convey the product's value and Alice's belief in a higher price. However, it also invites Bob to engage in a conversation, suggesting flexibility.
* **Backup plan:** Alice is secure knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 if Bob declines the offer.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential earnings while acknowledging Bob's perspective and potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
