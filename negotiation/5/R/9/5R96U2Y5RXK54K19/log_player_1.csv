Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting price, reflecting the value I place on the product. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate. However, it establishes a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I believe I can still get a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now within a reasonable range, exceeding my minimum acceptable value.  While I might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars by continuing to negotiate, the risk of him walking away entirely is too high.  It's time to close the deal."
