"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. While $13,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product will bring to your business. I think this is a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Explanation:  Alice is very slowly lowering her price.  At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly lower than John's offer within the remaining rounds. It's better to secure the product at a known price than risk a stalemate with Alice."
