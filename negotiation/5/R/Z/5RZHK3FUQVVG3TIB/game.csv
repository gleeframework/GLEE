"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in this product and would be willing to pay $14000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $14000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $16000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $15000 for the product.  What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $16500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. I'm confident that this price will meet your needs and allow us to come to an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,5,
