{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer allows for potential negotiation while still securing a decent profit for myself.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving him room to counter without me losing out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is the maximum I can afford. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'd like to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to compromise that much. I'm confident that John will pay the full asking price."
