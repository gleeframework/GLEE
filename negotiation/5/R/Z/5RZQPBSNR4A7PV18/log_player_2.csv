"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $82.50 is still too high, but $80 is my minimum, and I can meet you right at that point. Would you be willing to take it?

You have three options:

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reached her minimum price of $80.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower. While you could try to haggle further, you risk her withdrawing the offer altogether. Accepting at $80 secures you a good deal and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at $100."
