"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $12,000 represents the true value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a higher price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm still a little ways off though - how about $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting $7,500 would be a substantial loss compared to John's offer. It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
