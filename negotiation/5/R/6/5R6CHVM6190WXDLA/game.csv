"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I do think this product would be valuable to me, but $9,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $8,200. This is still a great deal considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",8200.0,Alice,3,
