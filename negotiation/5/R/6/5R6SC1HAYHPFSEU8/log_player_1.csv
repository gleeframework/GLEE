Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This keeps the negotiation dynamic and allows you to potentially reach a higher price.

Remember, if Bob rejects your offer, you can adjust your strategy based on his counteroffer.  You can also use John as leverage, hinting that you have other buyers if Bob isn't willing to meet your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still far below the potential value of the product to Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows us to continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to our desired $13,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,500?  This still gives you a significant discount compared to the product's real value, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11,750.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $11,750 is pretty close to our desired price of $12,500. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000, making it the most profitable option.  While we could continue negotiating, the risk of Bob walking away entirely or our time being wasted on further negotiations outweighs the potential gain from a few hundred dollars more. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit and concludes the negotiation efficiently."
