"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be able to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than he's currently offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. $13,500 is closer to my minimum, but I'm hoping for a bit more.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm also starting to consider selling to John if the negotiations with Bob don't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13800}
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower counteroffer this time, hoping to get closer to a deal.  $13,800 is a small decrease from my last offer but still keeps some buffer above my minimum. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. It's still significantly less than my initial offer and I believe I can push for a better price.  However, time is running out, and selling to John is becoming a more appealing option. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'm prepared to sell to John if the negotiations don't improve."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13600}
```

I'm making another small concession with a counteroffer of $13,600. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I want to see if Bob will meet me halfway.  I'm also realizing that with only a few rounds left, I need to be more flexible.  This is a fair price considering the previous offers and the remaining time, but I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer.  It's getting closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a slightly better price.  I'll make one last counteroffer in the next round. If Bob rejects it, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

This is my final offer. It's just above my minimum and I'm willing to accept it if Bob agrees. If he rejects, I'll sell to John for $10,000.  It's a risk, but I'm confident I can get a better price than that from John if I'm patient enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is it.  I'm out of time and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While I'd like to get more, selling to John for $10,000 is the best option now.  It's a guaranteed sale and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
