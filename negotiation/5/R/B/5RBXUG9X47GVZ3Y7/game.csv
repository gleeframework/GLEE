"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $14,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, and I'll offer $12,000.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you even closer to the middle, but I still need to make a profit. I'll consider $13,500, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can shake on it.",13500.0,Alice,5,
