# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still within your budget. However, there's always room for negotiation, and you want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking to invest less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the benefits it can bring. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue bargaining and potentially get a lower price.  You have a good buffer with your budget, and you don't want to rush into a deal that might not be the best possible."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to invest within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1075000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the benefits it can bring. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:** Alice has clearly stated this is her lowest price, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal. 
* **Good price:** $1,075,000 is still within your budget and significantly lower than the price John is offering. 
* **Opportunity cost:** The longer you negotiate, the greater the chance you'll lose the product to another buyer or Alice might withdraw her offer entirely.

By accepting this offer, you get a good deal while securing the product."
