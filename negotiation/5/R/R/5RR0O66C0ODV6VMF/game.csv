"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.  What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 as a starting point for our negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  Let me know what you think.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the  $950,000 offer is still too low for me to consider. I'm open to finding a middle ground. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,600,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that this product is valuable to you, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your price point.  Would you consider $1,100,000? I believe this offer represents a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal.  While $1,100,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from what I had in mind.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know your decision.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
