Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the  $950,000 offer is still too low for me to consider. I'm open to finding a middle ground.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal.  While $1,100,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from what I had in mind.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer. While she's come down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $1,400,000.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $1,000,000 makes more financial sense."
