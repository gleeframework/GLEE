"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer,  $12,500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you've mentioned. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice! However, I'm still a bit above $13,250. Would you be willing to go as low as $12,800? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my budget.",12800.0,Bob,4,
