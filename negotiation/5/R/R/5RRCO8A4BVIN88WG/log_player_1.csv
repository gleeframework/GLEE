"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired selling price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that you're willing to compromise.
* **Anchoring:** A high initial offer can ""anchor"" the negotiation, influencing Bob's perception of the product's value and his counteroffers.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and allows me to adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price and the product's actual value to him. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss.  It's important to demonstrate that I'm unwilling to settle for such a low price. Proceeding to the next round allows me to counter and continue negotiating for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but that offer is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  While I rejected Bob's low offer, it's crucial to demonstrate some flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Significant Reduction:**  Lowering the price by $300,000 indicates a willingness to move towards a deal but maintains a strong position.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps the price well above my minimum, allowing room for further negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe is achievable and less than I can get from John. By continuing to negotiate, I can try to push for a price closer to $1,750,000 or at least above my $1,500,000 minimum.  I'm willing to leverage the guaranteed offer from John if Bob isn't willing to meet me closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While your offer is closer, I need to see something closer to $1,750,000 for this deal to make sense."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer aims for a price roughly halfway between his last offer ($1,250,000) and my previous ask ($2,000,000). This strategy can signal a willingness to compromise while still striving for a strong profit.
* **Clear Target:** I'm explicitly stating a target number to guide Bob's next offer. This reinforces my position and sets a clear expectation.
* **Time Constraint:** With fewer rounds remaining, I'm applying a bit more pressure and indicating that time is a factor in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,750,000 is still quite high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price and what John is offering. While I could try to push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or stall, leaving me with a less favorable outcome. Accepting this offer ensures I achieve my minimum target and avoids the potential for losing out on a sale entirely."
