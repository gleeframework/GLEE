```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,500 is still a bit more than I can do right now.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about $9,250? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy the product from John. Alice is getting closer to your price but is still above your maximum budget. At this point, it's better to secure the product for a price you're comfortable with, rather than risk going further into the negotiation and potentially missing out on a good deal."
