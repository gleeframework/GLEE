"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $10,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and a price that is higher than what Bob thinks it's worth, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while also making it clear I'm serious about selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,500 is still a bit more than I can do right now.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to see if I can get a bit more from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about $9,250? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
