It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price.  $18,000 is above your maximum budget, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best first step."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $13,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice is getting closer to my price range, but $16,500 is still a bit too high. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

I'm raising my offer to $14,500. This is still a bit below my maximum budget, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to meet her halfway. Hopefully, she'll accept this offer."

Alice seems unwilling to come down further, and $16,000 is still above my maximum budget.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $15,000."
