{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. I know it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to make this deal happen for a price of $1,400,000. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** While I know I have John as a backup, I want to maximize my profit with Bob. Starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant gain.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning I'm willing to ""make this deal happen,"" I subtly imply that this offer is time-sensitive, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $100,000 less than Bob's value allows for some back-and-forth if Bob wants to negotiate. This increases the chance of closing the deal at a price higher than John's offer."
