"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 is still a bit low for me. How about $100?  That's my minimum price, and it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's close this deal!",100.0,Alice,5,
