"Hi Alice, thanks for offering. While I agree the product looks great, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget considerations, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $7,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.",7000.0,Bob,4,
