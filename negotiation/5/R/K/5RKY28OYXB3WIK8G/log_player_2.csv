"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $115. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum price of $120.  You can get the product from John for $120, which is your limit, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and go with John."
