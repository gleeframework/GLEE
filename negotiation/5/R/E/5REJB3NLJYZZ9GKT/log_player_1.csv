I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000.  This is a good deal for both of us:

* **For me:** I still get a good price, close to my minimum acceptable offer.
* **For Bob:** He gets a good deal, as the product is worth $800,000 to him. 

If he rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, but I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob if possible."
