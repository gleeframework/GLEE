Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

We're still above John's offer, and have room to negotiate. Let's see how much Bob is willing to budge."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

We're getting close to John's offer, but Bob's increments are getting smaller. I'll push one more time to gauge his seriousness."

Bob has been very consistent about staying at or below $1,200,000.  It's unlikely he will move significantly from this point. Accepting his offer would be a $200,000 loss compared to John's offer. It's time to move on to John."
