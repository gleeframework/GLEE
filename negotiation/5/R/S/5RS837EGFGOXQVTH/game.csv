"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $10,500.  This still gives you a great value, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This would allow us to both get a fair deal. ",10000.0,Bob,4,
