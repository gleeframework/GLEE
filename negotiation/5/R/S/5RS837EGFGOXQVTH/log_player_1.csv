"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than my minimum value of $10,000.  I believe I can get a better price from Bob or from John, so I'm going to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $10,500.  This still gives you a great value, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This would allow us to both get a fair deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum price.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal.  It's a fair price for both of us."
