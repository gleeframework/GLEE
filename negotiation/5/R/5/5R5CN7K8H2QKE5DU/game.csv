"Bob, I'm excited to offer you first crack at a truly unique product. Given its value, I'm setting the initial price at $2,000,000. I believe it's a steal at this price, considering its potential return for you. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but closer to $1,200,000 would be more realistic. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is substantial. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,750,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider $1,400,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $1,400,000 is pushing it. How about we make it $1,600,000 and call it a deal?",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I can tell this product is important to you, and I'm willing to go a bit higher than my last offer. How about we settle at $1,475,000?  That's my final offer.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
