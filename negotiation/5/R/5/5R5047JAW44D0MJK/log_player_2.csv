"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [product name] for a price of $950,000. This product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price represents a fair and mutually beneficial deal.  If you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $800,000. Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer. However, this could be a negotiating tactic.
* Your absolute maximum price is $1,000,000 (from John).  
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or get the product for $1,000,000 from John if she's bluffing. 

**It's always better to try for a lower price, especially since Alice's offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product.**"
