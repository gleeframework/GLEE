Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to my budget. Would you consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  I could meet you halfway at $15,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.
