"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $130 is quite low for the value this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested but $170 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $145? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",145.0,Bob,4,
