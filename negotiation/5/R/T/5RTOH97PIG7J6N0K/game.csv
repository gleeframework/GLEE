"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. While I value your interest, $10,500 is significantly below its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $13,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider $11,000?  I feel that's a fair offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product is worth the investment.  Let's settle at $12,500 and close the deal. This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
