"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my valuation and your desired selling point. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is quite high and $1,900,000 is a fair reflection of that. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,500,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
