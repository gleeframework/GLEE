Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate, given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a slightly better deal. I will counteroffer with a slightly higher price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still leaves some room for profit. This strategy balances the risk of losing the deal with the potential of a better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and close to my desired price.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and ensure a quick sale."
