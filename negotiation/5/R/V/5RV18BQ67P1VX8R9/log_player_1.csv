"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point because:

* It's above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.
* It shows that I value the product and am not desperate to sell.

I'll be carefully observing Bob's response to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's only slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000,  I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. This is a reasonable price, and it's better than selling to John for a lower amount."
