"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can we meet somewhere in the middle of that and $9000?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8500 and $9000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm going to offer you the product for $8750. This is the best I can do, and I hope it's acceptable to you.",8750.0,Alice,5,
