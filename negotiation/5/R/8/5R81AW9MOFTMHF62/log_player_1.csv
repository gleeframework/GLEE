Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential $200,000 difference to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but remain realistic to avoid Bob rejecting the offer outright.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This represents a significant discount compared to its true worth to someone like you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,150,000 secures you a $150,000 profit over your minimum.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""unique value"" and offering a ""discount"" frames the price as advantageous to Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still keeping you well above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible offer.  You could start higher or lower depending on your risk tolerance and how you perceive Bob's negotiation style."
