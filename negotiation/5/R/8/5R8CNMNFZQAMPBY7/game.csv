"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,500.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $7,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $7,500, but I'll throw in a small bonus, which will bring the total price down to $7,250. It's a one-time offer, so you'll need to decide now.",7250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"That bonus is a nice touch, Alice, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. Would you consider $7,100?",7100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $7,100, Bob, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll make a slight adjustment to the bonus, and I'll sell the product to you for $7,150. It's a final offer, so think carefully before responding.",7150.0,Alice,7,
