"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't afford $12,000 right now. How about we aim for $9,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the current market and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just not workable for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which I believe is a fair compromise.  It still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering your position, I would like to propose $10,000 as a counteroffer. This price aligns better with my budget while still acknowledging the value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
