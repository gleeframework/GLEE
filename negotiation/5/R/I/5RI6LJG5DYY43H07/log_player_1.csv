"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000.  This is significantly more than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if needed.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested in buying the product and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can get more.  I'm not desperate to sell and want to maximize my profit. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is still a decent amount above my minimum and shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's also closer to Bob's offer, signaling a possible compromise. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is too low. While it's tempting to accept given the limited time, it's not worth it to lose $200,000. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground.  It's still early in the negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for that amount yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, showing I'm serious about finding a deal.  It's still above my minimum and only $50,000 below John's offer.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where Bob sees the value and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting significantly lower, and we are running out of time.  While I could counteroffer again, I'm concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement that satisfies me. Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
