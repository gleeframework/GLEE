"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.  If you're not interested, I'm confident I can sell it to someone else for $10,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is above your maximum price and she's trying to create a false sense of urgency. You can get the product for a better price from John."
