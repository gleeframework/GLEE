"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to my asking price, it's still a bit below my minimum expectation.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be compensated for the product's true worth. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll accept $950,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
