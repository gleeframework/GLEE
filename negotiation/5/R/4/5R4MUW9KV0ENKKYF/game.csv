"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think you'll find very reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price given my maximum value for this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. However, I'm prepared to go up to $1,250,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not quite ready to accept $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can seal the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly value your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is a significant improvement, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm ready to offer $1,275,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
