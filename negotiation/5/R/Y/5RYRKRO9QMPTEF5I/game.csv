"Thanks for the offer, Alice! $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $92.50. Let's make this happen!",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $92.50 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's make this work.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $88 just doesn't work for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is my final offer.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $89?  That's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.",89.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but $89 just doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet me here, I'll have to sell the product to another buyer.",90.0,Alice,7,
