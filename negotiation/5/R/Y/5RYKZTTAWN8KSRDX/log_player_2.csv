"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. This is a great price considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a profit as well. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

It's better to reject Alice's offer. You can get the product from John for a lower price ($1,000,000), saving yourself $150,000."
