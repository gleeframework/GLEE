Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I know it's valuable to you, so I'm proposing a price of $10,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for the highest possible price that Bob might accept maximizes potential profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) increases the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Backup Plan:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a bolder offer to Bob.

**Explanation:**

This offer attempts to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal. By offering a price significantly lower than Bob's perceived value but higher than your minimum, you create a win-win situation."
