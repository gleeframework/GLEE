"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $170 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to come down to $140? ",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $145 for it. ",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we try $160? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",160.0,Alice,5,
