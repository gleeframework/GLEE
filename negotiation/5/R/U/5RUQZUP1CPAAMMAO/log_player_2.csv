"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are looking to save as much money as possible, and $9,000 is still too high. You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about $7,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $8500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is closer to your desired price range, you still have room to negotiate and can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer will allow you to continue negotiating and hopefully save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000. This is a fair price that we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $8700. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,700 is a decent price, you are still within your budget and have the potential to get it lower.  Continue negotiating to see if you can get Alice to agree to your desired price.  You have a few rounds left, so there's no need to rush into accepting this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,700 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,200.  I think that's a reasonable price for both of us, and it's a good starting point for us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8200 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to compromise again. I'm counteroffering at $8500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've reached a point where Alice is unlikely to budge much further, and you are getting close to your ideal price range. It's more advantageous to accept the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation. While you might get it down a little more, the potential savings are not worth the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer or the possibility of losing the deal entirely. Remember, you only have 3 rounds left before you're forced to buy from John, so it's prudent to secure the deal now."
