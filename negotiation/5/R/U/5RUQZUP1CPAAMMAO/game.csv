,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about $7500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $8500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8000. This is a fair price that we can both agree on.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $8700. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product.",8700.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8700 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8200.  I think that's a reasonable price for both of us, and it's a good starting point for us to close this deal.",8200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8200 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to compromise again. I'm counteroffering at $8500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product.",8500.0,Alice,7,
