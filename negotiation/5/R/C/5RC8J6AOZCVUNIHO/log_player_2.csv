"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefit you'll gain, I think a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above your budget of $10,000.  It's worth exploring negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price point. You have more rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a better strategy to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it gives you a good return as well."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $14,000?  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. You still have 5 rounds left to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to see if you can get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $13,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}
