"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefit you'll gain, I think a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and creates the impression the product might be worth more to Bob.
* **Anchoring:**  The high initial price acts as an anchor. Even though Bob's value is lower, the initial price can influence his perception of a ""reasonable"" counter-offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The large gap between the initial price and Bob's perceived value leaves ample room for counter-offers and reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value, which was expected. Accepting now would leave a lot of money on the table. We have room to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to our desired minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $16,000?"", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While we didn't accept Bob's offer, we're showing flexibility by making a significant price reduction from $22,000 to $16,000. This signals our willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting Halfway (Perceived):** Framing the counteroffer as ""meeting halfway"" can be persuasive, even though it's not mathematically accurate. It encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable offer.
* **Above Minimum:**  The $16,000 offer is still comfortably above our $15,000 minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it gives you a good return as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Enough:** Bob increasing his offer to $12,000 shows he's willing to negotiate. However, we're still below our minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiating Leverage:** We have John as a backup option, which gives us leverage. We can afford to be a bit more assertive in pursuing a better price from Bob.
* **Time Remaining:** With several rounds left, we have room for a few more counteroffers to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $14,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's current offer ($12,000) and our previous ask ($16,000). This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.
* **Close to Our Minimum:** $14,000 is very close to our $15,000 minimum. While we're leaving some potential profit on the table, securing the deal is becoming increasingly important. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By continuing to negotiate and make concessions, we keep Bob engaged and signal our desire to find an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $13,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $13,000 is only $2,000 below our initial asking price and a decent profit over our minimum. While we could try to push for more, it's getting riskier.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  At this point, the potential gain from further negotiation is likely to be small, and the risk of Bob walking away increases. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means getting paid sooner. Delaying for a potentially small gain might not be worth it. 
* **Relationship:** Accepting this offer might leave Bob feeling like he got a reasonably good deal, potentially fostering goodwill for future interactions."
