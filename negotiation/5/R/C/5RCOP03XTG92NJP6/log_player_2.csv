# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm proposing a special offer of $95 for it. This price not only ensures you get a great deal but also allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. Considering its worth to you is $80, this seems like an excellent opportunity for both of us. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.
