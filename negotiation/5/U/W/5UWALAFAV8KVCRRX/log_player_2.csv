It's better to try to get a better price from Alice.  There's a lot of room for negotiation since she values the product at $1,000,000 and is already offering it for $900,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's more appealing to me while still being a reasonable offer for Alice given her own valuation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a significant savings compared to John's price and still a reasonable profit for her. Accepting her offer is the best decision at this point."
