"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand that budgets can be tight, and I respect your position. However, after careful consideration, I would like to make a counteroffer. I am willing to negotiate further, but I must maintain the integrity of our product's value. Therefore, I propose to sell the product to you for $875000. This price still reflects the product's worth while allowing for a reasonable compromise. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",875000.0,Alice,3,
