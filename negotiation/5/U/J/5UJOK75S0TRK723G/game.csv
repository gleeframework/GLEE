"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still leaves plenty of room for you to make a profit, while allowing me to get a fair price.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and compromise on the price. Can you consider $10,000? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement here.",10000.0,Bob,4,
