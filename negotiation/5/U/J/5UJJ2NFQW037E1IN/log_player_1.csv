Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise:

* **For Alice:** It's significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.
* **For Bob:** It's still a good deal as he values the product at $12,000, so he's getting a discount. 

This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a decent profit for Alice."
