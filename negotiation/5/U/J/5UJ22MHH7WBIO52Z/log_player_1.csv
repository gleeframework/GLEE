"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is genuinely interested and has the potential to offer a price closer to my desired value. It also gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** for now. While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired value. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,400,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my initial offer.  I believe this demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price point I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** again.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, I still believe there's room for a better deal.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, potentially moving closer to Bob's price, but I'm not ready to settle for $1,200,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,350,000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I'm still trying to maximize my profits.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly higher price.  There are only a few rounds left, so I'm going to have to be more strategic in my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter-offer at $1,250,000. This is a significant move closer to Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince him to accept. With only a few rounds left, I need to make a decision soon.  I'm still hoping to get a little more, but I'm also aware that I might have to settle for a lower price if I want to avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm feeling the pressure now with only two rounds left. However, I'm still holding out hope that we can close a deal at a slightly higher price. I'm going to make one final counteroffer in the next round. If it's rejected, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1220000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I've brought the price down to $1,220,000.  It's a significant concession from my previous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to it.  If he rejects, I'll have no choice but to sell to John in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is the final round. I have to make a decision.  While I would prefer a higher price, it's better to accept Bob's offer of $1,180,000 than sell to John for $1,000,000. I've managed to get a better price than John's offer, and it's better than risking getting nothing. I'm accepting Bob's offer."
