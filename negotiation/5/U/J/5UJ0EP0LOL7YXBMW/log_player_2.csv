"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?

Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'll make a new counteroffer of $850,000.
