"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but we're willing to start negotiations at $130. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a different price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal.  He should reject the offer and counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $125.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his own valuation as possible.  He's starting with a small counteroffer, but still above Alice's valuation,  to see if she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, we would like to counter with a price of $128. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while still being competitive. Please let us know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer. At $128, the deal is still within Bob's budget and only $8 more than Alice's valuation.  This is a good compromise, and Bob should accept the offer."
