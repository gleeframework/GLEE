"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price up to $8,000 for the product. I understand the value of the item, but I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $17,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still believe that $8,000 represents a fair price for the product. I would like to keep our negotiation at that figure if possible.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I'm afraid we're too far apart on price. I'm willing to make one final offer at $15,500. This is a significant reduction and the lowest I can go. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",15500.0,Alice,5,
