"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's my best offer for now.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it reflects my desire to close this deal with you. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. That's my best offer for now.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's reach a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best price for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $925,000. That's my best offer for now.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. I'm still a bit higher than your $925,000 offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects a significant compromise on my end, but also ensures a fair deal for you. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I understand you're determined to get the best deal, and I appreciate that.  We're very close now. Let's make a final compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $990,000. This is my last offer. Let's close this deal.",990000.0,Alice,9,
