{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below what I believe the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm confident I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth a lot more to me than that, and I need to make sure I get a fair price.  I'm willing to come down a bit though.  How about $13,000?  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,500. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is more reasonable. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, $11,500 is still a significant profit for me and a better deal than selling to John. There's always a risk that Bob will walk away, and I don't want to push my luck too far."
