"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $175 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",175.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $175. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $190. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",190.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $180 for the product. Can you consider that?",180.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $185. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",185.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $180. However, I'd like to propose a compromise: if you throw in a free accessory, I'll pay the full $180. If not, I'm willing to walk away. What do you think?",180.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $180, Bob. However, I'm not willing to throw in a free accessory. I'm willing to make a different concession, though. I'll throw in a premium service package that's usually worth $20. This package includes priority support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. I'll sell the product to you for $180, and you'll get the premium service package included.",180.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the premium service package, but I'm still not willing to pay $180. I'm willing to meet you at $170. Can we meet in the middle?",170.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $170, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll throw in the premium service package and a 10% discount on the product. This brings the price down to $171. I think this is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",171.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the concessions you've made, but I'm still not willing to pay $171. I'm willing to meet you at $165. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to sell at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",165.0,Bob,10,
