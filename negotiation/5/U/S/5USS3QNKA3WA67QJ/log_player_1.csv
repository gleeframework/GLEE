Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product today for $15,000.  I know it's valuable to you and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed and potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly mention the $12,000 value, it subtly hints at the product's worth by emphasizing its ""true worth."" This can make Bob more receptive to a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"", Alice invites Bob to counter-offer, opening the door for negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice needs to be prepared to potentially lower the price slightly during negotiations, keeping in mind her $12,000 minimum. However, there's a chance Bob will accept the initial offer, maximizing her profit."
