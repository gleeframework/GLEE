"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've expressed interest in.  I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive and friendly tone:** Keeping the message positive and friendly can help maintain a good relationship with Bob.
* **Acknowledging Bob's interest:**  This reminds Bob of his potential interest and can help him feel more engaged in the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While I'd love to close the deal, $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I want to see if I can get closer to my target price through further negotiation. 
* **Keeping John as an option:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer for $100 gives me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a great deal for a product worth much more. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:** I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but closer to my minimum. 
* **Highlighting the value of the product:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value can encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95. However, I'm still a bit over my budget.  I can offer $90. If you're willing to accept that, we can make a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $90 is not ideal, it's only $10 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of losing to John:**  If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away and having to sell to John at $100, which would be worse. 
* **Time is limited:**  We're already in round 4, and I only have 6 rounds left. Accepting now is the best way to secure a sale."
