"Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant long-term benefits. How about we meet halfway at $1,200,000? This reflects the true value of what's on offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is as high as I'm willing to go.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still aiming for a figure closer to my initial valuation.  Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",950000.0,Bob,6,
