{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130.  It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price, but still potentially attractive to Bob.  We'll see how he reacts and then adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum, so I'm going to reject it and try to counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest, but I can't go that low.  How about $125?  It's still a good deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $115? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement that meets my needs. It's better to sell to John and guarantee my minimum price."
