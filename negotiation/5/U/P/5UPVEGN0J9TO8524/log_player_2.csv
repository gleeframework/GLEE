Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $100 either. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make a sale.

Alice's offer of $130 is still too high for me. Even though she's willing to compromise, it's approaching my maximum budget. To avoid any further negotiation and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll buy from John for $100."
