"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $175. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to me.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $100 either. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make a sale.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $137.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about $115?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $130? It's getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to swallow my pride to make a sale.",130.0,Alice,5,
