Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. This will give us a good starting point to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, as there is still potential to reach a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,800 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,200. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to recoup some of the value I put into this product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8200 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7900. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,900 is closer to my minimum price of $8,000, it's still not enough. I believe I can get a better price from Bob with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the sense we're both willing to compromise.  How about $8,100? It's a fair middle ground and would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $8100 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer still below my minimum, I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,000,  the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and potentially losing out on a sale is too high."
