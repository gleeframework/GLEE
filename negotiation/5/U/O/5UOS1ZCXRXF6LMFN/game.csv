"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7800. Can you consider that?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7800 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8200. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to recoup some of the value I put into this product. Let's make this happen.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm getting the sense we're both willing to compromise.  How about $8100? It's a fair middle ground and would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,7,
