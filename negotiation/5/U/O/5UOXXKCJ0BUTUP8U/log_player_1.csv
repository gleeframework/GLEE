Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value of $8,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. I'm hoping to get as close to the maximum value possible for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable value, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer completely.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
