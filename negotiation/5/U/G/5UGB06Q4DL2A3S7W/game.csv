"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value it brings to the table.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $10,000. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My revised offer is $12,500. I think this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. While $12,500 is getting closer, it's still out of my price range.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000, which I believe is a fair and final compromise, considering the value of the product and my budget.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. My revised offer is $13,000. I think this is the best compromise we can reach, considering the product's value and my minimum price.",13000.0,Alice,7,
