Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $100, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It's a strong starting point:**  By starting high, you leave yourself room to negotiate down if necessary.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, you still have room to negotiate with Bob.  You can try a counteroffer that splits the difference or is closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it for $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $87 is not your ideal price, it's still above your minimum of $80 and much closer to what Bob is willing to pay. It's a reasonable compromise that avoids further negotiation and secures a sale."
