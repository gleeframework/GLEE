"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's unique features and value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1050000. This is the highest I can go, but I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is a fair price for this product. Considering its unique features and value, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1080000. This is a reasonable price that still reflects the product's worth.

"I understand your persistence, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1000000. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm offering $1000000, and this is my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $1000000 is still too low for me. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, and I'm thinking of a price of $1120000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1120000.0,Alice,7,
