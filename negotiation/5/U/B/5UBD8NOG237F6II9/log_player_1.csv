Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it signals to Bob that I believe the product is valuable and I'm not willing to give it away cheaply.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play ball at a high price. 

If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his response. I'll always have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if I feel like I'm not getting a good enough deal."
