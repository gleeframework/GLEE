"Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm not able to meet the price of $1,200,000. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I acknowledge the value you place on the product, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if you're open to this revised offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
