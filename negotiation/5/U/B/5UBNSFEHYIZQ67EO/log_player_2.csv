"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $800,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value this product holds for me. However,  $900,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the potential value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm still looking to get as close to the true value of the product as possible. Considering its worth $1,200,000 to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point.  I can get the product from John for my target price, so that's the best option for me."
