"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a limited budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $18000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit short on budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $16000. I think that's a fair price, considering the value this product brings",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000",13000.0,Bob,6,
