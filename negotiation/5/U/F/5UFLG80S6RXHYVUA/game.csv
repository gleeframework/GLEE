"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product is valuable, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point. How about we settle at $975,000? It's a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm now offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a reasonable price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell we're both motivated to make a deal.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $1,012,500?",1012500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1,012,500. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm offering it to you for $1,025,000.
