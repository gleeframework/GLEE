"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done.",10750.0,Alice,3,
