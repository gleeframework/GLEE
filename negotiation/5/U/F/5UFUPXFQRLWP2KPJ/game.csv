"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $95? That's still a great price for a product worth $120 to me.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $92.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,5,
