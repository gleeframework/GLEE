I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $95? That's still a great price for a product worth $120 to me."", ""product_price"": 95}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While I'm close to a deal with Bob, I've only got a few rounds left and it's not guaranteed we'll come to an agreement. I'd rather take the sure thing and get my minimum price."
