Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $115 is more than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $120, so there's room for you to go up a little if necessary. 
* **It's a fair starting point:**  $115 is a reasonable price, considering the product's value to Bob. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum.  I need to try and get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is my lowest price.  If you're still interested, let's make a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price to $105.  This is still above my minimum and gives Bob a bit of a discount, hopefully making him more likely to accept."
