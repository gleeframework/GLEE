"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to start the negotiations at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work. Would you be willing to consider that figure?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
