Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product that I know you see significant value in.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for some negotiation downward if Bob pushes back. 
* **Consider the Alternative:** Alice has a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. Offering the product significantly lower than $1,450,000 would be leaving money on the table.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:**  If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even higher to leave more room for concessions.
* **Relationship Importance:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is crucial, Alice might consider a slightly lower price to foster goodwill."
