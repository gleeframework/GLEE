Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting further away from my desired price. I've already had several rounds of negotiation and it seems we're at an impasse.  To avoid further risks of getting a lower offer and with a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, it's time to sell to John."
