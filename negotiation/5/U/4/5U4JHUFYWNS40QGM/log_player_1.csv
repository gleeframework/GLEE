{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $13,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while also keeping the deal attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Could you consider meeting me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's also clear he's committed to buying the product at this price. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
