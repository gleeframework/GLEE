"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $102.50 is a fair price for me. I can go up to $95, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That way, we both get a fair price and we can close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still a bit short of what I'm willing to pay. How about $98? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",98.0,Bob,6,
