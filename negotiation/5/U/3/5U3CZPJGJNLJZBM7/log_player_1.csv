Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $102.50 is a fair price for me. I can go up to $95, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That way, we both get a fair price and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still a bit short of what I'm willing to pay. How about $98? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $98 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure sale.  John is offering me my minimum, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
