"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  To buy the product for the lowest possible price.
* **Alice's Offer:** $8,000, which is the same price Bob can get from John.
* **Best Option:** Rejecting Alice's offer gives Bob no advantage. However, it keeps the option of negotiating with Alice in the future open. 

By rejecting, Bob maintains his leverage and doesn't immediately commit to a price that might be higher than necessary."
