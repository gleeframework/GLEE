"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose we set the price at $140. This offers a fair compromise while still ensuring a good return for me. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $120. You want to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to consider my budget. However, $140 is still a bit outside of what I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am willing to meet you halfway on this. My counteroffer is $135 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $120. You want to save as much as possible and know you have the option to buy from John for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $125. This price would allow me to buy the product and still stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your situation, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. Considering our previous discussions, I am prepared to offer the product at $130. This price allows for a reasonable profit while still being within your budget constraints. I hope this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than your maximum budget of $120. While it's closer than her previous offers, you've already made two counteroffers and haven't been able to get her to lower the price further.  

Since you can buy the product from John for $120, it makes the most sense to buy it from him and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
