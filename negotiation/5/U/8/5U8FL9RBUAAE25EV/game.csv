"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $13,000 is fair. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. This is a fair price for me, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can agree on this price.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,250. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,250 is still lower than I'd like.  Would you consider $10,750? This would be a fair compromise.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,375. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",10375.0,Bob,6,
