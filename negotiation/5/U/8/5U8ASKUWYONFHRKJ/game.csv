"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose details about its exact nature, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm confident this product could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $2000000, a price that reflects its potential. This is a one-time offer, so consider it carefully. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a guaranteed $1500000.  Let me know your decision.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
