"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $140 is still too much for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $110? It's a fair compromise and we can both be happy.",110.0,Bob,4,
