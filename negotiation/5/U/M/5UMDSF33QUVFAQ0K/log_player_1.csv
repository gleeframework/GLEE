"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible while still leaving room for negotiation.  This should encourage Bob to engage and potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000, and it gives me a significant profit while also being a step closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still a good deal for Bob, considering his perceived value. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept, as it's closer to his offer and I don't want to risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. It's a good deal for both of us and I'm hoping it will be the final step to closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offers getting closer to my minimum, I'm feeling the pressure. However, the profit margin is still small and I'm worried we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds. I'm also concerned that Bob might be playing hardball and isn't truly interested in the product at a price closer to my desired amount.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell to John for $800,000. While it's not the ideal outcome, it guarantees a profit and provides me with certainty and peace of mind."
