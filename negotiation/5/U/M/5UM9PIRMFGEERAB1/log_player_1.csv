"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting high, above my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down and still get a good deal. 
* **Fair Justification:**  I'm providing a reason for the price (value of the product) to make it seem more reasonable to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 
* **Not Too Aggressive:**  While it's a high offer, it's not outlandishly unreasonable, leaving space for a reasonable counteroffer. 

**Remember:** I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000, so I have a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $900,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I'm willing to accept. 
* **I have a better option:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a better deal than accepting Bob's offer right now.
* **Negotiation room:** I have several rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, given the product's value. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm not walking away completely. A counter-offer shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Moving Closer:**  I'm decreasing my price slightly, showing flexibility but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Fair Justification:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking for feedback from Bob to keep the negotiation open.

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer, but I'm prepared for more rounds of negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect the value of your product, I can't agree to $1,100,000. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a compromise. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Time Constraints:**  We're only in round 4, and there's a chance Bob may not budge further. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is still an option, accepting Bob's offer gets me an extra $50,000.

**Next Steps:** I'm accepting Bob's offer and finalizing the deal."
