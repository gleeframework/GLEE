```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

Bob is still trying to save money and $10,800 is still higher than his maximum budget. He'll try to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $10,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $10,800 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,200 is a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has a maximum budget of $10,000 and Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above that. Even though there are more rounds, it's likely that Alice will not budge further from her current offer. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John at his maximum budget rather than continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal."
