"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $850000? I believe this might align better with both our interests.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm still not willing to go below $920000, as I believe the product's value is worth it. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $885000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me here, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",885000.0,Alice,5,
