"Round 1

# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm able to spend at this time.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a good value for you, considering your own valuation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $15,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if I can get a lower price.  I'm still within my budget if I buy from John, so there's no immediate urgency to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price given the value of the product to both of us. This would allow us to reach a compromise and complete the transaction."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $15,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 1-year warranty, which adds significant value to the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16,000, considering the additional benefits you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering extra benefits, the price of $16,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price, or potentially explore other options with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the added extras, but $16,000 is still too much for me.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the additional benefits you've included.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're willing to meet me at $15,000, I'll throw in an additional 6 months of premium support, on top of the 1-year warranty I already offered. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $15,000 is still outside my budget of $10,000.  With only 3 rounds left, the chances of getting a lower price from Alice are slim.  It's now more prudent to buy from John for $10,000, ensuring I stay within my budget and avoid further negotiations."
