Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm able to spend at this time.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a good value for you, considering your own valuation.  What do you think?
