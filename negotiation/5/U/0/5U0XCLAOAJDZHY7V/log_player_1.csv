"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** I'm starting with $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value but still allows for potential profit.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging, highlighting the potential value to Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  See if he's willing to negotiate.
* **Leave room for bargaining:** I can adjust the price if needed in subsequent rounds.
* **Maintain a good relationship:**  A positive tone is important for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price. 

I'm confident that I can get a better offer from Bob, given his interest in the product. Selling to John at this point would guarantee me $15,000, but I'm aiming for a higher price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone, emphasizing the fairness of the proposed deal. 

By offering a middle ground, I aim to:

* **Show flexibility:** Indicate my willingness to negotiate.
* **Increase the chances of agreement:** A middle ground is often appealing to both parties.
* **Maintain momentum:** Keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm  determined to see if I can push Bob a little higher.  Selling to John would guarantee me $15,000, but I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still below my minimum. How about we settle at $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $10,000, which is only $500 more than Bob's latest offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing the benefits for both of us. 

By offering a slight increase, I'm aiming to:

* **Show flexibility:** Indicate my willingness to negotiate.
* **Increase the chances of agreement:** The gap between our offers is narrowing, making agreement more likely.
* **Maintain momentum:** Keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're now at round 6, and Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  Continuing the negotiation risks wasting valuable time and could result in a lower price.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob, I'm comfortable selling the product to John for $15,000, which guarantees my minimum desired profit."
