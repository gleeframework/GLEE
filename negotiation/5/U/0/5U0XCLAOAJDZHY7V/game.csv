"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still below my minimum. How about we settle at $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's make this deal happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,
