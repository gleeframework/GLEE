{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $80 to me, so Alice's offer is too high. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a lower price than my maximum value. This will test the waters and see how willing Alice is to negotiate."

Alice's offer is still too high, but she's coming down in price.  I'm going to reject her offer and see if I can get her down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
