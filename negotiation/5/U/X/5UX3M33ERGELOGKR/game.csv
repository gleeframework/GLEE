"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go at this point.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $1,350,000 for the product. This price still offers you a great deal, and it allows me to achieve my target.  Let me know if this works for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
