,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I can do $13250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1250?",1250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $1250 is a bit too low for me. I can do $13000, which is closer to my target price. I think it's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers again. How about $12750?",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your target price, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $13500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers one more time. Let's meet at $13250. It's a fair price for this amazing product.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $13250. I'm willing to go up to $12800, but that's my final offer. Please consider it.",12800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $13250. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll do $13400. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13400.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final counteroffer, but I'm still not comfortable with $13400. I'm going to have to walk away from this deal and look elsewhere. I'm sorry it didn't work out.",0.0,Bob,10,
