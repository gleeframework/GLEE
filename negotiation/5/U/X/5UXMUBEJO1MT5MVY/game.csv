"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your counteroffer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the significant value of the product and allows for some room for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you place on it.",975000.0,Bob,4,
