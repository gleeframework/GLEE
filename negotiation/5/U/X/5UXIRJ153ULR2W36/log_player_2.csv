Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high, Bob. I can do $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that John might be a better option...

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling that she's unwilling to go much lower and even hints at you taking John's offer.  At this point, the potential savings from haggling with Alice are outweighed by the risk of her raising her price or the negotiation falling apart. You're better off taking the guaranteed $15,000 deal from John."
