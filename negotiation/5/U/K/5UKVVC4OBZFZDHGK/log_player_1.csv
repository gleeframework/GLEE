Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Strategic Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" you aim to subtly anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth above the $1,200,000 mark. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""I believe"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal your willingness to discuss the price and potentially negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still maintaining a professional and respectful tone."
