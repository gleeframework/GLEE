"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm confident this product is valuable to me, and I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to consider it since I really want to make a deal with you. I'll meet you at $900,000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the sale. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to getting this product, and I'm willing to offer you $875,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",875000.0,Bob,6,
