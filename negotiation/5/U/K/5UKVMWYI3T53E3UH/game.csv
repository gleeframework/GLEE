"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of my product and allows you a substantial profit margin.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've given this some thought, and I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for you while staying within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
