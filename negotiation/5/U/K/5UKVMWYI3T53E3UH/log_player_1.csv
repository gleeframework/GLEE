"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a bit higher than its market value, but I believe its unique features are worth the investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still lower than what I can potentially get from Bob or John.  I believe there's room for negotiation with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of my product and allows you a substantial profit margin.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've given this some thought, and I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for you while staying within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has offered the minimum I'm willing to accept.  While I could potentially push for more, there's no guarantee he'll budge further.  Selling to John at $1,000,000 would be the same profit, but I'm trying to maximize my chances of a faster deal.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and successful sale."
