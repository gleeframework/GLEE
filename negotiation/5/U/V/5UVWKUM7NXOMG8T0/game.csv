"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a competitive price of $22,000. I believe it offers significant value, even above the asking price.  What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $22,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's worth. What do you say?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18,000. However, I'm still only able to offer $10,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the fact that I can buy the product from John for $8,000 if we don't come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I understand your constraints.  How about we settle at $14,000? This is my final offer, as it's already a significant compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
