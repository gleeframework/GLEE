"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it!  I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $150 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $120. Therefore, it's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower price:** Bob is offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.
* **Clear message:** Bob expresses interest in the product but provides a concrete counteroffer.
* **Negotiation range:**  $110 is within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $110 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $120.  While it's a compromise from her previous offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price, potentially closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** Bob is now offering his maximum price, clearly communicating his limit.
* **Justification:**  He reinforces his budget constraint to encourage Alice to accept.
* **Positive tone:** Despite pushing for a lower price, Bob maintains a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
