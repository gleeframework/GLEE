"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it!  I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
This offer starts high, acknowledging my minimum value while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hopeful Bob will see value in the product, and this gives us a good starting point for bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $110?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $120. I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations with Bob, hoping to get a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $110 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $120 is exactly my minimum value.  While I'd love to get more, it's a good deal and I don't want to risk losing this sale by continuing to negotiate."
