# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be thrilled with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $9,000 is a better price than the original offer, Bob can still try to get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He has already shown a willingness to compromise, so there's a good chance Alice will come down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to buy the product without breaking the bank.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $8700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While $8,700 is still a bit more than he was originally hoping to pay, it's a significant improvement from her initial offer.  He's saved $1,300 compared to buying from John, and it seems likely that Alice is firm on her price.  Further negotiation might not result in a significantly better deal, and could risk losing the opportunity altogether."
