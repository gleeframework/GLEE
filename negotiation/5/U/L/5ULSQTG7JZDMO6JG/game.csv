"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your absolute limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
