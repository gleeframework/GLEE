"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $900,000 is still too high.  It makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your absolute limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's ideal price:**  $875,000 is only $25,000 more than Bob's counteroffer.
* **It's a good compromise:**  Alice has already moved closer to Bob's desired price. 
* **Time is a factor:** There are 7 rounds left, but there's no guarantee that Alice will continue to lower her price, or that Bob will get a better offer from John.  It's risky to continue negotiating.

By accepting, Bob saves $125,000 compared to buying from John."
