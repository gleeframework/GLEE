"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to see how much Alice is willing to come down. A starting offer of $75 gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $100 limit. 
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:**  We want to keep the conversation friendly and collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $75 is too low for me. Could you do $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Negotiating:**  Alice came down from $150 to $120, indicating a willingness to bargain. 
* **Still Room for Improvement:** $120 is still above our $100 limit and our initial offer of $75. We can likely negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $75 might have been a bit low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price that's directly in the middle of our last offer ($75) and Alice's counteroffer ($120). This shows we're willing to compromise.
* **Staying Competitive with John:** Our offer of $95 is still $5 cheaper than buying from John, maintaining our incentive to negotiate with Alice.
* **Approaching Our Limit:** While we want the best price, we're getting closer to our $100 maximum. A deal at $95 would be a good outcome."
