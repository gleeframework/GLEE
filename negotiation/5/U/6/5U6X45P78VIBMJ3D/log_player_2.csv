This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is at her bottom line:** She's revealed the product is worth $1,200,000 to her and is unlikely to go any lower. 
* **You're getting a good deal:** You're buying the product for $300,000 less than your maximum budget and $100,000 less than John's offer.
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  You might be able to push Alice a little further, but there's no guarantee, and you risk her walking away from the deal entirely. 

Accepting now secures the product at a very favorable price."
