"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer to $1,200,000. I think this is the sweet spot for both of us, considering the value you place on the product and my initial asking price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
