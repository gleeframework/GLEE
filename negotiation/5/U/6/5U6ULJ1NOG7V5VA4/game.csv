"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $105?  Let's make this happen.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm really trying to be flexible here. $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal right now. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
