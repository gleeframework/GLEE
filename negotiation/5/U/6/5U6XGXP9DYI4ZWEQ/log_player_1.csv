"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is an aggressive opening, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the following rounds. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is a good price, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll use this round to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. It's a mid-point between my initial offer and his counteroffer. This should keep the negotiation moving towards a deal while still leaving room to improve the price in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to my initial price point, $9,200 is a good price and it's only $200 less than my previous offer. I'd rather secure the deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or selling to John for $8,000."
