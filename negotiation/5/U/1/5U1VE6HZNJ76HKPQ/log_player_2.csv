"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. I know it's worth that much to you, and it's a fair price considering its value.  Of course, I'm open to negotiating, but I'm confident you'll find this a good deal. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is higher than John's price. By rejecting her offer,  Bob can signal that he's not willing to pay above his limit and potentially get a better deal from Alice in the next round of negotiation.  Worst case scenario, he can still buy it from John at a lower price."
