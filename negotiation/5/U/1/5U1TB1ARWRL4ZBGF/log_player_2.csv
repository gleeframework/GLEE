```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some flexibility on my end. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for me. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a good outcome. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. While I could continue negotiating, it's likely the price will not drop significantly lower.  It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000, as it's within my budget and a guaranteed deal."
