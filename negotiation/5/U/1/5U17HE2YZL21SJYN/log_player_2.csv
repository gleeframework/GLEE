"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your company. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price below its market value.  I understand this is a substantial investment, so please let me know if you have any questions.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
