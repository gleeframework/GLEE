"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your company. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price below its market value.  I understand this is a substantial investment, so please let me know if you have any questions.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
