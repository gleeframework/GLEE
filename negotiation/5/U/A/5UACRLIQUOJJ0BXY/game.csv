"Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own value of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to show good faith. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. It's still above my initial offer, and it's significantly closer to your desired price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to ensure I get a fair return.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this price.  If we can't, I'm ready to move on to another buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
