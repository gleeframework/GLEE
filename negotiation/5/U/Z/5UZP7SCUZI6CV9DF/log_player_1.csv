Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $100 (its value to me) and be guaranteed a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $99 is just below the $100 I'm guaranteed from John. It's a psychological pricing strategy making it seem like a ""deal"" compared to a round $100.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I haven't included explicit negotiation in this message,  Bob might counter-offer if he's interested but finds $99 too high. This leaves me the option to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
