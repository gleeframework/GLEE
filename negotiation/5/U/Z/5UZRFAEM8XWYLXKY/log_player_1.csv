Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose an offer of $8,200 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum threshold. I'm going to try and push for a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I understand your budget, $8,200 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for that low of a price. I'm going to try to push for a bit higher in the next round, but if I don't see progress, I might consider selling to John."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  We're getting closer, but $8,900 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to try one more counteroffer. If he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."

I've reached my limit with Bob. We're not making any real progress, and I'm running out of time.  I'm going to sell to John for $10,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than settling for a price that's too low."
