Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could result in a quicker sale and still net you a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $14,000 is a price point that:
    * Gives you a $2,000 profit margin.
    * Is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation if he tries to haggle. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and emphasizes value. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your negotiation style and Bob's personality (if you had more information about him), you might choose a different opening offer."
