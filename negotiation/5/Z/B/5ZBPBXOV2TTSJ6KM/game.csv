,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us, the product's value is truly above $1,200,000. Could you consider $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product's value is high, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
