"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations, valued at $15,000 to you. I'm offering it to you today at an exclusive price of $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering your willingness to pay $13,000, I am willing to accept $13,500 for the product. This is my final offer before moving forward with another potential buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $13,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's counteroffer:**  Bob offered $13,000, so $13,500 is a reasonable compromise.
* **Alice's offer is likely final:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer before moving on to another buyer.  Rejecting could lead to losing the deal altogether. 

While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer ensures a purchase within his budget and saves him $1,500 compared to buying from John."
