{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $175 is better than $150, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
``` 
I'll counter with $190.  It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is still fair, but I'm willing to be flexible to close the deal."
