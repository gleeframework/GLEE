Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to discuss the price further if you have any concerns."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for the highest price Bob might accept, which is just below your guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The message hints at potential flexibility while still anchoring the price near your desired point. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not explicitly mentioning John, there's a subtle implication that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.

This strategy attempts to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving a small window for him to counter-offer, maximizing your potential earnings."
