Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I believe you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I can still counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired $10,000 value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $10,500?  This would allow us both to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $10,000, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I have more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can potentially get a better deal by continuing the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're eager to close the deal. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to get this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
