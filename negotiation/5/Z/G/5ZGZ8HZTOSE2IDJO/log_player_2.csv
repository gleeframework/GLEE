"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $90, which is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $120.
* **Strategy:** Reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. 

Even though Bob can buy from John for $120, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first. There's a chance he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Get the product as close to his $80 valuation as possible.
* **Alice's Value:** $80, so a price of $75 is still profitable for her.
* **Strategy:**  A counteroffer of $75 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save money.
* **Alice's Offer:** $85, which is within Bob's acceptable range of $120.
* **Strategy:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice in this round.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he might end up having to buy from John for $120.  Accepting $85 is a good compromise, saving him $35 compared to John's price."
