"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to move closer to your price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This recognizes the value of the product while offering you a significant discount from my original offer.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value and my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's try this â€“ $985,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",985000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I've been flexible and tried to find a price that works for us both.  However, the value of this product is clear, and my bottom line is $975,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",975000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $920,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Bob,8,
