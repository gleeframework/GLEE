Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget.

Round 6

We're getting close, but Bob's increments are getting smaller. It's time to increase the pressure and signal that our price is firming up."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible and tried to find a price that works for us both.  However, the value of this product is clear, and my bottom line is $975,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $920,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. He's clearly unwilling to meet our price, and his increments are getting smaller. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which is significantly better than Bob's final offer of $920,000.  It makes the most business sense to take the guaranteed profit."
