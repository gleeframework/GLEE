,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we settle on $950000? It's a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy. ",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $925000 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $937500?  This is my best offer. ",937500.0,Alice,5,
