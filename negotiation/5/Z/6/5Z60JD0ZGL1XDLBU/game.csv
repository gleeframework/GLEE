"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it, which is still a good price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $130 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $110, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer it to you for $112. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $112 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $108, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $108 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is the last offer I'm willing to make, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",110.0,Alice,7,
