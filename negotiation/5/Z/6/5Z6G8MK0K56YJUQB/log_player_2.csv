Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000. This still leaves a significant margin for you, and allows me to get closer to my target. Let's see if we can find common ground here.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
