"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than her value of $800,000. As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. There is significant room for negotiation, so I will reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000, which is still a good profit for Alice while being significantly lower than her initial offer.  This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's lower than her original offer, it's still above the $900,000 counteroffer I made, and above my target of saving as much money as possible. I'll continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $950,000.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to move closer to her price but still  aiming to save a significant amount of money.  I believe there's still room for her to come down in her price without sacrificing her profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my target price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal by continuing to counter-offer.  I'm still prioritizing saving as much money as possible, and I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to settle for this price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,000,000.  This shows Alice that I'm getting closer to her price point. I believe that this offer is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful that Alice will accept it.  If she rejects, I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm getting closer to the point where I might consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for my desired savings.  It's closer to my last counteroffer, but it's still above my target price. I'll keep negotiating, but if she doesn't come down further, I might have to consider John's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,050,000. I'm getting closer to Alice's price but still trying to keep it below her last offer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm not willing to overpay. If she rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me, and I'm running out of time. I've made several counteroffers, and Alice hasn't shown much willingness to negotiate further.  I'm also concerned that if I reject her offer again, she may make an even higher counteroffer in the final round, pushing the price even further beyond my target.  Given the limited time and Alice's unwillingness to budge, I'm going to go ahead and buy the product from John for $1,500,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still within my budget and secures me the product."
