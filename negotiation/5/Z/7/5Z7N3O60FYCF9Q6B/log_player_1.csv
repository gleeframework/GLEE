Round 2

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but his pace is very slow. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $8,000 within the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer of $7,800 would be a loss compared to John's.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
