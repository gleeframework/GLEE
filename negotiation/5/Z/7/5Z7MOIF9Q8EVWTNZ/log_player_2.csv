"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This exceptional item is worth an incredible $12,000 to you, and I believe it could significantly enhance your life or business. I am offering this valuable asset to you for a special introductory price of $9,500. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a price that is more than reasonable, considering its true value. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly exaggerating the product's worth to you. While she's offering a discount, $9,500 is still more than you're willing to pay. By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll come down further or proceed with your backup plan of buying from John for $12,000."
