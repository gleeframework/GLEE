"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. To get things started, I'm offering it to you for $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $800,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to get a fair price and you to acquire a product you value at that amount. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $800,000, so I'll offer $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $775,000 still falls short of what I need.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $790,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's the best we can do.  Let's close this deal!",790000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm starting to think it's time to consider other options. I'll make one last offer: $780,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",780000.0,Bob,6,
