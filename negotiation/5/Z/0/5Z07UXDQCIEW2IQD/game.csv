"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I can't go as low as $140, but I'm willing to come down to $160. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $148 is still a little below what I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $150? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",150.0,Alice,7,
