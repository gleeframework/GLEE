"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $150? That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering. Can you consider this offer?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $130 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $140. How about $145? This would be a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",145.0,Alice,5,
