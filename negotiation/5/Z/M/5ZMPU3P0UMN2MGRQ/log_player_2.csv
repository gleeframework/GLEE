"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal. You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is willing to sell for $80. There's room for negotiation to find a price that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $90?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $105 is still above your ideal price point.  There's still room to negotiate and you can likely secure a lower price.  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is willing to sell for less than $105.  A counteroffer allows you to continue exploring a price that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. Let's try $95. I think this is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you at $98, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $98 is very close to your target price of $95.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will be firm at this point, especially since she stated it's her lowest price.  Accepting her offer saves you time and ensures you get the product at a good price, below your maximum limit of $120."
