Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  To maximize profit, we should aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation while staying above your minimum.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price of $130 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between securing the sale with Bob at a favorable price and ensuring you don't lose out by going too low initially."
