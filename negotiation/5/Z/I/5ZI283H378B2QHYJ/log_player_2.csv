"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better price. Alice is clearly trying to get a significant profit margin. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or see if she makes a better offer."
