"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe could significantly enhance your business operations or personal projects. Given its unique features and capabilities, I estimate its value to be well above $8000. I am extending this exclusive opportunity to you with an offer of $12000. This price reflects not only the product's intrinsic value but also the potential benefits it can bring to you. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any questions about how it can meet your specific needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget of $12,000. 
* Since John is also willing to sell the product for the same price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. 
* By rejecting, you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere."
