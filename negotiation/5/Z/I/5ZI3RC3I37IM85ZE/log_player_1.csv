Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($800,000), but it leaves room for negotiation while still being highly profitable for Alice. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, Alice creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
