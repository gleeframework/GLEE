"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price allows you a substantial profit while ensuring a fair return for me. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Even though you could potentially get it for $1,500,000 from John, accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000."
