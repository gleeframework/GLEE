Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing John offers a safety net of $150.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $130 allows for potential negotiation downwards while still staying significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message implies a willingness to negotiate by saying ""willing to offer,"" potentially leading Bob to counter-offer instead of outright rejecting.

This strategy aims to find a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob and ensuring a sale, avoiding the need to settle for John's $150 offer."
