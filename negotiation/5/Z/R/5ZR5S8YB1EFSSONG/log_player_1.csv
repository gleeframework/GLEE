"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, aiming to frame the high price as justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative (""mutually beneficial arrangement"") signaling my willingness to negotiate.

I'll adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was hoping we could come to a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than his perceived value ($800,000) signaling strong interest. While it's above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation to secure a higher price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is my fallback, but I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, I believe the true value of this product warrants a higher price. I'm proposing $2,100,000. This accounts for the value you'll gain and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm lowering my price by $200,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but not drastically. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I continue to reinforce the product's inherent value, justifying the higher price point.
* **Aiming for Middle Ground:** I'm strategically positioning my counteroffer between his offer ($1,800,000) and my previous ask ($2,300,000), seeking a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire to purchase the product. His latest offer is $1,950,000, which is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, I believe there's still a chance to negotiate a slightly better deal, especially considering we are only in Round 4."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. It's clear this product holds significant value for you. To move towards a final agreement, I'm proposing $2,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 2025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing my counteroffer by $75,000, signaling that I'm nearing my desired price point. 
* **Emphasis on Compromise and Fairness:**  The language focuses on finding a solution that benefits both parties, reinforcing the idea that this is a balanced deal.
* **Urgency (Subtle):**  While not explicitly stated, mentioning a ""final agreement"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to seriously consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll pay $1,900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point in the negotiation. Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is getting closer to my absolute minimum, but his language (""one more offer"") suggests he's nearing his limit. I need to decide if I'm willing to risk losing him to secure a slightly higher price.  I believe there's still some room to maneuver, and I'm willing to take a calculated risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and recognize your commitment to reaching a deal. Let's find a way to bridge this gap. I'm proposing a final price of $1,975,000. This represents a significant concession on my part and ensures you're getting this valuable product at a price that makes sense."",
""product_price"": 1975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm at a price point above Bob's last offer but making a smaller concession to show willingness to close the deal.
* **Finality:** By stating ""a final price,"" I'm communicating that this is my best and final offer.
* **Justification:** Highlighting it as a ""significant concession"" reminds Bob of my movement and frames the price as advantageous for him.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only a few rounds remaining, the implicit time pressure encourages a decision. 

This is a calculated risk. Bob may accept, but there's a chance he could walk away. However, it positions me for the best possible outcome at this stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I still believe the product is worth more, Bob is clearly unwilling to move much further. Accepting his offer of $1,925,000 secures a substantial profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in the final rounds. It's time to finalize the deal."
