Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $190. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 190}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a price of $190 offers a potential $40 profit over your minimum. This markup is significant but not exorbitant. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While your initial offer is $190, there's room for Bob to negotiate down if he's price-sensitive. This keeps the door open for a deal. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't know Bob's willingness to pay beyond $150. If you had more information about Bob, you could tailor your offer more strategically."
