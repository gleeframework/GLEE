Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $125. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin by offering the product at a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than John's guaranteed offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $125 offer leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and I can then decide whether to accept a slightly lower price or move on to John. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** This strategy prioritizes getting the highest possible price from Bob before resorting to the guaranteed sale with John."
