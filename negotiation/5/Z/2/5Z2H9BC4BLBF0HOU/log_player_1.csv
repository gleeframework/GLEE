Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we're getting close.  $8,900 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go to $8,800.  That's my final offer.  Let's make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $8,800 is below my desired price, it's only slightly less than my last offer, and there's a good chance Bob won't budge further.  Accepting his offer ensures a deal and minimizes the risk of him backing out completely. It's better to get $8,800 now than potentially lose out on the entire sale by continuing to negotiate."
