"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John.  You have room to bargain and can potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $9,000 is closer to your budget, but you might be able to get it down to $8,500 or even closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000. I'm still a little over budget, but I'm willing to pay $8,750.  It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  $8,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $8,900?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You're still closer to your goal with Alice. It's worth trying to get her down a bit further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I think we're getting close.  $8,900 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go to $8,800.  That's my final offer.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 8800}
