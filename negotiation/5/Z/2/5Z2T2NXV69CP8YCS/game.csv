"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $15000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $22500. This is my best price, but I think it's a fair compromise.",22500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $22500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $18000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",18000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $20000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $20000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $17500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",17500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $19500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",19500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $18500. This is my final concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",18500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still not comfortable with $18500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18500 and my previous offer of $17000, so I'm counteroffering at $17750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",17750.0,Bob,10,
