"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a good amount. I'm starting with a price of $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum because I have the option to sell to John for $150 if the negotiation doesn't work out. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is worth less than $150 to me. Would you consider lowering the price to $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is a decent amount, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I still have the option of selling to John for $150, so I'll see if I can get Bob to move closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand you're interested in the product but I'm not quite ready to go down to $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $157.50?  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 157.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and $145 is a bit too low for me right now. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $145 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - how about $150? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, would you consider $142 as a fair price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum, and I don't think I can get him to budge much higher.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $150, it makes more sense to sell to him and secure the higher price."
