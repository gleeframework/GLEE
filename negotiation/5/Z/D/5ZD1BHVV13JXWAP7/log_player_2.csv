"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price that's very attractive, given its value to you. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's discuss a price of $1000000. It's a significant savings for you, and it allows me to get a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm considering Alice's offer. Since the product is worth $800,000 to her, it's likely she's being generous with the offer. However, I'm looking to save as much money as possible. Since I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, I can afford to pay a bit more, but I'd like to save $200,000. Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still a good deal, but I'll try to negotiate further.
