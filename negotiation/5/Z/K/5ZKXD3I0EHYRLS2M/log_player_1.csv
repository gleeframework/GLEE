Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a higher price, Bob has been consistently moving upwards and is now at a respectable $1,200,000. It's unlikely he'll go much higher if his ""final offer"" statement is genuine. Accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
