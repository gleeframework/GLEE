Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. What do you think?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $130. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $127.50. Can you consider this price?",127.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to my minimum price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $129. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",129.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $129. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $128.50. Can you reconsider?",128.5,Bob,8,
