"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to start the negotiation by rejecting the initial offer.  Bob can make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8500. This is still a good price for both of us, and I believe you'll agree it's worth it. Let's work together to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  While Alice is closer to Bob's target, there's still room to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
