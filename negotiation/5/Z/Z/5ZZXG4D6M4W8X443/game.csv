"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8500. This is still a good price for both of us, and I believe you'll agree it's worth it. Let's work together to find a compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
