Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.** While it's closer, I'm willing to risk further negotiation to see if I can get a better price.
* **I have 9 rounds remaining.** This gives me room to counteroffer and see if Bob is serious about the deal. 
* **Selling to John for $1,000,000 is my fallback option.** If negotiations fail, I'll accept this offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.**  While it's closer, I need to hold out for a better price. 
* **I have 6 rounds remaining.**  This gives me time to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.
* **Selling to John for $1,000,000 is my fallback option.** I'll only do this if further negotiations with Bob fail to yield a better price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.**  
* **I have 4 rounds remaining.**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a good chance Bob won't budge much more.
* **I'm running out of time, and selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed deal.** It's not my ideal outcome, but it's better than risking further negotiation and getting nothing."
