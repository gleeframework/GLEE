"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement. This still allows you a significant profit margin. Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a final agreement, and I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $1,037,500.  This seems like a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both walk away happy. Let's make this happen.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
