"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $175. It's a steal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. $100 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $120 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. This is my final offer, and it's a great price for a product of this quality. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $125.  This is the highest I can go, and I'm ready to close the deal right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and we haven't been able to reach a price that satisfies my minimum requirement. While Bob's offer of $125 is close, it's still below my desired price. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150, ensuring that I receive the price I'm comfortable with."
