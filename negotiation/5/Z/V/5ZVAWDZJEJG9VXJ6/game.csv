"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm keen on the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle? ",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $750,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. While $750,000 is closer, I think a price closer to $700,000 would be more realistic. Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,
