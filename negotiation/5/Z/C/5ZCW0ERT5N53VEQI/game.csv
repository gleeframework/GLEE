"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects its value to me and leaves some room for both of us to come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your desired price. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",875000.0,Bob,4,
