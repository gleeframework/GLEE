"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your understanding of my constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's value while also being reasonable considering your budget.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're still trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000 is still too low for me, so I'll meet you in the middle of that and my minimum price of $1500000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1325000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1325000.0,Alice,5,,
