"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which I believe reflects its fair market value. I'm confident this price is reasonable for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price point reflects a more accurate valuation while still acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 remains above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  I'm eager to reach a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
