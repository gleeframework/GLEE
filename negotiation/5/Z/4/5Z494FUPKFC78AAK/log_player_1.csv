Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested,  $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer you $750000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and provides a fair margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  How about $800000? This price aligns more closely with my assessment of the product's value, and it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?
