"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. I'm asking for $12,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product and think it would be a great fit for me, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's unlikely he'll reach $10,000.  I have a guaranteed offer from John, and continuing to negotiate with Bob risks getting stuck below my minimum."
