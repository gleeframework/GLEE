"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really pushing the limits of my budget here.  Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both walk away happy.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're really close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a good compromise. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
