"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is still above his maximum budget. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. He should reject and try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're really close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, Bob should buy from John. Alice has come down to $9,750, which is still more than Bob wants to pay.  Buying from John at $8,000 is the best option to save money."
