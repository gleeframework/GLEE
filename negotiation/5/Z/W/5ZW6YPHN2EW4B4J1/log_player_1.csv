Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth $1,500,000 or even more in the right hands. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly above your minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the best possible outcome while having a safety net in place."
