"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds significant value for me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you. Considering its importance and the benefits it offers, I am extending an offer to sell it to you for $12,000. This price reflects its true worth while allowing us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of getting a better price, or simply sticking with your backup plan."
