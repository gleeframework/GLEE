"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties looking at the product, and I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to meet you at $9,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. I'll meet you at $9,500. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to go a bit higher.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think I've been too generous with my previous offers. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep negotiating.",9000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to pay $9,000 for the product. My budget is $8,000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'd like to buy the product from you, but I need you to meet me at my price. If not, I'll have to look elsewhere.",8000.0,Bob,8,
