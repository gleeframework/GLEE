"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to reflect your budget, but I can't go any lower. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I can see this product is valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm ready to meet you halfway.  How about $8,500? This would be a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's close this deal!",8500.0,Alice,5,
