"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
