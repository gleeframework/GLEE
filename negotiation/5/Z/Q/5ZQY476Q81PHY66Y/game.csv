"Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a truly unique product.  I'm asking $1800000 for it, a price I believe reflects its significant value.  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1800000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer,  $1400000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I can only offer $1500000. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1500000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to accept $1550000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal. ",1550000.0,Alice,5,
