"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? It's still a good deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $11,250? That's halfway between my last offer and yours, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
