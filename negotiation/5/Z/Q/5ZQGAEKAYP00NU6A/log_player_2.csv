"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $120, which is less than John's price of $150.
* **You're willing to pay up to $150:** Your maximum budget is $150, so Alice's offer fits within that. 

Therefore, it's advantageous to accept Alice's offer to save $30."
