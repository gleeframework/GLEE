Alice is moving closer to my price, but I'm still willing to see if I can get it lower. It's still better than John's price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to give you a bit more wiggle room, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $112.50. That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While I could try to haggle a tiny bit more, it's risky. Accepting at $112.50 gets me the product for a good price."
