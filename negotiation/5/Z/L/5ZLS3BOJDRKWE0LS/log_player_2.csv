"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's a $1,000 gap between your maximum price and Alice's offer. You can use that gap to your advantage during negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice $10,500. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's  $500 less than Alice's offer, which is a significant discount, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  It also reflects that you're serious about buying the product, but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, but it's still $200 higher than your last offer. It's worth continuing the negotiation, as there's still a $700 gap to bridge.  You can try another counteroffer to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer to $10,800. This is a compromise, acknowledging that Alice's offer is closer to my maximum price. However, it still leaves a $400 gap, giving us both room to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum price, but it's still $600 higher than my ideal price.  There's a risk that continuing to negotiate will only lead to further counteroffers that push the price higher. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $12,000, as it guarantees a purchase within my budget and avoids the potential for further negotiation that could end up costing me more."
