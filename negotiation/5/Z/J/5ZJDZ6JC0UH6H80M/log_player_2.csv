"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,000,000 is way above his budget.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

Bob should start by making a significant counteroffer.  $600,000 is a good starting point, giving Alice room to negotiate while still being well within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again keeps the negotiation moving towards a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

Bob should increase his counteroffer slightly. $700,000 is a reasonable price that is closer to Alice's last offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Alice's offer of $850,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a bit high. With more rounds to go, Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's still a chance he can get closer to his target price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob should now make his final offer at $800,000. This is his target price, and it's unlikely Alice will go lower. If she rejects, he can always buy from John."
