"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm open to further negotiations if this offer is not acceptable to you.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however,  $1,600,000 is still quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?  This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your initial offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make a revised counteroffer of $1,650,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm open to further negotiations if this offer is not acceptable to you.",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I recognize you're serious about this purchase.  My final offer is $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects the absolute lowest I can go.  Let me know your thoughts.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make a revised counteroffer of $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. If this offer is not acceptable to you, I may need to consider purchasing the product from John for $1,200,000.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
