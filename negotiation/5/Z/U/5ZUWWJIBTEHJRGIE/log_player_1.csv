**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob is firmly rooted at $1,600,000 and even threatening to go to a competitor (though his information about John is inaccurate).  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting his offer nets me a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of a stalemate."
