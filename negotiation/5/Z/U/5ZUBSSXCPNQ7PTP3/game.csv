"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it undervalues the product's unique features and long-term potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. I'm confident this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the high price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe the product's value is higher, I'm willing to accept $1,050,000  to close this deal quickly. This offer stands as a testament to my desire to work with you and my confidence in the value you'll gain from this purchase.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
