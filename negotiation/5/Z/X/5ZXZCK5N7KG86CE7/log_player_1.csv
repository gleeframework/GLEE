"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. After evaluating its value, I believe a fair price would be around $1,000,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both your minimum and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a significant gap from what I had in mind. This product offers a unique value proposition that justifies a higher price. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,800,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's perspective, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. Considering the current market and the product's characteristics, I propose a price of $1,300,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to John's offer, we're still in early rounds. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get closer to $1,500,000 before accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,550,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of this product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I appreciate your efforts in finding a middle ground. Based on my assessment, I am willing to offer $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for you. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to John's guaranteed price. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of losing both offers."
