Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  $12000 is a good starting point, but it's a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $13500 for the product. This gives us both a fair deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.
