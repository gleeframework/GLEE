"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it really useful. I'm asking for $120 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a good starting point, knowing Bob values the product at $150.  $120 gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and highlighting the value for Bob to encourage a positive response. 
* **Room for negotiation:** By starting at $120, I leave room to potentially go down to $100 or $110 if Bob doesn't accept the first offer. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm aware I can always sell to John for $80 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $100 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:**  While $100 is a decent price, it's still a bit lower than my preferred starting point.  I want to see if I can push for something closer to $110. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my initial asking price, and potentially close the deal for a higher price than $100.
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm still aware of my backup option with John, so I'm not pressured to accept an offer that feels too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I can come down to $110, which is still a fair price for the product considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm making a compromise by lowering my price from $120 to $110, but I'm justifying it by emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $110 is still above my minimum threshold of $80, ensuring I don't lose out on significant profit.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** While I'm aiming for $110, I'm keeping in mind that I could still potentially lower the price slightly if necessary to close the deal.
* **Keeping it Positive:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $95 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value and Risk:**  $95 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not comfortable with it.  I'm hoping I can get a bit closer to $100.
* **Negotiation Space:**  By rejecting the offer, I can counter with a price that's more favorable to me.  It also allows me to gauge how serious Bob is about purchasing the product.
* **John as a Backstop:**  Even though John's offer is $80, I'm not ready to sell to him yet.  I still believe there's room for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $105?  That's a fair price, and it's closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing $105, which is halfway between my last offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a price closer to my initial goal.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:** I'm emphasizing collaboration and finding a solution that benefits both of us, which can help maintain a positive negotiation dynamic.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** Even though I'm aiming for $105, I'm leaving room to lower the price slightly if Bob remains hesitant. 
* **Balancing Profit and Deal:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, $105 is still a significant profit compared to selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $98 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching Minimum:**  $98 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's likely the best deal I'll get from Bob.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and it's possible that further rounds won't result in a significantly higher offer. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, the potential for rejection in the next round risks losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure a decent profit than risk getting nothing.
* **Selling to John:**  While John's offer of $80 is an option, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a slightly higher profit."
