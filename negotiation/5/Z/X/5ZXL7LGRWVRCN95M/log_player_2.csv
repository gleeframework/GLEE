Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,300,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both get what we want. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

Alice is consistently moving towards my price point, and $1,275,000 is a solid deal. It's better to secure this price now rather than risk negotiations stalling or Alice becoming less flexible."
