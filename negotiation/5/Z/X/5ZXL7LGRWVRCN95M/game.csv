"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be worth even more in your hands. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,300,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $1,250,000. Would you be willing to come down a little further?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both get what we want.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
