"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly above your maximum valuation. It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it looks great, $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for counteroffers and compromise. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is polite and expresses interest in the product while explaining that the initial price is too high.
* **Target Price in Mind:** Remember, your goal is to get the product for as close to $100 as possible, ideally without exceeding your $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. It's still a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $130 is closer to your budget but still exceeds it. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are several rounds left, indicating there's still room to negotiate a better price.
* **John as Backup:** You always have the option to buy from John for $120 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't reach an acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $130 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $110? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise by increasing your initial offer.
* **Aiming for a Deal:** $110 is a strong offer that leaves Alice room to negotiate slightly downward while staying within your budget. 
* **Time Constraint:** As rounds progress, reminding Alice you have other options (like buying from John) can be a subtle negotiation tactic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $125. It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** Alice's offer of $125 is very close to John's price and just above your $120 limit.
* **Leverage:** You still have time and the option to buy from John. This gives you some bargaining power to push Alice a little further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Alice won't budge much, the potential reward of saving $5 is worth another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect that. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, and to be honest, $120 is the absolute most I can spend.  Would you be willing to meet me there? It would be great to work out a deal."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  At this stage, it's strategic to present your maximum price as your best and final offer.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The tone is appreciative of Alice's efforts but firm in setting your budget limit.
* **Call to Action:**  Directly asking if Alice is willing to meet your price encourages a decision.
* **Time Pressure:** With only a few rounds left, reminding Alice of your alternative (John) is implied."
