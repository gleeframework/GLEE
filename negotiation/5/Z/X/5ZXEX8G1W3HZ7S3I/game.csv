"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it looks great, $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. It's still a great deal for both of us!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $130 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $110? That feels like a fair compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $125. It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect that. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, and to be honest, $120 is the absolute most I can spend.  Would you be willing to meet me there? It would be great to work out a deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
