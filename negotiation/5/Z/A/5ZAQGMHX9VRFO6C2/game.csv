"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,600,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to me. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective.  While $1,600,000 represents a fair valuation given its potential, I understand your position. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
