Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" hinting at reasons why my price might be higher than Bob's initial assessment.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I want to appear flexible and willing to work with Bob, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation process. 
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage. If Bob's offers don't meet my expectations, I can walk away confidently."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,600,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to me. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value, which is expected. While I could accept John's offer and secure my minimum, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective.  While $1,600,000 represents a fair valuation given its potential, I understand your position. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:** I'm making a substantial drop from $1,600,000 to $1,350,000, signaling to Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is still comfortably above both Bob's offer ($1,000,000) and my absolute minimum ($1,200,000), leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's ""true value"" to reinforce that my price isn't arbitrary. 
* **Seeking Compromise:** By stating that I want to ""find a middle ground,"" I'm encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Anchoring:** Bob is sticking firmly to his initial offer of $1,000,000, a classic negotiation tactic called anchoring. This suggests he may not be willing to move significantly from this price point.
* **Limited Potential Upside:**  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely Bob will suddenly jump to a price closer to my $1,350,000 counteroffer. The potential gains from further negotiation are low.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's standing offer of $1,200,000 guarantees a profit above Bob's current offer and eliminates the risk of further stalemates. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and take the guaranteed win with John."
