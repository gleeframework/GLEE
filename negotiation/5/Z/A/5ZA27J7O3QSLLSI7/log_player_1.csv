{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's above my minimum but leaves room for Bob to counter. I'm confident the product is worth more than $11,500 to him, and I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I will counter with a price closer to my original offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and meet at $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $10,750? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and the risk of losing the deal altogether."
