"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly tone:** A positive message might encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $140 gives me room to make a few counteroffers if needed before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While closer to my minimum price, I can likely get more.
* **I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob.**  If I reject his offer, I can counteroffer and see if he's willing to go higher.
* **There are still rounds left.**  Selling to John is a safe option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested.  How about we split the difference at $135?  That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This shows good faith and willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $135 is still more than my minimum price of $150.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly to maintain a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my offer of $130.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is firm on $130:** He has rejected my previous counteroffer and is sticking to his price.
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 4, and each round brings me closer to needing to sell to John.
* **$130 is acceptable:** While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $150. 

It's better to secure a sale now than to risk losing the deal altogether and being forced to sell to John at $150."
