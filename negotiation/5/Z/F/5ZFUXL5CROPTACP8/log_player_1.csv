Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Bob's value but still allows you a decent profit. It leaves room for negotiation and hopefully starts a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. How about $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good deal, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $950,000?  This price still leaves you with a substantial profit and is a great opportunity for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $950,000. It's a good compromise, and the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer or even a rejection from Bob isn't worth it. It's time to close the deal and secure the profit."
