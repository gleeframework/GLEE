I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and my assessment of his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm countering with $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and  $12,500 is a good compromise.  I'm willing to accept this offer."
