Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer allows me to earn a significant profit ($4,000) while still offering Bob a good deal, as he'll still get $1,000 of value from the product. 

This price is likely to be attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $15,000. By offering a price close to his perceived value, I increase the chances of him accepting the offer. 

If he rejects, I can still sell to John for $10,000, ensuring a profit of $10,000."
