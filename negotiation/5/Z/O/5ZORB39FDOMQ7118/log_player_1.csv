Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible while ensuring we don't go below our minimum ($1,500,000). 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While we start high, the message implies a willingness to negotiate, which could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
 
**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, we have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000, ensuring we never sell below our minimum."
