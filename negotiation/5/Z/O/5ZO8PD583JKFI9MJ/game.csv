"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11000. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my maximum. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $10000. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll offer it to you for $10500. It's a slight increase, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value this product brings.",10500.0,Alice,5,
