"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1350000 is a fair price. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I still need to recoup my investment.  I'm willing to lower my price slightly, but I can't go any lower than $1300000.  This is a great opportunity for you and it's a fair price considering the potential of the product. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
