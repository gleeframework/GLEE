{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, giving Bob a good deal, but still leaves me with a substantial profit.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'm confident this initial offer will start the conversation well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value to me while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,150,000. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. My counteroffer is $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is close enough to my desired price point that it's worth accepting.  While I could potentially push for a higher price, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether. This price ensures a good profit for me, and I can move on to other opportunities."
