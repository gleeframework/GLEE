"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but $11,500 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
