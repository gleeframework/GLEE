# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $145 is lower than her value, it's still more than you want to pay. Buying from John at $120 ensures you get the product at your desired price."
