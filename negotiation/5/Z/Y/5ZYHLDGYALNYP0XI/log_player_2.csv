"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose specifics without a confidentiality agreement, I can assure you its worth is no less than $800000 to me. I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.  This is a limited-time offer, as another buyer is waiting in the wings.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Alice's offer. If I accept it, I'll be paying $1,000,000, which is $500,000 more than the minimum value Alice assigns to the product. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I don't know if it's worth more or less than $1,000,000. However, I do know that I can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is $300,000 more than Alice's offer. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John instead.
