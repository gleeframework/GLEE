Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125? It's getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $125, and John offers the product at $120.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
