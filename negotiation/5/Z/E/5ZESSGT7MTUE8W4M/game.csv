"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving towards my budget, Alice.  How about $110? That's a fair compromise in my mind.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125? It's getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
