"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, considering its value and the potential for a successful partnership.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer to what I had in mind, the product's unique value justifies a higher price point. I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end and positions us for a mutually beneficial deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
