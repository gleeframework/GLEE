Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I think it will be very valuable for you,  let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  While I could offer it for $15,000 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more, increasing the profit.
* **Reasonable markup:**  $14,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a somewhat fair deal. 
* **Urgency (subtle):** By mentioning its value to Bob specifically, it subtly implies this is a good opportunity he shouldn't miss.

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming to secure the highest possible price from Bob without pushing him directly to reject the offer."
