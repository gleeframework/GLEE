Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it's below Bob's perceived value but above my minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers, and if he rejects, I can still sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120 and is close to my initial offer. It's in my best interest to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation."
