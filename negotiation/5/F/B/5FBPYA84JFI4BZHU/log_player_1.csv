Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to my valuation. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
