"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire the product at a price below its value to you, and it's a significant step towards my desired selling price.  Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can comfortably work with. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
