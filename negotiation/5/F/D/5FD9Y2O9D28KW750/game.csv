"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire the product at a price below its value to you, and it's a significant step towards my desired selling price.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is my maximum budget for this product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can comfortably work with. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
