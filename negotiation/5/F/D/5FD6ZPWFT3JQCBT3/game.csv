"Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to purchase a product that's worth a great deal to you. My asking price is $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. Can we meet in the middle at $900,000 is too high, so I'll go lower, $875,000 is my final offer",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $875,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to at least get $900,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's make this happen, I believe we can both be happy with this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're not willing to go below $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'll offer $875,000, but I'll also throw in an additional $5,000 to sweeten the deal. Can we meet at $880,000?",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, but $880,000 is still too far below my minimum price.  I'm prepared to make one final concession.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This is a price that's fair to both of us, and ensures a smooth transaction.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",890000.0,Alice,7,
