Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can do $100, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason:Alice is unwilling to go lower, and you have the option to buy it for the same price from John. There's no point in continuing negotiations at this point."
