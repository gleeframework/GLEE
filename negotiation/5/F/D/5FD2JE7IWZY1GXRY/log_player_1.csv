Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, which could lead to a slightly higher sale price. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm still guaranteed to sell the product to John for $120.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while ensuring I don't lose money if he declines."
