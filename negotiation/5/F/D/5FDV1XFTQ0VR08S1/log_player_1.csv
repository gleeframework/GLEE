Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's value of $80, but below my minimum of $120. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but also allows me to potentially close the deal quickly if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $90. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.  I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest in the product.  I'm willing to go down to $95, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $85. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm confident that John will buy the product for $120, so I'll sell it to him."
