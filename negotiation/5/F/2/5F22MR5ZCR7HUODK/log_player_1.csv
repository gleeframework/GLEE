Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a price that is still significantly higher than its value to him, but it gives him room to negotiate and hopefully, we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If he rejects, I'm prepared to counter, but I also have John as a backup buyer at a price that is more than satisfactory to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm rejecting his offer and will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $10,000. This is still a good price for him, considering its worth to him is $8,000. It's also closer to my desired price point, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round."
