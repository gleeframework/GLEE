# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.

```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's initial offer is too high. It's still above the product's value to you ($1,200,000).

* Rejecting the offer allows you to start making counteroffers to see if you can get a better deal."
