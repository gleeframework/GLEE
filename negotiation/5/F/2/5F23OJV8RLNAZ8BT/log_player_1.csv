Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it gives us both room to make a profitable deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
