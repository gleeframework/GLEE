"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it gives us both room to make a profitable deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, I believe the product's value is closer to my initial asking price. To meet you somewhere in the middle, I'm willing to let it go for $1,110,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth.",1110000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,110,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000, which is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's aim for a win-win situation.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,095,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1095000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,095,000 is still outside my budget.  To make this work for me, I'd need to come in at $1,075,000. This offer is still a good profit for you and puts the deal within my range.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
