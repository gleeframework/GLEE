"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This represents a substantial investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,300,000 was my initial asking price, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this product, while also respecting my budget constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
