"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable piece, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price, but I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this time. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd need to see an offer closer to $850,000.  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's keep talking.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $850,000, but I'm still a bit far from that. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $775,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $812,500. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $812,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure I want to go that high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $785,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",785000.0,Bob,6,
