"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the potential value. This leaves room for negotiation while still making a good profit.  It's important to leave room for negotiation, but I don't want to undervalue the product too early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,000,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit.  This price is closer to Bob's offer while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer is very close to my target price and significantly better than selling to John.  There's a good chance Bob won't budge further, so I'm accepting his offer to secure the sale."
