Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim for a price higher than John's offer ($10,000) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is a starting point. Bob might counter, allowing for a potential agreement closer to your desired price.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob encourages him to consider the offer seriously."
