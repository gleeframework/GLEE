"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, recognizing the value you see in this product. This price allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $920,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $930,000?",930000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you coming closer to my price. I'm still a bit higher than $930,000. Would you be willing to consider $940,000? This would be a good compromise and allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. Remember, this product is worth a lot to you, and this price allows you to secure it at a very competitive rate.  Let's make this happen!",940000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to be closer to my target. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concern, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $935,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you and the fact that we are nearing the end of our negotiation. I'm confident this deal is mutually beneficial. What do you say?",935000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go above $925,000. I've made a serious offer, and I think it's a good compromise. I'm not budging on this one. Can you meet me at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,8,
