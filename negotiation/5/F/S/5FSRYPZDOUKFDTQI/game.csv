"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is far greater than your initial offer. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me while allowing you to make a profit.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up, but I need to see a more significant jump to make this worthwhile for both of us. How about $1,300,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a great deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value to me and gives us both a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
