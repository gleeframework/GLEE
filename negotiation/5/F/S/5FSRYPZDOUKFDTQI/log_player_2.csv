Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me while allowing you to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up, but I need to see a more significant jump to make this worthwhile for both of us. How about $1,300,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
