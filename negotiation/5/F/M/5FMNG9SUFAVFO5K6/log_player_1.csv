Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price close to your guaranteed sale price ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely to be from this higher point.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly reinforces the product's worth, justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" invites Bob to counter-offer, opening up the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room for a deal that's still very favorable to you, Alice."
