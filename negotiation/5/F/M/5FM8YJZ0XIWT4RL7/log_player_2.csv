"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that will surely impress. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. We'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product looks great, but I'm working with a tight budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down, aiming for a price that saves us $1,500 from Alice's initial offer and $2,000 from John's price. It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still looking for a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is willing to negotiate, which is a good sign. We're getting closer to a price that works for us, but there's still potential for saving more.  We'll counter-offer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between our last offer and her counteroffer.  It shows willingness to move towards her price while still aiming for significant savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,200. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly firm on staying above $11,000. This offer saves us $750 compared to John's price and is a reasonable compromise. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
