Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing his valuation is higher than John's.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Strong but Fair:** The message positions the price as ""fair"" based on the product's value, encouraging Bob to consider it seriously.

By offering the product at $1,100,000, Alice aims to:

1. **Secure a deal with Bob:** The price is attractive to Bob as it's still below his perceived value.
2. **Maximize her profit:**  Alice secures a $300,000 profit if Bob accepts (compared to $0 profit if she went directly to John).

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the best possible outcome for Alice."
