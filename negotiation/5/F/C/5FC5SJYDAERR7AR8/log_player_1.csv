Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about $95? That's a fair bit closer to your price, and I'm hoping we can find a good compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this. I understand $115 is your final offer, but that's still a bit high for me. I can do $100, which is the most I'm willing to spend.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's unlikely he'll go above $100. I'd rather take the guaranteed $120 from John."
