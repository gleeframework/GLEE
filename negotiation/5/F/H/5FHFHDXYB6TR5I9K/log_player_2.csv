"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it could really benefit you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the initial offer. $9,500 is too high, and there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring a counteroffer before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you proposing a price, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. This product is valuable to me, but I'm trying to stay within a specific budget.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $9,500 is already a very competitive price for this product and its value.  To move forward, I could meet you halfway at $9,000. This feels fair considering the benefits you'll gain. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than he wants to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I'm confident this price would be fair to both of us, allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $8,900.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While Bob would prefer a lower price, $8,900 is a good deal. It's within his budget and closer to Alice's minimum than his last offer.  Accepting allows Bob to avoid further negotiation and secures the product for a good price.  There's a good chance that further negotiation would only result in more rounds and potential for Alice to become less flexible."
