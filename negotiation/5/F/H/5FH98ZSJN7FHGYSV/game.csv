"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you have a budget in mind, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair, I can adjust my budget a bit, but $775,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like.  How about we settle at $725,000?  That would work well for me.",725000.0,Bob,6,
