{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a clear expectation that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $14000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is more than Bob's initial assessment, it is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13,250. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13250 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12750? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer of $12,750 is closer to my desired price, it is still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm confident that I can get my desired price from John, so I'm going to sell the product to him instead."
