"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This sets the tone for the negotiation and establishes my starting point.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while leaving room for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm aiming for a higher profit and am willing to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming for a profit that's closer to my initial desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can get a better deal through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but still aiming for a significant profit. This offer is closer to Bob's last offer and shows my willingness to compromise, while still maintaining a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, the negotiations with Bob are becoming increasingly difficult. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's not close enough for me to feel comfortable. With only 4 rounds left, there's a risk that I won't be able to get a better price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit and provides certainty."
