"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This product is worth $120 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate it.  However, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $130 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $165? It's a fantastic product, and I'm sure you'll get a lot of use out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $165 is still too high.  You can try to negotiate further.  It's always worth trying to get a better deal, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $165 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference - $142.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 142.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to get at least $150 for this product.  I could come down to $150, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $150 is still higher than your maximum budget. At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $120. You've already established that John is willing to sell it to you for your maximum price, and continuing to negotiate with Alice risks either reaching a stalemate or ending up paying more than you want."
