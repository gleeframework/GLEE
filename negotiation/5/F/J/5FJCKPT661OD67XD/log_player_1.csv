Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. $11,500 is significantly less than what I want for the product. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $11,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $12,250.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's worth closing the deal now rather than risking further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
