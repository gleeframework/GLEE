Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}

Bob is increasing his offer again, but only slightly. He's trying to find a middle ground between his target price and Alice's offer. $9,750 represents a compromise, and he hopes this will convince Alice to accept the deal. He's still hesitant to go much higher, knowing he can always buy from John for $8,000 if necessary."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still too high for Bob, but he's getting close to his limit.  He's only got a few rounds left. Rather than risk Alice further lowering the price or getting stuck with a price he's unhappy with, Bob chooses to buy the product from John at his target price of $8,000.  This guarantees him the best deal and avoids further negotiation."
