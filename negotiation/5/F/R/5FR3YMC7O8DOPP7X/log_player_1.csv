(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything less than what I consider the product to be worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still trying to get a good price."

Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum value and I'm running out of time. It's better to accept his offer than risk further negotiation and possibly lose the deal to John."
