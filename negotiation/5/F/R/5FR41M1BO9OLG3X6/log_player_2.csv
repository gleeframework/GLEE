Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $750,000. This is the best price I'm willing to offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $725,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'll meet you halfway between $700,000 and $750,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is getting closer to my ideal price. While I would prefer to pay less, I'm starting to feel the pressure to reach a deal before my 10 rounds are up. Buying from John would be more expensive, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. I'm going to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
