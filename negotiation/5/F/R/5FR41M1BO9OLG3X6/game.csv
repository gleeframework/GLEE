"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of the product, $800,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $750,000. This is the best price I'm willing to offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our positions. Let's see if we can close this deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $725,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'll meet you halfway between $700,000 and $750,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,5,
