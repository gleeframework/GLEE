"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  That still leaves you a good amount of profit, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",975000.0,Bob,4,
