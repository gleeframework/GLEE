"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $11,000. I know you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $11,000.  Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While $9,500 is tempting, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $10,500 is still below Bob's maximum price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price from her initial offer.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and potentially losing the deal altogether is high.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise that achieves Bob's goal of saving money."
