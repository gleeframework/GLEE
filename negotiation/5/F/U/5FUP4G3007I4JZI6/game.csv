"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, recognizing its value to both of us.  This price gives us a healthy margin for profit, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the significant value the product offers you and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's continue to work towards a final agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a profitable deal. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired margin.
