Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, recognizing its value to both of us.  This price gives us a healthy margin for profit, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I believe we can still get closer to my desired price range. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
