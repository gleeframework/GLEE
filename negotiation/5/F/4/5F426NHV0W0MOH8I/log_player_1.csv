Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $145. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit.
* **It's close to your minimum:** This allows you to potentially negotiate higher if Bob is willing to pay more.

It's important to remember that you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value of $150. It's worth exploring if we can reach a more acceptable price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm sure you'll still find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
