"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its market value and my intended use for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring you a significant return on your investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and reflects the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While $1,300,000 is still under what I hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price if you can assure me this is your absolute final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
