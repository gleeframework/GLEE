"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point. I'm willing to offer $9,500, recognizing the value you've placed on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product can bring you significant value exceeding the $9,500 mark.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,250 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,875.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a great deal.",9875.0,Bob,4,
