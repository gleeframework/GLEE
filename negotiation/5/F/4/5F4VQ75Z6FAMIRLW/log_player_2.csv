Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product can bring you significant value exceeding the $9,500 mark.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.
