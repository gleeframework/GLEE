"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $130?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate!  $130 is still a little lower than I'm comfortable with, though. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me.  $135 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's meet in the middle again, at $132.50.  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",132.5,Bob,4,
