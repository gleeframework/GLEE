"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While we want to get the best price possible, we also don't want to scare him off. Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $950,000?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

We've come down significantly from our initial offer, but we're still aiming high. This leaves room for further negotiation while staying well above Bob's initial offer and our safety net with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is still a little steep for me.  Could we settle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're getting closer, but $700,000 is still below our minimum and John's offer. We need to nudge Bob a bit higher while showing we're willing to make a deal.  Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a way for us to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This feels like a fair price considering its value."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

We're now getting very close to both our desired price and Bob's upper range. This offer represents a significant compromise from our initial ask while still aiming for a price well above our safety net with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're invested in finding a fair deal. Would you consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is getting closer to our minimum, we're still leaving money on the table compared to John's offer. Let's push a little further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To show you I'm serious about getting this done, let's make it $825,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering the product's value."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

We're now just above John's offer and only a small concession away from our previous offer. This makes it clear we're aiming for a price in this range while still allowing Bob to counter if he's determined to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. How about we split the difference and make it $800,000? This would be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob has met our minimum acceptable price and matched John's offer. There's no point in risking further negotiation for a potentially small gain. Accepting this offer secures a good deal for us."
