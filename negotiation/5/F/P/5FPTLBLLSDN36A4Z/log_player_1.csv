"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  Since Bob values the product at $80, there's room for negotiation, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a bit more.  I'm also using a friendly tone in my message to encourage a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $100.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a good offer, I need to be closer to $100 to make this deal work.  How about $95?  It's a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm sticking to my goal of getting as close to $100 as possible, but I'm also being flexible and willing to compromise.  Offering $95 shows that I'm willing to negotiate, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $85 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with the deal.  I'm hoping that by continuing the negotiation, I can convince Bob to offer a higher price or else, I'll sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a little further, but I need to be at $92 to make this deal work. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92} 
```

I'm making a slightly smaller reduction this time, hoping that Bob will start seeing that we're getting close to an agreement. I'm emphasizing that I want to find a solution that benefits both of us, to make him feel like we're working together towards a common goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $92 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $87 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with the deal.  I'm hoping that by continuing the negotiation, I can convince Bob to offer a higher price or else, I'll sell the product to John.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87 is still a bit below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $90 as a final offer.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still offering you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm pushing for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm also acknowledging Bob's efforts to meet me halfway. This time, I'm calling it my ""final offer,"" hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still willing to make a compromise. Would you be willing to meet me at $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100.  While I would have preferred to get a higher price from Bob, it seems like we've hit an impasse, and we're only two rounds away from the end of the negotiation.  Selling to John ensures that I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of accepting a price that is too low for me."
