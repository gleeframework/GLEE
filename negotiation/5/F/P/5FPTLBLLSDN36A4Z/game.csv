"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a good offer, I need to be closer to $100 to make this deal work.  How about $95?  It's a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a little further, but I need to be at $92 to make this deal work. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $92 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $87?",87.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87 is still a bit below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $90 as a final offer.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still offering you a great deal on a valuable product.",90.0,Alice,7,
