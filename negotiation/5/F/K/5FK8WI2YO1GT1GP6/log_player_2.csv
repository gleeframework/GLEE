The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $120. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

While $100 is closer to my $80 maximum, I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  It's worth a few more rounds to see if I can get closer."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is now $90, which is still a bit more than my maximum of $80. However, it's likely that she won't go lower, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing or having to buy from John at $80."
