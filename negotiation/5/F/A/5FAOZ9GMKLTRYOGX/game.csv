"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $13,000 to start. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet halfway between our two offers at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
