"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, however,  $950,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $700,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. However, $825,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we settle around $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $825,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $750,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
