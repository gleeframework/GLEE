Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This creates room for negotiation and leaves me some room to lower the price if necessary. It's important to be polite and express confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $8,500? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. I'm keeping the tone friendly and emphasizing the value of the product. My goal is to inch closer to my desired price point while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

I'm still holding out for a better price. Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $8,000, which is my minimum price and also the price John is willing to pay. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and hoping to close the deal this round."
