"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $8,500? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest one. How about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $8,000. It's a fair price for the value I'm offering.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round.",8000.0,Alice,5,
