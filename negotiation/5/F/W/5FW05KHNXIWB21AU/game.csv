,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $105?  I think this is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $110 is my final offer.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still a little high for me.  How about $108? I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. ",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $108 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $109 is my final offer. I believe this is a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product at a great price and me to earn a fair amount.  Let me know what you think.",109.0,Alice,5,
