Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $105?  I think this is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price.  $105 is too close to my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a higher price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $110 is my final offer.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still a little high for me.  How about $108? I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  $108 is still too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price with more negotiation.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I think I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $108 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $109 is my final offer. I believe this is a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product at a great price and me to earn a fair amount.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 109}
