"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is a decent price and within your budget, there's a chance you could get the product for a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for potential negotiation or sticking with your backup option (John)."
