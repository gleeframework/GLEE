Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price.  This ensures that I'm getting the value I need. Since John is offering me my minimum, there's no pressure to settle for less.  If Bob rejects, we can negotiate, but I'm willing to walk away at any time and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground. If not, I'll stick with my plan to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on getting a significant portion of my desired value. This counteroffer is a middle ground, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.  While it's still below my minimum, it's a good deal considering I could sell to John for $1,200,000. This is a good compromise and I'm willing to accept it."
