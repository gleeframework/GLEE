{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting very close to John's price, but it's still worth a final push to see if we can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I want to be fair.  How about we make it $120, my final offer. That's a good price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* We're in the late stages of negotiation. A firm but fair final offer can be effective.
* $120 is Alice's value for the product, so she is likely to accept, though there's a chance she might hold out for a slightly higher price. 
* If she rejects this, we're very close to John's price, and the potential savings might not be worth the risk of continued negotiation."
