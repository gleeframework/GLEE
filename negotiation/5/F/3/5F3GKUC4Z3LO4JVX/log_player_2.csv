Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true market value and potential for generating value for you. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's unique benefits and my desire to find a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've given this offer serious thought, and to be completely transparent, I can't accept anything less than $1,600,000. That's my bottom line to make this work. I believe this offer represents significant value for you, given your initial interest and the product's potential. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,600,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, there's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice. You'll save a significant amount of money by going with John."
