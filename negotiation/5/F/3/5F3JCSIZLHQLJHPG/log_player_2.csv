Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1050000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which still gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial solution.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1075000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1087500.  This is a fair offer, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's settle this and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
