Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering its worth $10,000 to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down on her price, she's unlikely to go below $11,000, especially if she's stated $11,250 is her final offer. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, guaranteeing the best possible price and saving you at least $1,250."
