"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering its worth $10,000 to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle somewhere around $10,000? It's a win-win for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
