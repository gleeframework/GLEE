Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal and I believe you'll find it incredibly valuable."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so that's your absolute floor. You'll only sell to Bob if he offers more.
* **Starting high:** By starting at $19,000, you're aiming for the highest possible profit margin.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate a price that's still very beneficial for you. 

**Important:** This is just an opening move. Be prepared to potentially lower your asking price slightly if Bob counters, but always stay above your $15,000 safety net."
