Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to stretch, Bob, but $11,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $13,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Alice seems pretty firm on a price well above your target. It's unlikely you'll negotiate her down to a price that saves you significantly over John's offer.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed price."
