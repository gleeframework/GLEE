"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your value, Alice.  While $12,500 is still a bit much for me, I could possibly stretch to $11,000.  Would that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your willingness to stretch, Bob, but $11,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,,
