"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,400,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
