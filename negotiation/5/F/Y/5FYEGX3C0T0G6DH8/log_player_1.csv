{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it allows room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I believe I can do better.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. It's a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for profit.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $17,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price point. I'm going to accept it."
