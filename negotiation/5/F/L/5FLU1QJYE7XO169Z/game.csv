"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,200,000. It's a steal for its value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go down to $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  That would still be a significant gain for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $950,000 is still too low. I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay the same amount.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
