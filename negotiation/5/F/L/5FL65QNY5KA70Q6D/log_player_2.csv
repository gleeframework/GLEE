"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  While I can't disclose the exact nature of it just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.  This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find it to be a profitable one.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While she claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, that's not relevant to your decision.  You have a guaranteed alternative with John for $1,000,000, making Alice's offer unacceptable."
