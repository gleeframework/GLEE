This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $210,000 less than John's price and $10,000 less than Alice's previous offer.
* **Time:** You've been negotiating for a while, and there's no guarantee you'll get a significantly better offer from Alice in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to push Alice down further might backfire, and she could hold firm. Accepting now secures the deal at a very reasonable price."
