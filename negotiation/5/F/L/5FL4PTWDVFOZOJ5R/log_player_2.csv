{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You can definitely get a better price than $1,200,000.  Since the product is only worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than what the product is worth to her.  This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  It's likely Alice will counter back, but you've already saved a significant amount of money by rejecting her initial offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer, but there's still room to negotiate. Rejecting her offer allows you to continue bargaining and potentially get a lower price. You're still saving a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering a price that is higher than your initial counteroffer.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she will continue to increase the price or you'll spend too much time haggling.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $1,500,000.  This ensures you get the product while still staying within your budget."
