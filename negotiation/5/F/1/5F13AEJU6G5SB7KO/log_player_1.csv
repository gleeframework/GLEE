Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your item's value, but I'd like to propose a lower price of $110. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $110 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $120?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet at $115? I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While getting a higher price would be ideal, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $115 secures a profit above the fallback offer from John."
