"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This price reflects the value and potential this product holds for your business.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but $1,500,000 is still out of my budget.  To be frank, I'm prepared to walk away if we can't find a price closer to $700,000. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. While $750,000 is closer to the mark, I need to see a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you consider $1,250,000? This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and demonstrates my desire to make this deal work.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,250,000 is still too far from what I had in mind. To be completely transparent, my budget tops out at $800,000. If you're willing to work within that range, I think we can close this deal. How about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
