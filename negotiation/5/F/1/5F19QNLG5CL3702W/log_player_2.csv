"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It's highly likely you can negotiate a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. Would you consider $600,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $600,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a good starting point to gauge her flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, you set an anchor that might influence Alice to counter with a more reasonable number than if you started closer to her initial offer. 
* **Leaving Room:** This offer leaves ample room for negotiation to take place over the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This price reflects the value and potential this product holds for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than your $800,000 maximum. It seems like she's moving in the right direction, but there's still room for negotiation. You have plenty of rounds left, so it's worth continuing the bargaining process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but $1,500,000 is still out of my budget.  To be frank, I'm prepared to walk away if we can't find a price closer to $700,000. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing the Offer:** Showing willingness to move closer to Alice's price demonstrates seriousness and encourages her to do the same.
* **Setting a Limit:** Mentioning $700,000 as a potential deal-breaker gives Alice a clearer idea of your acceptable range.
* **Compromise:**  Proposing $750,000  positions the offer as a fair compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. While $750,000 is closer to the mark, I need to see a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you consider $1,250,000? This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and demonstrates my desire to make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made another reduction, but it's still a long way from your $800,000 limit.  It's clear that she's trying to get a price well above what you're willing to pay. You can afford to hold your ground for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,250,000 is still too far from what I had in mind. To be completely transparent, my budget tops out at $800,000. If you're willing to work within that range, I think we can close this deal. How about $775,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Revealing Your Limit:** By now, it's strategically advantageous to reveal your maximum budget of $800,000. This shows Alice you're serious and sets a clear boundary.
* **Small Increase:**  Offering a slight increase to $775,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise, but only slightly, given you've now revealed your maximum.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes a desire to close the deal, encouraging Alice to make a decision quickly rather than dragging out the negotiation."
