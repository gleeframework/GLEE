"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $16500?",16500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think it's worth a bit more than $16500. How about we try $17000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $16000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $16250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",16250.0,Alice,5,
