"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I understand your concerns, but $700,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I understand your persistence, but $750,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
