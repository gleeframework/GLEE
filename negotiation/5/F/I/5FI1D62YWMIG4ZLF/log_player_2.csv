"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you have a better alternative. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her.  There's no guarantee she'll go lower, but it's worth a shot since John provides a fallback option."
