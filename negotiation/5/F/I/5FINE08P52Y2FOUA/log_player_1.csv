Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, there's no incentive to offer a lower price to Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at your desired price allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Direct Approach:**  The message is clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary fluff that might weaken your position. 

While Bob might reject this offer, it's the best strategy to maximize your potential earnings."
