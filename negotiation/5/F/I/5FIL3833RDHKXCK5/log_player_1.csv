"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's a high price, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects it. This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and understand his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better deal. There are 8 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $11,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but it still represents a significant profit for me. It also shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I have 6 rounds left, and I don't want to rush into a deal that leaves money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500.  This is a smaller decrease from my previous offer, showing Bob I'm firm on my price but still open to compromise.  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, so I'm putting pressure on him to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting close to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I have 4 rounds left, and I'm not going to rush into a deal unless it's truly a good one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,000. This is a strong final offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept, and I'm also increasing the risk for him to reject. If he rejects, he risks losing the opportunity to buy the product altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a difficult decision. I'm only $200 above my minimum price, and I'm worried that Bob might reject my next counteroffer and I'll end up selling to John for $8,000. It's risky, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's the best deal I've gotten so far, and it secures a sale with only two rounds left."
