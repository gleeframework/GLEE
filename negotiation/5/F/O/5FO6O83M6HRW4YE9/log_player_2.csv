"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $100 by myself. Considering its worth to you is $80, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. I am proposing to sell it to you for $95. This way, you save $5 compared to its perceived value, and I earn more than its actual cost to me. Let me know if this offer suits you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.
