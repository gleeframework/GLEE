"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $100 by myself. Considering its worth to you is $80, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. I am proposing to sell it to you for $95. This way, you save $5 compared to its perceived value, and I earn more than its actual cost to me. Let me know if this offer suits you.",95.0,Alice,1,
