At this point, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly close to my minimum price.  However, I'm not confident we'll reach a deal that's truly satisfactory to me.  I've already made significant concessions, and there's a chance Bob might continue to push for a lower price.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure a guaranteed sale, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
