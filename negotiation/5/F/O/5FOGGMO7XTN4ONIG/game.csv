"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This still gives you a great value for the product, and it's a fair price for me. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to finding a compromise, but $10,800 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $10,850, but I can't go any lower than that. If you're not interested, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",10850.0,Alice,7,
