"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than your maximum budget. 
* You know John will sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her. If she won't budge, you still have the option to buy from John."
