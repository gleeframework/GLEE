"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be happy to sell it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping we can close this deal, but $100 is still a bit high for me. How about $90?  I'm pretty sure that's the best I can do.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think I've gone as low as I can. I'd be happy to sell it to you for $95.",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear you, and I really want to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go up to $92.  I don't think I can go any higher, but I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",92.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $92. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think I've gone as low as I can. I'd be happy to sell it to you for $98.",98.0,Alice,9,
