{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is advantageous to me. It is higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I also frame the offer as a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to accept without too much pushback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I am confident I can get a better price by continuing negotiations.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $9,500? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm choosing to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise that is still above my minimum acceptable price, but allows for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to him again to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price. While I could potentially continue to negotiate, I risk him walking away completely, especially as he has already rejected multiple offers.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, which is my priority."
