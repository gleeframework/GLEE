"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $9,500? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
