Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $11,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while still exceeding her minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing Alice closer to her ideal profit. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning that the product will be listed publicly implies that Bob could miss out if he doesn't act quickly.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of securing a higher sale price than John's guaranteed offer."
