{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always worth trying to negotiate further before committing to a price.  $6,500 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for improvement."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This price is significantly lower than her initial offer, but still within a reasonable range for me.  We'll see if she's willing to meet me halfway."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice keeps increasing the price, but it's still far lower than John's price.  I'll continue negotiating.  I'm willing to go up a bit more, but not to the point where I'm close to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

I'm increasing my offer again, but still keeping it below $7,000. I'm getting closer to Alice's price, but still have room to negotiate. I'm hoping she'll realize that I'm a serious buyer, but not willing to overpay."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, but I'm not giving in yet.  I'm still committed to getting a better deal.  I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I need to see if she's willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

I'm increasing my offer one last time to show I'm serious about closing a deal, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price I'm comfortable with. I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm willing to meet her halfway. If she rejects this offer, I'm prepared to go to John."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting too close to my maximum budget.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John.  Even though I haven't gotten the absolute lowest price, I'm still saving a significant amount of money compared to John's initial price."
