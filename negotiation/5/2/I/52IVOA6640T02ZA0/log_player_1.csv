Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high. Bob's valuation matching yours doesn't mean he won't pay more, especially if he perceives a unique advantage.
* **Justification for the price:** The message doesn't just throw out a number. It hints at the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to pique Bob's interest and justify the high price.
* **Open for negotiation:**  The tone is polite and invites Bob's response. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market information:** This strategy assumes you don't have deep insights into the market beyond Bob's valuation. If you knew the product's demand was extremely high, you might push even further.
* **Bob's personality:**  If you knew Bob was extremely price-sensitive, a softer opening might be better. 

This offer aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging you have a fallback option with John."
