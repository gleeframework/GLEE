"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and there's room for me to potentially get a better price. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to secure a better price for this product. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $800,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am also looking for a good deal. This gives us a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $900000 to reflect the value of this product.  It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe this price point is still very competitive. Let's keep talking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is closer to my maximum budget, there's still room for further negotiation. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get her to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe in the value of the product, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This feels like a fair price considering our previous offers."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my strategy of trying to find a middle ground. By offering $850,000, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. Hopefully, this will encourage her to come down a bit further."
