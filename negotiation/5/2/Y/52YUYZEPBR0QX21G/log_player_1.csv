"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a high price to give me room to negotiate.  I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so this leaves a significant margin. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This initial offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget without committing to a final price. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I want to highlight the potential value of the product for Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to secure a better price for this product. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum threshold:**  While Bob's offer meets my minimum threshold of $800,000, I believe I can do better. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob's initial offer indicates he sees value in the product, opening the door for further negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees $800,000. However, continuing the negotiation with Bob has the potential to achieve a higher price. The risk of a failed negotiation is outweighed by the potential reward of a higher sale price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $900,000 to reflect the value of this product.  It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe this price point is still very competitive. Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my initial price but still aiming for a profit higher than my minimum.
* **Value emphasis:**  I reiterate the product's unique value to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  I state that I'm willing to continue negotiating, demonstrating a willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe in the value of the product, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This feels like a fair price considering our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 away from my initial target of $900,000. This is a significant gain compared to selling to John. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting this offer allows me to keep the negotiation open and potentially achieve a higher price in future rounds. 
* **Time constraint:** We are already in round 4, leaving only 6 rounds to close a deal. Accepting this offer provides certainty and limits the risk of losing the sale.

**Strategic consideration:** 

* By accepting Bob's offer, I can gauge his willingness to increase his offer in future rounds. This will inform my strategy for the remaining negotiation. 
* Accepting the offer also signals to Bob that I'm serious about selling, which may encourage him to be more flexible in the future."
