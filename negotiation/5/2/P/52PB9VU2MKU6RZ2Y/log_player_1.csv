Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd be happy to pay $12000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer is equal to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option 1.
