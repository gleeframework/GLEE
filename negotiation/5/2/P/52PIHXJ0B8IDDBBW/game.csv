"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 is below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? It's a win-win.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's compromise at $1,250,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
