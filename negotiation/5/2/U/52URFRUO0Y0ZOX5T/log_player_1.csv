"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value is $15000 to you, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  I still have 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a significant discount from my true value. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10250. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I'm hopeful I can get a price closer to $11,000 or higher.  I still have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can achieve a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,375. This price recognizes the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident this is the best possible outcome for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10375} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10375 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10200, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle and make a deal work. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, it's still not enough. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have a backup offer from John for $15,000. I'll continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to $10,500 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,200, but I'm still not satisfied with that price.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $10,300. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a deal that benefits both of us.  Let's reach an agreement and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10300} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $10300 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10250, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle and make a deal work. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not meeting my minimum goal. We're down to the last two rounds, and I don't have much room to negotiate. I'm also concerned that Bob might not be willing to budge further.  Therefore, it's more beneficial to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
