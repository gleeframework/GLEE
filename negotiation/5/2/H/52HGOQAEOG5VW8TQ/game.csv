"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true market value. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider it?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920000. Can you consider it?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $920000 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to go down to $935000 as a final compromise. This is a great price for a product of this quality.  Let's close this deal.",935000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we might not be able to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $935000.  It's a great price for a top-quality product. If you aren't willing to meet me there, I'll need to look elsewhere.",935000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go above $915000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925000. Can you consider it?",925000.0,Bob,8,
