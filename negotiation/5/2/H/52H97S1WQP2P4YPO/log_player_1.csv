"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to his perceived value, it's still too far below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000, and I believe there's still room for negotiation."

I'm going to counter with $10,000. I've lowered my price a bit more, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum value. I believe this price is fair, given the value of the product to both of us."
