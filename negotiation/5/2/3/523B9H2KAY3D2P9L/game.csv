"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. Can we discuss the details?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to look elsewhere.",85.0,Bob,4,
