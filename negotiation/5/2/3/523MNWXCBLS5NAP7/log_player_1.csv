Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems great, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, which is still a good value for both of us. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
