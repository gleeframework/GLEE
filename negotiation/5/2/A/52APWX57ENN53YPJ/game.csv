,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your perspective on the price.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $140? It's still a fair price for the quality of this product, and it reflects the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? I'm really interested in the product, and I think it's worth the investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
