"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $12,500 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  That's a significant discount, and it still leaves room for you to get a great deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. If we can meet in the middle, we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're very close to your target price of $12,000, and there are still several rounds left. Rejecting Alice's offer and counteroffering again will likely get you a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $13,100?  That's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  How about we meet at $13,150?  That's only $50 away from your offer and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let's close this deal, I'm sure you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You're very close to your target price, but Alice is now only willing to drop $50. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, you only have 3 rounds left.  It's more likely that you'll end up paying more than $12,000 if you continue.  Buying from John at $12,000 guarantees you get the product at your target price."
