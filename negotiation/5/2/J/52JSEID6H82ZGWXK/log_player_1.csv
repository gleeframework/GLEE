``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a rapport with Bob.
* **Value proposition:** I highlight the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open ended question:** I leave the decision open ended to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $12,500 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $12,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I have 9 rounds left and can try to push for a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing John will pay $15,000 gives me leverage to hold out for a higher offer from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  That's a significant discount, and it still leaves room for you to get a great deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:**  My counteroffer of $13,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's offer, but still offers a potential discount for him.

* **Open-ended question:**  I encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is exactly halfway between my last offer of $13,500 and Bob's offer of $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:** While Bob's offer of $13,100 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.
* **Potential for a better deal:** With 4 rounds left, there's still room for negotiation and potential for Bob to increase his offer.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:**  This offer is a small compromise from my previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still being close to my minimum.
* **Emphasis on the deal:** I reiterate the potential for a good deal for Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept.
* **Urgency:** I mention closing the deal, hinting at the possibility of moving on to another buyer if he doesn't accept.
* **Keeping John as a safety net:** I'm still willing to sell to John for $15,000, so this offer doesn't jeopardize that option."
