Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a great value considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That's still a significant savings for you and gets me closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8,750. How about we try $8,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  I've already reached my minimum threshold, and it's not worth risking losing the deal by trying to get a higher price. I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
