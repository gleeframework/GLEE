"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000.  It's still a great price for you, and it gives me a little more wiggle room.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,
