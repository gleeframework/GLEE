"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference at $1,125,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it'll let us move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,100,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. I hope this proposal works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue the discussion. While I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still not quite where I need to be. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price a bit further to $1,115,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",1115000.0,Alice,5,
