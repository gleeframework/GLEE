"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her minimum acceptable value, giving you room to negotiate. It's also significantly less than your maximum budget, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial deal.  

Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price that gives you a good profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget constraints, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $850,000 is still a good deal for me, considering my budget of $1,500,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a decent price without taking unnecessary risks."
