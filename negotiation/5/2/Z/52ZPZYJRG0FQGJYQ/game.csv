"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price that gives you a good profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget constraints, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
