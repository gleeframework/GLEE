"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good product Alice, but $16,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable going as low as $14,000. I'm willing to compromise at $17,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
