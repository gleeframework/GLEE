I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profits. I've chosen $1,500,000 as a starting point, leaving room for negotiation if necessary.  I'll be closely watching Bob's response and adjusting my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I want to try to get a little more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my ideal price. I'll accept it and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
