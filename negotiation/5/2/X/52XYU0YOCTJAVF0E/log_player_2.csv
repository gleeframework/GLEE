(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $180. This is significantly more than Bob is willing to pay.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to buy the product for his maximum value of $100.  This is a bold counteroffer, but it establishes Bob's limit and sets the stage for negotiation."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $160 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum value.  He should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal. There's still room for compromise, and Bob has the option of buying from John as a safety net."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $140 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit too high. Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and has a reliable backup option with John. There's still room for Alice to come down further, and rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing he's willing to compromise.  $130 is a reasonable midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's last offer.  He's demonstrating flexibility while still trying to get a better price.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is getting very close to Bob's desired price.  While it's still $35 above his ideal value, it's worth considering since there are only a few rounds left.  This is especially true given that Bob can always buy the product from John for $100 as a fallback.  Accepting this offer is a reasonable compromise to get the product without risking going too many rounds and potentially missing out."
