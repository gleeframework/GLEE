"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,200,000 is more than he's willing to pay. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay, and he can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  It's worth trying to get it down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident that this product is worth it to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's tempting to accept, he can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  He's already very close to his budget limit, but there's still room for a small concession from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $980,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $970,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 970000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can meet you at $975,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's limit:** While $975,000 is a good price, it's still very close to Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If Bob rejects Alice's offer and tries to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will either walk away from the deal or raise her price.  
* **John offers a guaranteed price:**  John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which is a known and guaranteed price.  There's no risk of further negotiation or a potential price increase.

It's important for Bob to weigh the slight price difference against the risk and uncertainty of continuing negotiations with Alice.  Choosing John guarantees a deal within his budget without any further potential complications."
