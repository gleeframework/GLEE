,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a good compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident that this product is worth it to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $980,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $970,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",970000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can meet you at $975,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",975000.0,Alice,7,
