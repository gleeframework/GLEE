"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs. To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This price is fair, considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1375000.0,Alice,7,
