"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This would ensure a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
