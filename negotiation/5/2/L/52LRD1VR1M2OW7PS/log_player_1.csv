{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to me, but I'm open to discussing it further. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my floor, I believe the product is worth more and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,000 to make this deal work. This still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
