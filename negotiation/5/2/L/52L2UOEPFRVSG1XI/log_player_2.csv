"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I understand it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset at a price that's still favorable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd save $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **You're still getting a good deal.** Even at $1,100,000, you're getting the product for less than what it's worth to you."
