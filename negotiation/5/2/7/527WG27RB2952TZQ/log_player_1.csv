Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. Offering the product at $14,000 gives her a $2,000 profit, which is the maximum she can achieve before Bob might reject the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $15,000 gives Alice room to negotiate above her minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering it at a price closer to $15,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. By proposing $14,000, Alice aims for a price appealing to Bob while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Backup Option:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, ensuring she doesn't lose money if Bob declines.

This strategy balances profit maximization with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
