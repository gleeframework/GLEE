"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",115.0,Bob,4,
