"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $135 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $110, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my target value through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $115 is getting closer to my minimum price, I believe I can get a better deal.  I'm still confident I can get closer to my goal of $120 through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $120? That's my minimum price, and it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
