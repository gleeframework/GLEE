**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's price of $1,200,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You're still saving money:** Even though Alice's price is higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000), it's still within your budget of $1,500,000 and allows you to save $300,000."
