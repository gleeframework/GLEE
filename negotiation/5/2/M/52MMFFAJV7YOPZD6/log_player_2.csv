{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product as close to his $150 limit as possible, but he wants to start with a price that still feels reasonable to Alice. A $15 drop from $85 is a reasonable starting point, and hopefully, Alice will see the value in closing the deal quickly."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $83.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $83
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 3 rounds left, the negotiation is not progressing quickly. Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price and is getting closer to his maximum budget.  To avoid risking a higher price or running out of time, Bob decides to buy from John for $150. This ensures he gets the product within his budget, and he doesn't have to risk a higher price with Alice in the remaining rounds."
