You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is unlikely to go above $115.  While we could try to negotiate further, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $120. It's better to take the sure thing and maximize our profit."
