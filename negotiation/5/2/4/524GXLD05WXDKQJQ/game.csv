"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This reflects a fair price based on my evaluation of the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
