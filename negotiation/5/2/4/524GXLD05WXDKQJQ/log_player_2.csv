"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our product to you. It's an exceptional opportunity that we believe could greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the impact it can have, we're offering it to you at a special introductory price of $1,200,000. We're confident this is a fair and attractive offer that respects both the value of the product and your potential gains. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still too high. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There are still nine rounds remaining, giving me ample time to try and reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This reflects a fair price based on my evaluation of the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, we've decided to adjust our offer slightly to accommodate your budget while still maintaining a fair valuation for our product. We are now offering the product at $1,000,000. We believe this price reflects the value of the product and remains competitive within the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than my desired price.  While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, it's not yet in the range I am comfortable with.  I'm hoping to get the price down to closer to my initial counteroffer of $900,000.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice and see if I can get a better deal.  I have plenty of rounds left to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still interested in this product but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $950,000? This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and shows my commitment to finding a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We appreciate your commitment, Bob. In light of our ongoing discussion, we've decided to offer the product at $975,000. This price reflects a balance between respecting the value of the product and accommodating your budget. We hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $975,000, which is very close to my counteroffer of $950,000. It's also significantly lower than the original price of $1,200,000, and far below the $1,500,000 I would pay to John. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price while avoiding further negotiation and potential risk of the deal falling through."
