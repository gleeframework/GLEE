Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

# Alice's message: I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1300000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to stay within my financial limits. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  This counteroffer is a smaller jump from your previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still being within your desired range.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not convinced that it's a fair price for the product. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $1200000, but I need you to commit to the purchase. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer, and I expect a serious commitment from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant improvement from her previous offer and is within your acceptable range.  While you could continue negotiating,  Alice's message suggests she's firm on this price, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal. 

* **Avoid potential deadlock:**  Rejecting this offer could lead to a stalemate, potentially forcing you to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Time pressure:**  You've already gone through several rounds, and the clock is ticking.  Accepting this offer secures the product for a good price while minimizing the risk of losing it altogether."
