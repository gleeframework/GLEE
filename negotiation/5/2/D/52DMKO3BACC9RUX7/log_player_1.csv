"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product at $1,150,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,125,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm sticking to my goal of maximizing my earnings.  I'm proposing a compromise price that is still advantageous to me while staying within the bounds of what Bob seems willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. Would you consider $1,075,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still determined to get a better price. I'm confident that I can negotiate further with Bob and reach a more favorable deal. The offer of $1,075,000 is too far below my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  This product is truly valuable, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob, although the risk of losing the deal to him is increasing.  I will try one more counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, but this is my final offer. I believe this price is still fair, given the value of the product. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
``` 
This is my final counteroffer. It's a compromise, but it's still a good deal for both of us. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to get as close to my target price as possible. Would you consider $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  I've reached the point where I'm not comfortable with Bob's offers. There's not much more room for negotiation, and I'm risking losing the deal entirely.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
