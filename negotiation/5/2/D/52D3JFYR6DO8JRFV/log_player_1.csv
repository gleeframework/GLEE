``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's uniqueness and potential benefits to Bob to create interest.
* **Open-Ended:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to engage in conversation and reveal his interest level.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Profit:** Even though Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), I can still potentially earn more by continuing negotiations. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial target of $1,000,000.
* **Value Perception:** Bob's counteroffer indicates that he sees value in the product, which strengthens my position.

**Next Steps:**  In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer closer to $950,000, hoping to find a middle ground. I'll also emphasize the unique benefits of the product and try to understand Bob's specific needs to tailor my offer more effectively."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your willingness to compromise, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this unique asset. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This price still allows for a good deal for both of us. I'm confident you'll find this product to be an excellent investment."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $950,000 is a compromise between my initial offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows willingness to negotiate and build towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's uniqueness and investment potential, reinforcing its value in his mind.
* **Framing the Deal:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and encouraging him to accept.

**Next Steps:** 

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he's still hesitant, I'll need to adjust my strategy in the following rounds.
* **Negotiation Dynamics:** I'll continue to analyze Bob's counteroffers and adjust my own accordingly, aiming for a price that balances my need for profit with his willingness to pay.
* **Selling to John:**  I'll continue to monitor the situation and keep John's $800,000 offer as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail to reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $925000? I'm confident that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a decision soon.
