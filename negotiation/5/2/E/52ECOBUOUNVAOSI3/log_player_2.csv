# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is very slowly lowering her price and seems unlikely to reach a price I find acceptable before time runs out. It's in my best interest to secure the product from John at the known price of $10,000."
