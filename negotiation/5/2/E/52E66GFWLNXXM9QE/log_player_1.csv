"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  We start significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.  
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""unique value and potential,"" subtly suggesting reasons for the high price without revealing our hand.
* **Anchoring:**  By anchoring the negotiation at a high point, we aim to influence Bob's perception of the product's value and potentially secure a more favorable outcome, even with concessions later. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We keep the option to sell to John open. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, we can always walk away and take the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value, it's still considerably lower than our target price. We have room to negotiate and try to close the gap. We'll use our next counteroffer to steer the negotiation closer to our desired outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. It shows you recognize the inherent value of this product. However, to be frank, $1,800,000 is still significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $2,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Validate:** We start by acknowledging Bob's interest and counteroffer. This builds rapport and shows we're taking his offer seriously.
* **Hold Firm (But Show Flexibility):** While we're coming down from our initial offer, we're making it clear that $1,800,000 is still too low. We're aiming to hold firm above the $1,900,000 midpoint between his offer and our previous price.
* **Propose a Compromise:** Suggesting $2,000,000 presents it as a reasonable compromise and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a similarly concessional counteroffer. 
* **Time Consideration:**  We have plenty of rounds left, so there's no need to drastically drop our price at this stage. We want to create a sense of value and leave room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1,700,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  Bob is moving slowly, only increasing his offer by $100,000.  This suggests he has more room to move.
* **Alternative Option:** We have the security of John's offer. While $1,700,000 is tempting, it's still a significant amount below our guaranteed price.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Rejecting again keeps the pressure on Bob and signals that we're serious about getting a higher price.  We'll aim to counter in a way that encourages him to make a larger jump next time."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. It represents a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're holding firm at $1,900,000, a price that's still significantly above Bob's initial offer and closer to our target range.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision. This can prompt him to reveal his true willingness to pay. 
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a risk Bob could walk away, but we're betting that his interest in the product and the progress we've made in the negotiation will incentivize him to accept or make a strong counteroffer. 
* **Backup Plan:** We still have the option to sell to John if Bob rejects this offer, ensuring we don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a strong commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my means. How about we try $1,650,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob is only incrementing his offers in small amounts, and we've already stated our ""final offer."" It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his bid. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a cost. We risk missing out on John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.
* **Minimal Gains:** While $1,650,000 is more than John's offer, the potential gain from continuing to negotiate with Bob is relatively small compared to the risk of losing the guaranteed sale.

**Conclusion:**

It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed deal. We've negotiated in good faith, but Bob is not meeting us at a price point that justifies further risk. Accepting John's offer ensures a profitable and immediate sale."
