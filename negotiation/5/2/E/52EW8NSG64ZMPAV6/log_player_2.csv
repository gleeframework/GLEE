{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $825,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get her to budge significantly.  Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option to ensure we stay within budget and acquire the product."
