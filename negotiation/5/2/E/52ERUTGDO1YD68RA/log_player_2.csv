"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is too high.  As Bob, I'm aiming to save as much money as possible. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $1,300,000 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** A counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer shows Bob's seriousness about negotiating and creates room for compromise.
* **Realistic price:** $1,300,000 is still above Alice's minimum selling price, so there's a chance she'll accept. 
* **Politeness:** The message remains friendly and keeps the door open for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're trying to get the best deal. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,350,000. This is a very fair price, considering the product's value. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and $1,350,000 is a reasonable compromise.
* **Value:** This price is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Time:** Accepting now avoids further negotiation rounds and potentially losing the deal to John."
