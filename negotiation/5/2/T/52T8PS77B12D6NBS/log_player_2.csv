Alice's offer is much higher than my budget and John's offer. I should try to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you meet me halfway at $12,000?

Alice is coming down, but $12,000 is still more than I want to spend and what John is offering. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
