# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make a deal at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice's price of $140 is lower than John's $150.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** You value the product at $150, and you can get it for $140, saving you $10."
