Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering this product to you for $15,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauging interest:**  A higher initial offer helps you gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you know he's very price-sensitive. 
* **Potential for higher profit:** If Bob accepts, you've made a significant profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you don't need to sell the product immediately. There's a chance Bob might walk away, but you're covered with John's offer."
