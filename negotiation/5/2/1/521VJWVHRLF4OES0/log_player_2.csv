"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your operations. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This represents a significant potential return on your investment. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up at $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
