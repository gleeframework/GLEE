"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm starting with a price of $1200000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,900000.0
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product holds for you. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This offer is a significant step towards your price, and I believe it still provides a fair return for me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,950000.0
"I appreciate the effort to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $900000, which would be $975000. Is that something we can discuss further?",975000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit too low considering the value this product brings to you.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a significant concession, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1000000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $975000, which would be $987500. Is that a price you'd be willing to consider?",987500.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm prepared to come down to $995000. This is a very fair price considering the immense value this product offers you. Let's finalize this deal.  What do you say?",995000.0,Alice,7,,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $995000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $995000 and $975000, which would be $985000. However, I'd like to propose a compromise - I'll meet you at $985000, but I'd like to negotiate the terms of the deal. Can we discuss some additional concessions or perks that would make up for the remaining difference?",985000.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I hear you on the need for additional concessions. While I'm not willing to make those, I am willing to meet you at $990000. This reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price for this product's value. Let's make this happen.  What do you say?",990000.0,Alice,9,,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer,980000.0
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1500000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement, but I need to make a decision soon.",980000.0,Bob,10,,
