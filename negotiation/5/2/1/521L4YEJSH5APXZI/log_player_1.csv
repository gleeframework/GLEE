I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. While $987,500 is closer to my desired price, I think I can still push for a slightly higher number."

Can we discuss some additional concessions or perks that would make up for the remaining difference?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  While I appreciate the proposal, the extra concessions he wants are not something I'm willing to give up.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price, but I'll keep John in mind as a backup."

Round 9

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1500000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement, but I need to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call. Bob's offer of $980,000 is very close to my desired price, but I've run out of rounds to negotiate.  At this point, it's safer to sell to John for $800,000. I'm guaranteed a sale and I'm not risking losing the deal entirely."
