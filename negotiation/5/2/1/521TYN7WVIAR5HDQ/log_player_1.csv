Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob. It is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I make a substantial profit. 

I chose this starting point because:

* **High starting point:** It puts the pressure on Bob to make the first concession. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** It allows for some give-and-take during the process, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale.
* **Maximizing potential profit:** It sets a high initial bar, potentially maximizing my earnings.

I will monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers or if he chooses to reject the deal. I will also keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my initial asking price of $1,500,000. While it's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it doesn't represent a good enough profit for me at this point. 

I'm going to reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round. I'll need to consider how determined Bob seems to be, and how much room for negotiation there is.  I will also keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a potential fallback if the negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

My counteroffer to Bob is $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $1,500,000, but it still leaves some room for negotiation while ensuring I make a decent profit.

Here's my reasoning:

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer is a halfway point between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining profit:** While it's a reduction, it still significantly surpasses my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Pressuring Bob:**  This counteroffer puts the pressure back on Bob to make the next move and potentially bring his offer closer to mine.

I believe this counteroffer strikes a balance between maximizing my profit and maintaining a good relationship with Bob.  It keeps the negotiation process moving forward while maintaining my position as the seller who holds the stronger hand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000, and while it's still lower than my ideal price, it represents a solid profit and a good outcome for me. 

Given Bob's persistence and the potential for further negotiation to drag on, I believe accepting his offer is the best course of action. It ensures a quick and profitable sale without risking a stalemate with Bob that could ultimately force me to accept John's lower offer."
