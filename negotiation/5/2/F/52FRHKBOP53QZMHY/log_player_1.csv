Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could aim higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), there's no guarantee he'd accept.  Here's why I'm offering it at his value:

* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Offering it at $100 ensures Bob will likely accept, as it matches his perceived value. 
* **No Risk of Losing the Sale:**  If I go higher and Bob rejects, I have to settle for John's offer, which is the same as Bob's value.

It's a bird in the hand situation. It's better to secure a sale at $100 than risk losing it by being overly ambitious."
