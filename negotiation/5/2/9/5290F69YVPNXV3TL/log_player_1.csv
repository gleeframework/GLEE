Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  It also ensures that Bob has an incentive to accept as he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,500. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  This leaves some room for Bob to accept, but also shows that I'm not willing to settle for his initial counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,200. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, and $9,200 is significantly better than selling to John for $8,000."
