"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,050,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $1,125,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,125,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,125,000 is still below my minimum price point. To make this work, I need to see $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. It's my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to move forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
