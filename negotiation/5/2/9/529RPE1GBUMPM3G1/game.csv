"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering its exceptional quality and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $450000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $450000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $675000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and market demand.",675000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, but $675000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $600000, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. Can you meet me at $600000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll make a new offer that's closer to your target. I'll sell the product to you for $650000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $650000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $580000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",580000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to walk away, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll make a new offer that's closer to your target. I'll sell the product to you for $610000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.",610000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $610000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $580000 and $610000, which is $595000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to commit to the purchase at this price.",595000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up just yet. I'll make a new offer that's slightly higher than your last offer. I'll sell the product to you for $605000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",605000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $595000, Alice. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to commit to the purchase at this price. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1000000.",595000.0,Bob,10,
