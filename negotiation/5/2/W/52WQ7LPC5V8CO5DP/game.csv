"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $13,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its unique qualities. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $16,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's find a price we can both agree on. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This shows my genuine interest in acquiring this unique product, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still feel that the product's value is worth more than $14,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer the product to you for $17,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in it.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see you're coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. My final offer is $15,000. This is a fair price considering our back-and-forth, and it allows me to acquire the product without breaking my budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",15000.0,Bob,6,
