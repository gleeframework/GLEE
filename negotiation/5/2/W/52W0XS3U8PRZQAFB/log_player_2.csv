"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is close to my maximum but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still comfortably above her value. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of getting a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you showing interest!  While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down close to her valuation, and further haggling might make her less willing to negotiate.  $125 is a good price and fits within my budget."
