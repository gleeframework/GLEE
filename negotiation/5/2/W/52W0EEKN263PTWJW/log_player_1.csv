Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest. I'm confident the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, and I'm hoping to get a good profit.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident in the product's value and want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. It's a compromise, but I still believe I can get a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer. I'm staying firm in my belief that this product is worth at least $1,200,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, we're already four rounds in and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. $1,125,000 is a good price and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
