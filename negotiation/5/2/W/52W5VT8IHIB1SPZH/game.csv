"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,500,000.  How about $1,600,000? This is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product, and it allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,750,000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the value I can get from the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
