Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation while still maintaining my profit margin.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages a positive response.

**Strategy:**

I'll keep in mind John's offer of $15,000 as a safety net. If Bob's counteroffers become too low or the negotiation drags on, I'll switch to John to ensure a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000 and well below my starting offer. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial counteroffer is unacceptable, it indicates he's interested in the product. I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

I will counter with a price that's closer to my desired price point, but still lower than my starting offer, hoping to find a middle ground. If Bob continues to offer significantly lower prices, I'll switch to John to guarantee a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($8,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and could encourage Bob to accept.
* **Highlighting Fairness:**  My message emphasizes the ""fair deal"" aspect, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  The offer of $10,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out on profit.

**Strategy:**

I'm using a ""meet in the middle"" approach as a common negotiation tactic. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider a slightly lower counteroffer, but I'll be prepared to switch to John if necessary to guarantee a profit."
