Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the same as what John is offering.  Since I'm trying to maximize my profit, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice."
