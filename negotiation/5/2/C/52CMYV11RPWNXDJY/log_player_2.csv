**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, Alice is offering it for $900,000. This saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You still get a good deal:** You're buying the product for less than its value to you, so it's a good deal."
