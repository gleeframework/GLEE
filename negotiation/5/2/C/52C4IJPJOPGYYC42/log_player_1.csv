Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **My minimum:**  I need at least $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Negotiation space:** I have a good chance of getting more than my minimum since Bob values it higher.
* **Risk mitigation:**  A price of $950,000 is a good compromise, giving Bob a significant discount while still ensuring I earn a considerable profit.

This offer gives Bob a good deal, increasing the likelihood of him accepting while still allowing me to earn a large sum of money."
