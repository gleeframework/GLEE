"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its value. How about we meet halfway at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While $750,000 is still below my initial assessment, I recognize your willingness to negotiate.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
