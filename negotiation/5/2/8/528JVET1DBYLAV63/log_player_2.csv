Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $125, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's a fair price for the product's quality and value.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $125, and my goal is to get the best possible price. John offers a guaranteed price of $120, which is better than Alice's current offer."
