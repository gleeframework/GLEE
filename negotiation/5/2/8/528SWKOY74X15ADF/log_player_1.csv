I'm starting with a price of $120, hoping to get a good profit. If Bob rejects, we'll see how the negotiations play out."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm going to counter with $110. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's a more reasonable price for Bob."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to hold out for a little more. I'm not sure how much longer Bob is willing to negotiate, but I think I can get closer to $100 with another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
