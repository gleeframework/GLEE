Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it would be valuable to you, so I'm willing to part with it for $19,000.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your minimum:** You need to make at least $15,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000.
* **Creating surplus:** To entice Bob, you need to leave some ""surplus"" for him.  Offering it at $19,000 might seem high, but it allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still above your minimum. 
* **Alternative in your pocket:** You have the security of John's offer, so you can afford to start higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Negotiation is complex, and there's no guarantee Bob will go for this price. You might have to adjust your approach based on his response."
