Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This allows room for negotiation while ensuring I make a profit.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the value of the product to make the offer more appealing. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximizes Potential Profit:** Starting high gives me the most room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Keeps John as a Safety Net:**  I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails.
* **Builds a Foundation for Negotiation:** This sets the stage for a back-and-forth that could potentially lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a loss for me. 
* While I could counter with a price between $125 and $150, there's no guarantee that Bob will accept. 
* Given John's offer of $150, I'm in a stronger position to reject Bob's offer and potentially negotiate a better price in the next round or simply sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $125 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This would still allow me to cover my costs and make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $140 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, but significantly lower than my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I maintain a friendly tone and reiterate the value of the product while explaining my reasoning for the price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer allows for potential further negotiation while ensuring a profit for me if accepted. It also leaves room to reject Bob's next counteroffer if necessary and still sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a better outcome.  Given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, it's in my best interest to accept his offer and maximize my profit."
