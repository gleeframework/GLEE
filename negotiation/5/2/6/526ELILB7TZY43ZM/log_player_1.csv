Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum of $15,000 as possible, but I also want to keep Bob interested in the deal.  Offering $14,000 gives him some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price if I keep negotiating.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling.  I'm confident I can get closer to $15,000 with continued negotiation.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,200 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle at $13,400. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 13400}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,300 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. We are down to only 4 rounds left and I am confident that I can get a better offer from Bob. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $13,300 is still a bit low for me.  Given the value of this product, and the fact we're nearing the end of our negotiation, I'm offering $13,400 one last time. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 13400}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $13,350 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, as $13,350 is very close to my minimum. However, with only two rounds left, there's not much room for negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and I'd rather secure that than risk a counteroffer that could leave me with a lower price."
