{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a competitive price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't settle for less than this amount. 

By offering the product at $14,000, Alice aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob."
