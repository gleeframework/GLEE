"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? It's a great price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $88.50. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to reach an agreement.",88.5,Bob,4,
