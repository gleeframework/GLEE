Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value you're offering, $15,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering my own valuation and your need to sell.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference and meet at $9,500. This is a fair price considering both our valuations and the urgency to finalize this deal.

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is highly unlikely to go above his last offer of $9,000.  Continuing the negotiation will likely result in a lower final price, or risk losing John's guaranteed offer. Accepting John's offer of $12,000 is the most profitable and secure option at this point."
