**Reasoning:**  

Alice is clearly very attached to getting a price above $11,000. Her counteroffers are consistently moving away from a reasonable compromise. At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price lower than John's offer of $12,000. It's time to cut losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
