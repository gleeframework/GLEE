"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $750,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $675,000? That's a fair compromise.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $680,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",680000.0,Alice,5,
