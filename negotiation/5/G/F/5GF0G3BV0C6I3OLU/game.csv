"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is simply not enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would be a fair compromise, and it would allow us to finalize this deal. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $11,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750, which is the best I can do. Can you consider this offer?",10750.0,Bob,8,
