"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value and the ""deal"" aspect to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly implies I'm open to discussing the price.

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation process open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.** While it's closer to my desired price than his previous offer, I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000 at this point. 
* **I have 8 rounds left.** This gives me ample opportunity to negotiate further and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is always an option.** While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $15,000, I believe I can secure a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering Strategically:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not rejecting it outright. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my position.
* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $10,500 is a significant compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while remaining well above my minimum. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product, subtly reminding Bob why he should be willing to pay more. 
* **Maintaining Openness:**  The message ends by asking for Bob's thoughts, keeping the negotiation open and inviting further dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but still below my minimum value of $12,000.** While it's tempting to accept and secure a deal, I believe I can still push for a better price.
* **I have 6 rounds remaining.** There's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Selling to John is always an option.** However, I'm confident that I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer, showing a genuine attempt to reach a compromise.
* **Enthusiasm and Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency and enthusiasm to the message, subtly suggesting that this could be the final offer.
* **Highlighting the Deal:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario, emphasizing the benefit for both parties.

This strategy aims to close the deal quickly while securing a price that's close to my minimum acceptable value."

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $12,000.** While it's tempting to accept and secure a deal, I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is simply not enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would be a fair compromise, and it would allow us to finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer, signaling that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Reiterating Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise to emphasize that I'm not just trying to squeeze every last dollar out of Bob.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using language like ""finalize this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

With only three rounds remaining, this is my final attempt to get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value while still keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $11,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750, which is the best I can do. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** I have only two rounds left.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $12,000.** There is a significant gap between our desired prices.
* **Selling to John guarantees my minimum value.** It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 than risk losing time and ultimately getting a worse deal with Bob.

Although I would prefer to secure a deal with Bob, the remaining time and the price difference make it more advantageous to sell to John."
