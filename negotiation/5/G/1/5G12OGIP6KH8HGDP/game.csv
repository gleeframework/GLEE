,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9200, which is still a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9200.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8900 is still a bit too far off from what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9050? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",9050.0,Alice,5,
