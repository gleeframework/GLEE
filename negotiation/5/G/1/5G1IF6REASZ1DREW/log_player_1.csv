Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to purchase the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?

Round 6

Bob has now met John's offer.  While we could try to push for more, there's a risk Bob will walk away. It's a good business decision to accept the sure thing at this point."
