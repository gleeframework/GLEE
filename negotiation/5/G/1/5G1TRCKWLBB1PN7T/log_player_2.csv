"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Targeting a Fair Deal:** Our goal is to get the product for a price significantly lower than John's $120 offer, while still offering Alice a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to $100. Would that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming to get the price closer to $90, and it's unlikely she'll accept that immediately. Let's counter-offer and see how she responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $95, we're splitting the difference between our last offer ($90) and her current offer ($100). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  We're keeping the negotiation moving forward and demonstrating that we're serious about purchasing the product.
* **Still Below John's Price:**  Our offer remains significantly below John's backup price of $120."
