"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,300,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob.**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,300,000. This means Bob can save $200,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  If Bob rejects Alice's offer, he'll have to buy from John for $1,500,000, which is a worse deal. 

Therefore, Bob should accept Alice's offer to save money."
