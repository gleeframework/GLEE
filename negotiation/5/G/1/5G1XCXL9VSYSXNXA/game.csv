"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $700,000? I believe that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a great compromise, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $825,000 is still a little bit outside of my budget.  Would you consider $750,000?  That would be a great spot for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $825,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers and propose a price of $787,500. This is a very competitive offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",787500.0,Alice,5,
