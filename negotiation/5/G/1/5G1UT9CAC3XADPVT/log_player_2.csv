"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000, a price that I believe reflects its true value and worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a counter-offer, potentially saving you even more money before you have to resort to buying from John at $1,200,000."
