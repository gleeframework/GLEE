"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $850000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down, but $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,4,
