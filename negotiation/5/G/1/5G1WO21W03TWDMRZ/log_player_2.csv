"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $9,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** Alice values the product at $8,000.  
* **Your Value:** You value the product at $12,000.
* **Negotiation Space:**  This leaves a negotiation space of $4,000 ($12,000 - $8,000).
* **Counteroffer:**  Offering $7,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential compromise.

This counteroffer is aggressive, but it might encourage Alice to come down from her initial offer and make a counteroffer herself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $8,500
* **Your value:** $12,000
* **John's price:** $12,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $3,500 compared to buying from John.  This is a significant saving, and it's likely you won't get a lower price from Alice in the remaining rounds."
