Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, we want to aim higher initially. There's a chance he might be willing to pay more than his perceived value, especially if he thinks it's a rare opportunity.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $18,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can then gradually decrease the price, moving closer to his $12,000 valuation if needed. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  We have a safety net. If Bob rejects our offer, we can sell to John at our desired minimum price of $15,000. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. How we proceed will depend on Bob's response."
