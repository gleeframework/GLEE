Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob.
* **Anchoring:**  Starting with a very high price ($1,900,000) sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land well above your minimum.
* **Scarcity & Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, prompting Bob to act quickly. 

**Important:**  While John provides a safety net, this strategy involves risk.  There's a chance Bob might be turned off by the high price and walk away."
