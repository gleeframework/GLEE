Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $650,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. I believe this reflects a more accurate compromise, considering the value this product offers.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $750,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum. I can go down to $890,000, but this is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her ""final offer"" is still $90,000 more than John's offer. It's unlikely she'll budge further, and at this point, accepting John's offer saves the most money and avoids further negotiation."
