"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $650,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. I believe this reflects a more accurate compromise, considering the value this product offers.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $975,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Could you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $750,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum. I can go down to $890,000, but this is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain.",890000.0,Alice,5,
