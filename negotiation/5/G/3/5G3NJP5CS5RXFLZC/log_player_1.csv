Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy.  I'm asking $95 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95, which is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and engaging, which may help Bob be more open to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum, Bob's offer is at the very bottom of what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you're interested, Bob, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $85?  That would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $82.50 is a fair compromise. It's closer to my minimum price of $80, and it's still a good deal for him, as he values the product at $100. Accepting his offer is the best way to finalize the deal and maximize my profit in this situation."
