"Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
