"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $10,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $12,250. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest,  $11,500 is the highest I can go.  If that doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'm hoping we can make a deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
