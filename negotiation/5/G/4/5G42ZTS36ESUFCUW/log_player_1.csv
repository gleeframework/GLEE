Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset with such significant potential return."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John offers a safety net, Alice can be more assertive with her initial offer to Bob."
