"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. I'm going to counteroffer at $950000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand you're trying to get a fair price for your product, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $925000 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider my offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,
