"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better.  There are still 9 rounds to negotiate and Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  $12,000 is still above his ideal price.  He has 7 rounds left to negotiate, and there's a good chance Alice will lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try $11,750. This is a fair price that takes both our interests into account. I'm ready to close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has successfully negotiated the price down significantly.  $11,750 is still below his maximum budget, and he has saved $3,250 compared to John's price.  Given that Alice seems committed to closing the deal at this price, Bob should accept the offer. It's unlikely that he'll be able to get a better deal in the remaining rounds."
