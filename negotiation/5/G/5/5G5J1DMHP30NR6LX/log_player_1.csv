""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic deal for something that will undoubtedly benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,150,000 offer is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) making it unlikely he'll try to negotiate much lower.
    * Still a substantial discount from the guaranteed sale price, making it attractive to Bob.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  Framing the offer as exclusive adds perceived value and might make Bob more inclined to accept."
