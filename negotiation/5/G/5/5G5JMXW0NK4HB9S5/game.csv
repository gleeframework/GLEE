,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $150, which is what I'm comfortable spending. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $165 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that price?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to split the difference and pay $157.50.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",157.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $157.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $168. Would you be willing to consider that price?",168.0,Alice,5,
