Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is already higher than our minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee we'll get a better offer in future rounds. Let's accept.
