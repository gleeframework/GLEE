"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept due to the time constraint, I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another round of counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my value."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my value. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I have a few more rounds to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm offering $11,500, which is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still leaves room for compromise. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While the time is running out, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is too far below my minimum value, and I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my target in the next round. If we can't reach an agreement, I can still sell to John for a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offers, but still holding out for a price that's a bit more beneficial for me. With only a few rounds left, I need to strike a balance between getting a decent price and potentially losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price. To ensure I get my desired price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
