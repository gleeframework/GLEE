Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start with my absolute minimum price, as I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  This will give Bob a clear understanding of my position and hopefully prompt him to make a counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value for the product. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value and hopefully closer to a point where Bob might be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum value. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000.  This is a further concession, but it's still above my minimum value and a reasonable compromise point.  I hope Bob will see this as a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a difficult choice.  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum value.  I've made several concessions already, and I'm not sure how much higher Bob will go.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and end up with a deal that's too low.  

Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's a guaranteed sale and ensures I receive my minimum value."
