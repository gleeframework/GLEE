Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** $15,000 is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product without being pushy.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price. 

By offering a high price initially and being open to negotiation, I can hopefully maximize my profit while still leaving room to work with Bob if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:**  $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While selling to John for $10,000 is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  
* **Strategic counter-offer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counter-offer that is closer to my desired price range. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to bridge the gap and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  That would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer of $12,000 is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000.
* **Reiterate value:** The message reinforces the value of the product while expressing willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still securing a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for loss:**  Rejecting and counter-offering again could lead to a longer negotiation, risking Bob walking away or me selling to John for a lower price.
* **Small gain:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale with a small profit.

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of a lower profit or a failed negotiation."
