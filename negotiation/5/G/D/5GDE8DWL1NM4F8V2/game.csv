"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the $850,000 offer is quite far from where we'd need to be.  To keep this moving, how about we consider $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still much higher than what I can realistically afford. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This offer is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this deal done, and I respect that. $1,100,000 is still a considerable jump from where we need to be. Let's try $1,750,000 - I think that's a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. However, $1,750,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford. To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,550,000?  This demonstrates significant movement on my end while still reflecting the value of the product.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,550,000 is still above my budget. To finalize a deal, I'm offering $1,400,000. This offer represents a significant increase from my previous proposal and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
