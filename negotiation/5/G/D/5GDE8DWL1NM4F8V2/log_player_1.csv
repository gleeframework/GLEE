Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This offer is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,550,000 is still above my budget. To finalize a deal, I'm offering $1,400,000. This offer represents a significant increase from my previous proposal and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to move substantially beyond his current offer of $1,400,000.  While we could try to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal and getting a worse outcome is higher than the potential reward of a slightly better offer from Bob. Accepting John's offer guarantees the $1,500,000 and avoids further negotiation."
