"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $110. This is a good price, but you can likely do better.
* You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $95?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth a lot to me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her offer to $105, which is still a good price for you considering your maximum budget is $120.
* You've already made a counteroffer and were rejected, so continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.
* Accepting the offer allows you to acquire the product for a decent price while also ensuring you don't miss out on the opportunity."
