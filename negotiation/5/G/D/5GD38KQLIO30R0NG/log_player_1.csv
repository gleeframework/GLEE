Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer,  while still ensuring you get more than your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message aims to subtly nudge Bob towards accepting by highlighting the ""deal"" aspect without explicitly mentioning your minimum price.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. However, this strategy optimizes your chances of a profitable sale before resorting to the guaranteed $120 from John."
