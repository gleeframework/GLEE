"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value of this product is far greater than what you're proposing.  Let's find a middle ground - how about we meet halfway at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your budget, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go as low as $800,000. Would you be willing to consider $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,5,
