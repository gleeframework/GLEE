"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's see if we can make this work!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
