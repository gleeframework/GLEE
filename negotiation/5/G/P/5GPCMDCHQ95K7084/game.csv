"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  I hope you'll consider it.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $900,000. However, I still think the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $950,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
