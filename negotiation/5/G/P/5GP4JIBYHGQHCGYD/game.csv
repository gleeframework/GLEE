"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Could we settle on something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I see the value in the product, $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $750,000? I think that would be a fair deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell the product for. If you're interested, I can finalize the deal at this price. If not, I'm open to discussing further, but I won't go lower than this.",800000.0,Alice,5,,
