Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. This is still a fair price for the product, considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate further with Bob. Let's see if we can nudge him closer to our desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. To be frank,  $1,700,000 is quite a way off from what I had in mind, and I have other interested parties.  Let's make this simple â€“ I'm willing to accept $1,900,000 as my final offer. This is a significant discount, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,900,000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,750,000 is still a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
