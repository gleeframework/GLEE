"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. This is still a fair price for the product, considering its value and potential.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is significantly below my initial asking price and doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to see a more realistic counteroffer from you.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,700,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. To be frank,  $1,700,000 is quite a way off from what I had in mind, and I have other interested parties.  Let's make this simple â€“ I'm willing to accept $1,900,000 as my final offer. This is a significant discount, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,900,000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for it.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
