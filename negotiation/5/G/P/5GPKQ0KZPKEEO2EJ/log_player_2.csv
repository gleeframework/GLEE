Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is significantly below my initial asking price and doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to see a more realistic counteroffer from you.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. To be frank,  $1,700,000 is quite a way off from what I had in mind, and I have other interested parties.  Let's make this simple â€“ I'm willing to accept $1,900,000 as my final offer. This is a significant discount, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?
