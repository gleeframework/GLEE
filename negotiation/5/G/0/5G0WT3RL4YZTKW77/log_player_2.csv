Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.
