"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, considering your value and my budget. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair price.
