"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  You can definitely get a better price than $950,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, considering your value and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above her minimum value.  It's a bold move that shows you're serious about getting a good deal, but it also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to your desired price point. Accepting this offer saves you $650,000 compared to buying from John. While you might be able to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
