"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $175 and $100, which would be $137.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",137.5,Alice,5,
