"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get closer to our desired price.  Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort and willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still a bit short.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $925,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve a reasonable outcome. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
