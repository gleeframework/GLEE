"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $13,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties expressing interest in this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $16,000. Is that more to your liking? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $16,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price.  There's still room for negotiation before he needs to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  How about $14,000? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot of time and resources into this product, and $14,000 is still below my minimum. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money. I can do $15,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  He has two rounds left before he'll need to consider buying from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can reach a price closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $15,500 is still more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to go to $14,500. This is really the absolute maximum I can offer.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,750, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to explore other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  

While Alice's offer of $14,750 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his budget. With only three rounds remaining, the chances of getting Alice to agree to his price point are slim. 

Buying from John at $12,000 ensures that Bob stays within his budget and gets the product he wants."
