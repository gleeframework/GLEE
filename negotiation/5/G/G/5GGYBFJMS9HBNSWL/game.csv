"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can only offer $140 right now. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $140 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $160? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $155? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
