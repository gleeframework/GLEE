"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I believe you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you have a better alternative. You know John will sell you the same product for $10,000.  Your goal is to save money, and buying from John achieves that."
