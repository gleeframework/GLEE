Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8,900, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,150. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $9,150 saves you a significant amount compared to John's offer ($12,000) and avoids the risk of Alice increasing her price in the final round."
