Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is a significant saving from her initial offer of $950,000 and a much better deal than buying from John.  It's a good compromise, and Bob should accept to secure the product at a good price."
