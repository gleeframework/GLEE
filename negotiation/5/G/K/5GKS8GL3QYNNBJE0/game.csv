"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is the maximum I am willing to spend, as it aligns better with my budget constraints. I hope this proposal works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make at least $11,500 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This way we can both walk away with a good deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
