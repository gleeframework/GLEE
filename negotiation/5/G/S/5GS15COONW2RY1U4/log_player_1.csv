This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $12,000 but below my minimum of $15,000. It gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and if he rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
