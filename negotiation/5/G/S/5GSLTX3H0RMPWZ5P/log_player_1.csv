Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price of $130, closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) than my minimum ($80). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (""fair price considering its worth"") can make Bob more receptive than just stating a number.
* **Not Too Aggressive:**  While I want to maximize profit, starting at $150 might immediately turn Bob off. $130 leaves room for him to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's willingness to pay:** His response will indicate if he's willing to pay near my asking price or if I need to significantly adjust.
2. **Maintain a strong position:**  Even if he rejects the offer, I'm still in a good position for further negotiation. 
3. **Avoid leaving too much money on the table:** I don't want to undervalue the product by starting too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent profit, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my initial offer. Bob's message indicates he's budget-conscious but still sees the value in the product. By rejecting and countering, I aim to meet somewhere in the middle while avoiding a lowball settlement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? That reflects a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $115, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Justification:**  Framing it as a ""fair compromise"" and ""meeting in the middle"" appeals to a sense of fairness and collaboration.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer keeps me above the midpoint between our previous offers ($115 vs. $105 average), maintaining a stronger negotiating stance. 

This approach aims to:

1. **Encourage agreement:** The compromise might be appealing enough for Bob to accept.
2. **Maintain profitability:** I'm still securing a good profit margin above my minimum.
3. **Continue negotiation:**  If rejected, there's still room for further discussion and potentially settling closer to $115."
