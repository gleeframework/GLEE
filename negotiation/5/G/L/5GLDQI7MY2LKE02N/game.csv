"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12,000. Would you consider reducing the price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $13,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet halfway, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to see eye to eye on this.  I'm prepared to go down to $13,500. This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options.",13500.0,Alice,5,
