"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to entice him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12,000. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, I can get a better deal. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $13,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet halfway, I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of your product, I am still looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $12,500 if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm hoping I can squeeze out a bit more in the next round.  I'm getting closer to the number of rounds where selling to John becomes the more attractive option, but I want to see if I can get Bob to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to see eye to eye on this.  I'm prepared to go down to $13,500. This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm starting to get a bit more firm in my negotiation. I'm making it clear that this is my last concession, and I'm putting the pressure on Bob to make a decision. I'm also reminding him that I have other options available."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $13,000 if possible. This seems to be closer to our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is close to my bottom line and we are running out of rounds.  It's time to take the deal and move on."
