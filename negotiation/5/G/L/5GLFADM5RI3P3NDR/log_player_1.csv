``` 
 
My strategy is to start high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
