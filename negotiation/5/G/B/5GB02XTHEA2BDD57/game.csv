"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's value, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,4,
