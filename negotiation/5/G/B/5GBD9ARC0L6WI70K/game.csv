"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $11,500?  That feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
