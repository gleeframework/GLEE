"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I've given this some thought, and to be candid, $1,800,000 falls short of what I had in mind.  I'm willing to move down a bit, but to make this work, I'd need to see a figure closer to $2,100,000. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
