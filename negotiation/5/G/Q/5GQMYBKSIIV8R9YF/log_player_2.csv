"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product from John for much less.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as he may be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  That's my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're willing to work with me."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is your maximum, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than $18,000, it's still over Bob's budget. He can get the same product from John for $8,000, so it makes sense to keep negotiating with Alice, hoping to get a lower price or move on to John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, and I'm willing to pay $9,000. That's my final offer, and it's the most I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice is unwilling to go lower than $11,000, and that's still above Bob's budget.  John is offering the product for a price that Bob can afford. It's time to take the deal and move on."
