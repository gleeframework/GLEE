"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  That's my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're willing to work with me.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is your maximum, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, and I'm willing to pay $9,000. That's my final offer, and it's the most I can afford. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
