"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $90? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $90 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $105. It's the best I can do, considering the product's value and my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on price, she's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $100.  At this point, it's more strategic to cut your losses and buy from John to guarantee you get the product at the best possible price."
