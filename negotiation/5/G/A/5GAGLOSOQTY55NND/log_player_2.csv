"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, potentially saving yourself some money. There's always the option to buy from John for $800,000 if the negotiation with Alice fails."

After re-evaluating the situation, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000.
