"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $837,500 for the product. This is a fair offer, considering both our positions, and I believe it's a strong step towards reaching an agreement. ",837500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. After re-evaluating the situation, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this revised offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
