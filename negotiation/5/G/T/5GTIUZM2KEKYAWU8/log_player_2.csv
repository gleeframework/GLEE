"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has 10 rounds, so rejecting the initial offer allows for potentially getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $950,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It's a strong starting point for Bob's counteroffers and tests Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a better price than the initial $1,100,000, it's still higher than Bob's counteroffer. Bob wants to save as much money as possible and has 7 rounds left.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round.  He wants to show Alice that he is willing to negotiate but also that he's not going to drastically raise his offer. This approach keeps pressure on Alice to compromise while still allowing room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,025,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. He has 5 rounds left, so there's still potential to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's offer but still pushing for a lower price.  $990,000 is a good compromise point, and if Alice rejects, Bob still has more rounds to negotiate. This offer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also firm on his desire to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a good deal for Bob. He's saved $200,000 compared to buying from John, and there's only a small chance he can get a lower price in the remaining rounds.  Given the limited time and the potential for Alice to become less flexible, accepting the offer is the most logical choice."
