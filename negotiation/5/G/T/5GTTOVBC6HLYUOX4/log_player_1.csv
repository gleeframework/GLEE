Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a significant premium over my guaranteed minimum value from John, but I believe it's a price that still leaves room for Bob to benefit from acquiring the product. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A higher price means potentially more profit for me.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob rejects, I know his perceived value is below $950,000 and I can adjust accordingly with future buyers. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  While $950,000 is my starting point, I am open to negotiating if Bob counters with a reasonable offer."
