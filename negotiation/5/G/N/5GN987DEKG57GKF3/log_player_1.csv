Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting with $180 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum price. 
* **Value Highlighting:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing the chances he might be willing to pay a premium.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could start with a lower price if you prefer a quicker sale and are less concerned about maximizing profit."
