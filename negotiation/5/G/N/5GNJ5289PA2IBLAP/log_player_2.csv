Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I was thinking of a price that's a bit higher than $9,000. I can do $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

We're getting close, but there's still room to negotiate. Alice seems pretty firm on $9,500, but we'll try one more time to nudge it down a bit before considering accepting or going with John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,250 is my final offer.  If you can't do that, I'll have to go with John, even though I'd rather work with you."", ""product_price"": 9250}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I think I can do a bit better than $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,375. That's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has come down quite a bit, and while we could potentially squeeze out a few more dollars, it's getting risky.  $9,375 is a good price, and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk Alice walking away or running out of rounds."
