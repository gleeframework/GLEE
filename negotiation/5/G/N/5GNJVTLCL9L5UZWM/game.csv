"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  While I understand the product's value, my budget is firm. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to be flexible, Bob, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is closer to my minimum price. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $800,000? This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I've been very patient, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
