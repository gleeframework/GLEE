"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1200000 to me. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $800000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is the maximum you're willing to pay. However, I believe the product's value is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1000000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've learned about your budget. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, which is closer to my target budget. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is still a bit above your target budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $950000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product, which is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher than this. Can you consider this offer?",920000.0,Bob,6,
