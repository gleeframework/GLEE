"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900,000? It's a win-win, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Starting Low:** I want to anchor the negotiation lower. While $900,000 is a significant jump, it leaves room for me to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my $1,000,000 limit and Alice's initial offer.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone is important to encourage Alice to continue negotiating.
* **Seeking a Win-Win:**  By framing the counteroffer as mutually beneficial, I hope to make it more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise and still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Alice coming down to $1,050,000 shows she's willing to negotiate.  There's a good chance she might go lower, getting me closer to my ideal price.
* **John as Backup:** I'm comfortable rejecting this offer because I have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 if needed. This gives me leverage."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000 even?  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** I'm being direct this time, stating my final offer to signal I'm serious.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This common negotiation tactic can feel like a fair compromise to Alice.
* **My Limit:** This price matches what John offers, removing any incentive to negotiate further with Alice if she rejects it."
