"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900,000? It's a win-win, don't you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise and still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000 even?  That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
