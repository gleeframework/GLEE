"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,400,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,525,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1525000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,400,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,450,000? I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
