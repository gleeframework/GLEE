"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's still a great price for you, and I can make it work.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I really like the product, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to budge a little more, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'd like to propose a price of $8,750 for the product. This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get closer to my price, but I'm still not at a point where I can go that low.  Let's try $9,000.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,875 for the product. This would be a fair compromise between our previous offers.",8875.0,Bob,8,
