Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a wise investment."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting with a higher offer ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming to maximize profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" to justify the high price, potentially making Bob more amenable to the offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will purchase it at my desired minimum ($1,000,000). 

This strategy prioritizes potential for higher profit while minimizing risk."
