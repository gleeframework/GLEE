Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but $75 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $85. I think it's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

It's time to cut our losses.  Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and we can get the product for $80 from John."
