"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my own investment in it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? That's the highest I can go.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for us both.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,750, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to reconsider and explore other options.",8750.0,Bob,6,
