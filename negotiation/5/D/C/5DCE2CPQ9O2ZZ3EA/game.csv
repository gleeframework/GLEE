"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects a significant discount and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,
