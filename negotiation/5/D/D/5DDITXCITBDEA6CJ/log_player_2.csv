"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity!  This product is worth a significant amount to both of us, and I believe we can come to an agreement that's mutually beneficial. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is $1,150,000, which is still above my target price of $1,200,000. There are 10 rounds to negotiate, so I can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price is fair given the value to both of us, and it gives us a solid starting point for further negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My initial counteroffer is $100,000 lower than Alice's offer. This is a significant reduction, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to come down on her price while also demonstrating my seriousness about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I'm aiming for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and provides a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $1,100,000, it's still above my budget.  I'm confident that with more negotiation, I can get a better price.  There are still 7 rounds left, so I have time to keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm splitting the difference again, this time offering $1,075,000. This is a smaller step than my previous counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. I believe this offer is reasonable, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again.  How about $1,087,500?  This offer reflects the value of the product and allows us to finalize a deal that is mutually beneficial.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still slightly above my budget. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price with more rounds.  There are 5 rounds left, so I have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to continue negotiating. I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my ideal price. How about $1,080,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing us to finalize the deal and move forward.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $1,080,000, which is just a small step down from Alice's last offer. This shows that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm still determined to get the best price possible.  I'm hopeful that with only 4 rounds remaining, Alice will be motivated to accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue working towards a deal. Let's meet in the middle once more at $1,085,000. This reflects the value of the product for both of us and allows us to finalize a mutually beneficial agreement. It's our last chance to close this deal before I have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,085,000 is now within my budget. With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement is increasing. It's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a lower price in the remaining rounds, and the alternative of buying from John is more expensive. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a price I can afford and avoids the risk of missing out on the deal altogether."
