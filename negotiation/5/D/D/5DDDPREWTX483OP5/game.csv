"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential customer, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could close this deal quickly.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a fair deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $875,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $845,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident that our product will bring significant value to your business. What do you think?",845000.0,Alice,5,
