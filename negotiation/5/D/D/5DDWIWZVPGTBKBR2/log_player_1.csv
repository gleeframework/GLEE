Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is a significant amount for Bob but still below his perceived value of $1,200,000. This gives him room to negotiate and encourages him to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There is a good margin between my offer and John's offer ($1,000,000). This allows for potential counteroffers and negotiations without risking losing the deal completely.
* **Friendly Approach:**  Using a friendly tone in the message can build rapport and potentially increase the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's tempting to take the $1,050,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Room for counteroffer:** I can still make a counteroffer and hopefully close the gap between our positions. There's still a chance Bob will accept a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Avoiding immediate loss:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a guaranteed outcome, but rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer but also not completely rejecting him. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is halfway between my previous offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's offer of $1,050,000. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify my price.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1080000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **No further negotiation:** There is very little room for further counteroffers without risking losing the deal completely. 
* **Securing the deal:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of him backing out entirely or me selling to John for a lower price."
