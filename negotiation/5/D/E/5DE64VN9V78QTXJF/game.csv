"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for it. Can you consider this offer?",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more, how about $11,200?  This would still give you a great deal, and it would be a fair price for me. Let's see if we can make this happen!",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,900 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,050?  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",11050.0,Alice,5,
