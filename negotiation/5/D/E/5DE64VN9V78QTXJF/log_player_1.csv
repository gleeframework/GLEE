"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,800 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and there's a chance he might be willing to pay more. I also have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more, how about $11,200?  This would still give you a great deal, and it would be a fair price for me. Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $10,900 is still too low.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident that I can get a better price. I have 6 more rounds left to negotiate with Bob and the option to sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,900 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,050?  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11050}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,950 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,950 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've negotiated for 5 rounds, and there are only 4 more rounds left. At this point, it's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to get a better price from Bob.  It's in my best interest to sell to John for $12,000 and guarantee myself the minimum acceptable price."
