"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me is $8,000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, and there's a chance I can get a better deal from Bob or sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my assessment of the product's value, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I still have six rounds left and the potential to get a better deal from Bob or sell to John for a much higher price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer. However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the product's value to both of us and gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is a slight improvement, it's still not close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I have four rounds left and I'm confident I can either get a better deal from Bob or sell to John for a much higher price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $10,500 is still too low for me. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to go down to $11,500.  This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the outcome.  Let's try to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your patience and willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offers, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  We are down to the final two rounds, and the time to get my desired price from Bob is running out. Since John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's in my best interest to sell to him and secure the best possible deal."
