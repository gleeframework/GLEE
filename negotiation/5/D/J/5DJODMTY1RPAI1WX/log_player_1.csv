Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for $15,000 (its value to you), there's a chance Bob might reject it.  Offering it slightly lower increases the likelihood of a sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Exceed Bob's Value:** The offer is still higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), but not by so much that it's insulting.

**Why this strategy is better than offering the product for $15,000:**

By offering the product at $14,000, Alice increases her chances of making a sale to Bob. Even if Bob negotiates the price down slightly, Alice is still likely to get a better price than John's offer of $15,000."
