Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but leaves some room for negotiation.  Bob has a strong incentive to accept as he'll still make a profit of $50,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's worth taking a gamble and seeing if you can get a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a slight compromise from your original offer but still allows you to make a decent profit. It's also high enough to make Bob think about accepting, as it still leaves him a sizable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what you are willing to accept. While continuing to negotiate could potentially yield a better price, there's no guarantee, and it risks losing time.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
