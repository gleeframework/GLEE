Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $130."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell to John for $100, but aiming higher with Bob is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $130 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets the product for $20 less than its worth to him, and you make a $30 profit compared to selling to John.

This initial offer allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while keeping the price closer to your desired outcome."
