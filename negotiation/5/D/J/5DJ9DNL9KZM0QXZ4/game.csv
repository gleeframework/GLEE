"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This would allow us both to get a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $875,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $825,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to be frugal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $875,000. I'll consider $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
