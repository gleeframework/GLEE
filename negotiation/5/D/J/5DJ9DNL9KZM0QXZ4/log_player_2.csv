"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good price, it's still over Bob's ideal price of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This would allow us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $875,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for $800,000. While $875,000 is getting closer, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  He should try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $825,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to be frugal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $875,000. I'll consider $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price:** While $850,000 is still above Bob's goal, it's a significant improvement from previous offers.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob has already rejected Alice's previous offers, and if he continues to reject, there's a chance Alice will walk away from the deal entirely.
* **Opportunity cost:** If Bob rejects this offer, he might not get a better one from Alice.  He could also risk losing time and potentially end up having to buy from John for $800,000.

Considering these factors, accepting Alice's offer at $850,000 is the most logical choice for Bob in this round. He saves a considerable amount compared to the initial offer, and it's likely a good compromise given the current negotiation trajectory."
