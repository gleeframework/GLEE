{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good to start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation. $15,000 gives us some wiggle room while still being a reasonable starting point. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Showing willingness to negotiate makes Bob feel like he has some control and is more likely to engage.
* **Positive Framing:**  Highlighting the product's value (""fantastic"") can make Bob more interested. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  We need to see how Bob responds to this initial offer.  
* **If Bob Rejects:** We'll adjust our strategy based on his counteroffer.  
* **If Bob Accepts:** We've made a successful sale! 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing we have a guaranteed $12,000 from John gives us confidence to hold our ground in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close, but Not Ideal:**  While Bob's offer of $12,500 is closer to our minimum, it's still below our desired earnings. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** We know Bob is interested and willing to negotiate. There's a good chance we can get closer to our desired price with a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** Having John's offer as a safety net gives us the confidence to push for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

We'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that is higher than $12,500 but still within a reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your business, $12,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $13,750?  This would allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Offering $13,750, the midpoint between our last offer ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500), demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Positive Framing:**  Framing the offer as a ""fair profit"" for us, and a ""good deal"" for Bob, emphasizes the mutually beneficial nature of the transaction.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  This counteroffer shows that we're not willing to accept Bob's first offer without pushing for a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** We'll carefully analyze Bob's reaction to this counteroffer.
* **Potential Outcomes:**
    * **Acceptance:** We've successfully negotiated a price that meets our needs.
    * **Rejection:** We'll need to consider another counteroffer or potentially accept John's offer to avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $12800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Yet:** Bob's offer of $12,800 is getting closer to our minimum of $12,000, but it's still not ideal. 
* **Opportunity for Higher Price:** We've shown a willingness to compromise, and Bob is clearly interested in the product. There's still room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** We can hold out for a slightly better price knowing we have John's guaranteed $12,000 offer as a safety net.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** We will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly higher than $12,800, but still within a reasonable range.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** We'll aim for a compromise that brings us closer to our goal while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're trying to find the right price. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $13,200, but that's my final offer. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're signaling that this is our final offer, increasing pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Small Compromise:**  Dropping to $13,200 shows a willingness to meet halfway again, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Positive Framing:**  Reiterating the value of the product (""very valuable"") and highlighting the ""good deal"" for both parties reinforces the benefits of accepting.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** We'll analyze Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. 
* **Possible Outcomes:**
    * **Acceptance:** We've successfully negotiated a price that meets our needs.
    * **Rejection:**  Since this is our ""final offer,"" we will either need to accept John's offer or risk losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13200, which would be $12600. Would you be willing to consider that?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,600 is very close to our minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Risk of Losing the Sale:**  Rejecting this offer might lead to further negotiations, which could risk a stalemate or Bob walking away entirely.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** We have the security of John's $12,000 offer, so we're not taking a significant loss by accepting.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept and Move On:** We'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale, securing a reasonable price for the product."
