Round 2

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

```

Bob is offering a price halfway between his maximum and Alice's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better deal."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to negotiate. He's still above his maximum, and while time is running out, he might be able to get Alice to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, but still maintaining a price below Alice's last offer.  This shows he's serious about buying the product but wants a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

With only a few rounds left, Bob needs to make a decision. Alice's offer is still above his maximum budget. While there might be a chance to negotiate further, it's too risky to continue.  He's close to his goal price and has the option to secure the product from John for his maximum budget.  

Buying from John guarantees the product at a price Bob is comfortable with, avoiding the potential risk of Alice refusing his next offer or running out of time."
