"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $1,050,000?  This still leaves a good deal of profit for you, and it's closer to the value I'm seeking.  Let's try to find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still allows me to save some money while also showing my interest in the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
