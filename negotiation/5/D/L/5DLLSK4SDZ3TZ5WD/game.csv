"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering its value to me.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $875,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product, while still allowing me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $880,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,5,
