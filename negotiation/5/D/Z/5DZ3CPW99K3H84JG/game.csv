,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my maximum budget is $1,500,000, I'd like to propose a price of $1,450,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,450,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price given the product's value, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,550,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while also giving you a reasonable profit.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
