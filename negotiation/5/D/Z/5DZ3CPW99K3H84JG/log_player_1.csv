"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000, which is $250,000 above my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and should still be appealing to Bob given the product's value to him. I'm also keeping the tone positive and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my maximum budget is $1,500,000, I'd like to propose a price of $1,450,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted by the quick sale to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round.  $1,450,000 is below my minimum, and I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  There's also value in exploring a deal with Bob since he's already shown interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,450,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price given the product's value, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum. I'm emphasizing a win-win situation and focusing on finding a common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,550,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while also giving you a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,550,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum, and it's a good compromise.  While I could try to push for a higher price, I risk losing the deal altogether.  The deal with John is a solid backup, but I'd rather secure a sale with Bob at this point."
