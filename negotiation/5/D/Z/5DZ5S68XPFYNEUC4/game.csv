"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price is still a fair value considering the potential benefit to my business, and it gives us both a good margin.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business,  $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it's the best I can offer at this time.",950000.0,Alice,3,
