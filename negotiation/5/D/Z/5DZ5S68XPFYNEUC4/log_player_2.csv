"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm offering it to you at $1,000,000. This price is a fair reflection of its value and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,000,000 vs. $800,000).** This means there's room for negotiation and a potential to get a better deal.
* **Buying from John for $1,200,000 is more expensive than Alice's current offer.**  This makes John's offer a less desirable option at this point. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price is still a fair value considering the potential benefit to my business, and it gives us both a good margin."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business,  $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it's the best I can offer at this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $950,000, which is still below your maximum budget of $1,200,000.**  
* **You've already negotiated down from $1,000,000 to $950,000.** Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk is that Alice could walk away or counter with a price closer to your maximum.
* **Buying from John for $1,200,000 is more expensive than Alice's current offer.**

Considering the potential risk and the fact that Alice's offer is within your budget, accepting her offer is the most logical choice at this point."
