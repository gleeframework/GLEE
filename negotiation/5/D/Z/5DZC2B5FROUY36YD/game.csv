"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,500? It's a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
