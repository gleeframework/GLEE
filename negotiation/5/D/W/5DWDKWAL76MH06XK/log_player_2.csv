"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it from me for $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. You have a backup option with John at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation."
