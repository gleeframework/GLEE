"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $88 for it. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is steadily increasing his offer and is now at $88. While we could try to push for a bit more, the difference is getting smaller. Accepting $88 guarantees a profit above our minimum ($80) and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling."
