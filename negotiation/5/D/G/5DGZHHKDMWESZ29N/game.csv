"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while still being a fair deal for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $15,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $12,500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
