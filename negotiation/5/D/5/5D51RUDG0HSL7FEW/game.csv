"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about $130?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $130, which would be $145. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
