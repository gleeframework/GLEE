"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
