Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is a fair price for me, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
