"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is a fair price for me, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than this.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000? This price is still a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you place on the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
