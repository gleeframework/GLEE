Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $950,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still achieve a good profit.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, aiming to make him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I invite Bob to discuss the price, suggesting flexibility and willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping the negotiation open for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that undervalues the product and leaves me with a lower profit than selling to John. 

I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good value for you considering the product's worth.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $950,000 to $850,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit.
* **Open to further discussion:** I explicitly invite Bob to find a compromise, maintaining the negotiation process.

By offering a reasonable counter-offer, I'm aiming to secure a deal that is closer to my desired price while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a ways off from that number. How about $750,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sacrifice my minimum profit margin.  

Given that John is willing to pay $800,000 for the product, it's in my best interest to sell to him and ensure I receive a fair price for the product."
