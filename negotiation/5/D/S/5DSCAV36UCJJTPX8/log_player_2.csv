"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you are still overpaying for the product. You can get the product for $120 from John, which is the maximum you are willing to pay. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to stick to your budget."
