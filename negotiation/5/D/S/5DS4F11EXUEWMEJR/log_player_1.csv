Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $180 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 180}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** You know you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, so you don't want to go lower than that.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $150 to Bob, so starting higher allows room for negotiation if he tries to haggle. 
* **Potential Profit:** Offering it at $180 gives you a potential profit of $30 over your guaranteed sale.
* **Leaving Room:** If Bob rejects the $180 offer, you can always come down a little in a counter-offer, knowing your absolute bottom line is $150."
