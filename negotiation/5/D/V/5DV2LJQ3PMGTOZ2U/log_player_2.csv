# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?

$20,000 is way over my budget. I'll reject and see if we can come to a better agreement."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $12,000 is significantly below my bottom line for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $16,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 14000}
