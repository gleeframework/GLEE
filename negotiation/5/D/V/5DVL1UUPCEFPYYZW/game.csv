"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I have to consider the value I've placed on this product, and $950000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm counteroffering at $1025000.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
