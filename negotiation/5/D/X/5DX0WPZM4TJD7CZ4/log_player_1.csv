Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Be positive:** I emphasize the value the product has for Bob, making him more likely to engage.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** By starting at $10,000, I have room to negotiate down without dropping below my minimum.  
* **John as a safety net:** If Bob rejects my offer, I have John as a backup, which gives me the confidence to be firm in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a step in the right direction, $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm willing to negotiate further to potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.  
* **John's offer provides leverage:** Knowing I have John's offer for $12,000 gives me the confidence to be firm in my counteroffers.

I'll counter with a higher offer, aiming to get closer to my minimum price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high to go that low. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? It's a good compromise that I believe is fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  My counteroffer of $9,500 is a move towards Bob's offer but still well above my minimum.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still emphasizing my position.
* **Focus on fairness:** I highlight that my counteroffer is a ""good compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** $9,500 allows for potential adjustments depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000? I'm trying to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for future negotiation:** Even though $9,000 isn't ideal, it's a good starting point for future negotiation if I need to sell the product.
* **Risk of losing John:** If I keep rejecting offers, there's a chance John might change his mind or find another seller.
* **Time is money:**  Prolonging the negotiations could mean losing more money in the long run.

While $9,000 isn't the best outcome, it's a reasonable compromise that allows me to secure a sale and potentially negotiate further for a higher price in the future."
