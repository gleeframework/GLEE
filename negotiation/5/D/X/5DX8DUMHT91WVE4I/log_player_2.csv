"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's significantly closer to your maximum budget than her estimated value.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  While it's an option, it's not the most desirable since it would cost you the most."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This initial counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming to establish a starting point for negotiations. 
* **Value-Based:** The price is still above Alice's estimated value, making it potentially acceptable for her. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  This initial offer leaves room for multiple rounds of negotiation, allowing for a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still closer to your maximum budget than her estimated value. 
* **More negotiation is possible.**  There's still a significant gap between her offer and your ideal price, suggesting there's room for more negotiation.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** It's still the least desirable option as it costs the most."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Increase:** This counteroffer increases the price slightly from the previous round, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Bridging the Gap:** The offer is still below Alice's latest price, aiming to move closer to a potential agreement. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further and potentially find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Compromise:** Alice's offer is now closer to your ideal price range, and a further round of negotiation might not result in a significantly lower price.
* **Time is a factor:** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to reject offers and risk reaching the final round with no deal. 
* **Avoiding John's offer:** Accepting Alice's offer is still significantly less expensive than buying from John.

While you could potentially continue negotiating and potentially save a bit more, accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product within your budget and before you have to resort to John's offer."
