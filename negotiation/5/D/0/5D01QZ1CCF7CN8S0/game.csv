"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $115.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110? ",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go back to my original offer of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $117.50.",117.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $117.5 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $113.75? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",113.75,Bob,6,
