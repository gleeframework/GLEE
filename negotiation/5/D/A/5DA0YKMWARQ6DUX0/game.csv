"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $82.50?",82.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $82.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $86.25? This is a great product and I think it's worth it!",86.25,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $86.25 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I'm looking for a better deal. How about we meet at $82.50, like I suggested before, or even lower, $80.50?",80.5,Bob,4,
