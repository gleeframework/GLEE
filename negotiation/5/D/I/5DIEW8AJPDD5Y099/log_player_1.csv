I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be interested and we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can potentially get more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully a price we can both agree on.  It's still higher than my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, and it's within a range I'm comfortable with. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
