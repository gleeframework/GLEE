Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I know Bob values the product at $100, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit than selling to John for $100.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $150 offer isn't excessively high, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if he finds it slightly steep. This opens the door to finding a mutually agreeable price above my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have a secure fallback option with John, ensuring I won't make a loss."
