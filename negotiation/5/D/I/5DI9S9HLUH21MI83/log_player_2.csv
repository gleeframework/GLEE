"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's not just an item; it's an investment in enhancing your lifestyle or business significantly. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. I am offering the product to you for $9,500, which is a fair price considering its worth and your potential benefit. Let's discuss this further to see if we can reach a satisfactory arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,500.** This is higher than Alice's value for the product ($8,000) but still less than your maximum willingness to pay ($10,000).
* **John's offer is $10,000.** This is your maximum price.
* **It's better to reject Alice's offer.** Even though you'd save some money by accepting her offer, you can still get a better deal from John."
