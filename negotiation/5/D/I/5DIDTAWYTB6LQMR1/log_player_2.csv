"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering. While $1,400,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than Alice's desired selling price. There's room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a bold move, but it leaves room for further negotiation. This counteroffer is still within Alice's desired selling range, making it a reasonable starting point for a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's within his budget and significantly lower than John's price. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might become unwilling to sell or counter with a higher price. Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids potential complications."
