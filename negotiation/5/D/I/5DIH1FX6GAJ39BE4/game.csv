"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $12000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13500. It's a great compromise, if I do say so myself!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice! However, $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12800. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",12800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $12800. I'm willing to take it down to $13200, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",13200.0,Alice,5,
