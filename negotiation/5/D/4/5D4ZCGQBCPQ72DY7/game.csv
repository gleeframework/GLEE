Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.,800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $800000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $750000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $750000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $680000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",680000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $680000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $725000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $725000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $690000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price.",690000.0,Bob,6,
