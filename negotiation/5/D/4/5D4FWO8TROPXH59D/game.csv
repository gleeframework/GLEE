"Hi Bob, I understand that $14000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $8000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $10000.
