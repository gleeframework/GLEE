{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice.  $80 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $70. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and shows I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$75 is closer to my goal, but I can still try to get a lower price. I'll reject and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 72}
``` 

I'm going to offer $72. This is a small reduction from Alice's last offer, but it shows that I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm also hoping that Alice might be more motivated to close the deal at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $73. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $73
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $73, which is a good price considering my maximum budget is $100.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal.  There's always a risk of getting a lower price by continuing to negotiate, but I'm happy with this outcome."
