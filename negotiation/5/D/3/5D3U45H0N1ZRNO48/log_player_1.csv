Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider this price?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000, which is a fair compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product to you while allowing me to get closer to my desired outcome. Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 890000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not the price I was initially hoping for, it's getting closer to my minimum and it's the best offer I've received so far.  It's also getting late in the negotiation process, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
