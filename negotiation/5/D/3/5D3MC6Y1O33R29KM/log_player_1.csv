Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You are aware that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($400,000) while still leaving Bob with a potential gain of $100,000. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. You are not pressured to accept anything less than that amount. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
