"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still looking to make a good profit. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise again, though. How about we meet at $125?
