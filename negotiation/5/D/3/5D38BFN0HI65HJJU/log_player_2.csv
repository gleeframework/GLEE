"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to an agreement. I am willing to offer this exceptional product to you for $10,000. I hope this price aligns with your expectations and needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I have room to negotiate and try to get a lower price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, that price point is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Respectful:** My message is courteous and acknowledges the value of the product. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to get as close to $8,000 as possible, ideally even lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. I am willing to consider $7,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope it meets within your budget while still providing a fair return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but I'm still aiming lower. Since I have a backup option with John, I'm willing to push the negotiation a bit further. I'm hoping to land somewhere between $6,000 and $7,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $7,500 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $6,750?"", 
""product_price"": 6750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($6,000) and Alice's latest offer ($7,500). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** I'm curious to see how Alice responds to a counteroffer in this range. It will give me a better sense of her bottom line.
* **Backup Plan:** I still have the option to go with John for $8,000 if needed, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept a price I'm not comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $7,250 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Limit:** Alice has come down considerably, and $7,250 is a reasonable price for the product. It's below my $8,000 fallback option with John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but there's also a risk Alice could walk away. The potential savings aren't worth the risk at this point.
* **Time is a Factor:** We've already used up half of the negotiation rounds. Accepting now secures the deal."
