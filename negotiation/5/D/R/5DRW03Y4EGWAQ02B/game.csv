"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $175? That's a fair price for both of us.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125. Let's try to meet in the middle.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but $125 is still too far below what I need. How about $160? Let's try to close this deal.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $125. Let's split the difference and go with $142.50. This seems like a fair compromise, don't you think?",142.5,Bob,6,
