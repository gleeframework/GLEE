"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $950,000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, recognizing the potential value this product holds for you. This is a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal now.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $850,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to propose $750,000 as a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium, but I need to be confident in the value I'm getting.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $750,000 is still below my minimum. I'm confident in this product's value and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a price closer to $800,000. Let's try $780,000. This is a fair compromise and ensures both of us get a good deal.  What do you say?",780000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $780,000. I'd like to propose $720,000 as a more reasonable price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel confident in the value I'm getting.",720000.0,Bob,6,
