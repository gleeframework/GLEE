# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,600,000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm interested, but I'd need to see a price closer to the $600,000 range for it to make sense for me. What could you do for me at that level?

While $1,600,000 represents a fair value, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
