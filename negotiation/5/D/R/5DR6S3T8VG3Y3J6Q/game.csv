"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this product. I've set the initial price at $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the value it offers. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,600,000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm interested, but I'd need to see a price closer to the $600,000 range for it to make sense for me. What could you do for me at that level?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,600,000 represents a fair value, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This considers the product's true worth while recognizing your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said, $1,100,000 is still quite a leap from what I had in mind. To be candid, I'm considering another option closer to $700,000. Could you meet me somewhere near that mark?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $700,000 is below the value of what I'm offering. Let's settle at $950,000.  This price reflects the significant value you're getting while acknowledging the need to find a compromise.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this.  I'm definitely getting closer, but $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. To be completely transparent, I need to keep this purchase under $800,000. If you can find a way to make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
