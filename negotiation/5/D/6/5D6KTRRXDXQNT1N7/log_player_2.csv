"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a price of $13,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $10,000 is a bold move, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially a compromise that benefits both parties. It's likely Alice will counter, giving Bob another chance to refine his offer and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite high.  Could we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer of $13,000 and significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.  Bob can save $1,500 by accepting Alice's offer,  making it the most financially sensible choice at this point."
