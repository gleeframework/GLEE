{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows for some profit on my end.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original price.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $13,500 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $13,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to $14,000, $13,000 is still a good price for me, especially since I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's also a good compromise with Bob, and it secures a deal."
