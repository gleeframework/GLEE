"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $25000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $18000 for it.  What do you think?",18000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking $22000 could be a sweet spot for both of us. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $20000?",20000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this, and $20000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $21500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",21500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I can do $21500, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. Can you meet me at $21500, or is there a different price you're thinking of?",21500.0,Alice,7,
