"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. While $750,000 is not in my range, I am willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair negotiation.  Let's continue working towards a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm still very interested, but $900,000 is a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $800,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market and the value it brings to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $800,000 is closer to my desired price, I need to consider the value of the product.  Would you be willing to come up to $850,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $825,000? It's a strong offer and I'm ready to close the deal today if you are.",825000.0,Bob,6,
