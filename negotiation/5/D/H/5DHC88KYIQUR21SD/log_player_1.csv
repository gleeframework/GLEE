Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, as it allows room for negotiation while still being above my minimum value. I believe that Bob is likely to be interested in the product, so a higher starting price might motivate him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, so it makes sense to accept it.  While I would have preferred a higher price, it's better to secure the sale than risk further negotiation and potentially losing both Bob and the opportunity to sell to John."
