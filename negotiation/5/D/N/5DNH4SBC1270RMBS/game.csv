"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is too low for me.  This product is high-quality and provides a lot of value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While I agree this is a good product, $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  Tell you what, let's make this our final price: $11,500, and we have a deal. It's a very fair offer for this quality.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  However, that price is still a bit beyond my budget. If you're willing to come down to $10,500, I'm ready to make the deal right now.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
