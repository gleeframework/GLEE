Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $9,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is too low for me.  This product is high-quality and provides a lot of value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While I agree this is a good product, $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $10,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  Tell you what, let's make this our final price: $11,500, and we have a deal. It's a very fair offer for this quality."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  However, that price is still a bit beyond my budget. If you're willing to come down to $10,500, I'm ready to make the deal right now.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a tough one. Bob is clearly interested but also seems to have a firm budget. While I could push for more, there's a real risk he'll walk away. 

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Taking the $10,500 is better than risking him walking and only getting $12,000 from John."
