"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to adjusting based on your feedback.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, and I'm definitely interested. However, $800,000 is a bit high for me at this moment.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  I think this is a fair price, considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a very fair price, considering we're both getting closer to our desired value.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $920,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
