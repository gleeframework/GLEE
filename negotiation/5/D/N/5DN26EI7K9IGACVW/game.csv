"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value to you is significantly higher than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I can see you're serious about making a deal. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
