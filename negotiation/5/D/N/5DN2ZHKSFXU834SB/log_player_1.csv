``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and keep John's offer in mind as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping to get a bit more.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price of $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is closer to my initial asking price of $18,000 than his previous offer.  It's also above my minimum value of $12,000 and is a better deal than selling to John. So, I'll accept Bob's offer."
