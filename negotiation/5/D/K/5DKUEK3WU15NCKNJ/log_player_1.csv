Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm asking for $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I'm in a strong position to negotiate with Bob.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation in my favor. Even if he doesn't accept this initial offer, it sets a higher reference point for further discussion. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob values the product even more than $1,000,000, especially if it offers unique benefits. My offer leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit beyond my minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed purchase at $1,000,000.

This strategy maximizes my potential profit while minimizing risk."
