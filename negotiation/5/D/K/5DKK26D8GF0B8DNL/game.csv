"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that work for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to my target, but $950,000 is still a bit short. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to meet my minimum of $1,050,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Can we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
