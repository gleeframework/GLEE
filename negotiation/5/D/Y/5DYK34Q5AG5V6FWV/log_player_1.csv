Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. How about we meet at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $9,800. It's not worth risking the sure $10,000 from John for a slightly higher potential profit from Bob."
