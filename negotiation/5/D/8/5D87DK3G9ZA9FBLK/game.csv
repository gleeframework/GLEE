"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the benefits of owning this product.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about $10,400?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,400. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $10,600. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10600.0,Alice,5,
