Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning a public listing implies Bob might miss out if he doesn't act, potentially making him more agreeable. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have a way to credibly convey the value of the product to Bob. If Bob has no reason to believe the product is worth more than $8,000 to him, he's unlikely to accept a price that high."
