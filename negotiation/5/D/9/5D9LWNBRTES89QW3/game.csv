"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $75 is too low for me.  Could you do $100?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $100 is still a little out of my price range. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",90.0,Bob,4,
