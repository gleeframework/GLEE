Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $125. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer allows for some potential profit for you, while also being attractive enough to Bob that he might accept it. It leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. However, if he rejects, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $150."
