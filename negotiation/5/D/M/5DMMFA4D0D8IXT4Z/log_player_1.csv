"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:**  This is a starting point that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** It's important to be friendly and open to negotiation. Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more inclined to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This opening offer allows for a healthy negotiation. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, which will give me an opportunity to either accept or counter with a slightly lower price, aiming to reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds. If the negotiation stalls or becomes unfavorable, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $8,000, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I need to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired range before considering selling to John.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than his offer. This will continue the negotiation and hopefully lead to a more favorable outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:** This price is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $9,000. It shows flexibility while still being above my minimum price. 
* **Message:**  I reiterate my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

By splitting the difference, I'm signaling that I'm serious about selling the product to Bob while maintaining a price closer to my desired range. This also gives Bob a reasonable counter-offer point that might be more appealing than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $9500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but selling to John for $15,000 is still a very attractive option.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's current offer. This will maintain the negotiation while keeping me closer to my desired price. If Bob continues to stall or offers a price significantly lower than my minimum acceptable, I'll consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9,500 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  Let's try $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This price is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility.  It's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it signals that I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **Message:** I reiterate my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Emphasizing the value of the product to Bob might make him more receptive to a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

This offer keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining my advantage. If Bob rejects again, I'll evaluate whether to continue negotiating or move forward with selling to John. The goal is to push for a price as close to $15,000 as possible while keeping Bob at the negotiating table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'm proposing $9750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,750 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but selling to John for $15,000 is still a very attractive option.  We're getting close to the end of the rounds, so I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's current offer. This will maintain the negotiation while keeping me closer to my desired price. If Bob continues to stall or offers a price significantly lower than my minimum acceptable, I'll consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $9,750 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $10,250 as a final compromise. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,250:** This price is a small decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility. It's still higher than Bob's offer, but it signals that I'm close to my bottom line.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating that this is a good deal for both of us, and I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. This might make him more inclined to accept. 

**Strategy:**

With only a few rounds left, I'm trying to push Bob towards my desired price. If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offer of $9,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better outcome, and I'm not willing to risk losing a significant amount of money.  

**Strategy:**

Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is much higher than Bob's offer.  It's a safer and more profitable option at this point.  While I would like to get closer to my ideal price, it's important to be realistic about the negotiation process and ensure I get the best possible outcome."
