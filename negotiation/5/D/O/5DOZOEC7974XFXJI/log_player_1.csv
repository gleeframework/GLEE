Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to earn at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price between $80 and $150 allows for profit.  A price closer to $150 maximizes potential earnings.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.

This strategy aims to secure a price that's significantly profitable while still being appealing to Bob."
