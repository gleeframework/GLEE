Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum price of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $95. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $105, which is still a good compromise. I think you'll really appreciate the product, and this price is a fair reflection of its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above your maximum price of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially since you have several rounds left. While buying from John for $100 is a good option, there's a chance you could get a better deal with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $105 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
