{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $9,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming higher with Bob could net you an extra profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $9,500 is attractive to Bob (as it's more than his perceived value) while still leaving you a good margin.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer before reconsidering. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly higher than $9,500 to leave room for bargaining. 
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower offer to ensure a positive experience."
