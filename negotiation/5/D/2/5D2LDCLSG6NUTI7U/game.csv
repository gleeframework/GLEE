"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider selling the product to me for $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about we settle on $950,000?  This price would still give you a significant profit, and it would allow me to get closer to my target. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think we can do better. Would you consider selling the product to me for $920,000?",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $930,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and the potential it holds for your business.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal in the next few rounds.",930000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $930,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $930,000. Would you consider selling the product to me for $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,6,
