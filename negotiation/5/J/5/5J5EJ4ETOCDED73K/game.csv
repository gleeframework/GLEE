"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1400000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1600000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a bit more than $1550000. I'm counteroffering at $1650000. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a bit more than $1550000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1580000, but that's the highest I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1580000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1580000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1680000. What do you think?",1680000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1620000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1620000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1620000, Bob, but I'm still not getting close enough to my target. I'm going to have to think about whether it's worth continuing to negotiate with you, but I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1700000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid $1700000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but I'm not going any higher. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider other options.",1600000.0,Bob,10,
