"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $13,000.  This product is very valuable and I know it's worth a good amount to the right buyer. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a little lower. How about $13,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to move forward.",13250.0,Bob,4,
