"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially even exceeding $1200000.  While I can't disclose specifics, I'm confident this product aligns with your interests. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a substantial price, but it reflects the potential value I see in it. Consider it a chance to invest in something truly unique. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is asking for $1,500,000, which is more than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You can get the same product from John for a much lower price. It's always better to save money if possible."
