"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $130, and that's my final offer. If I don't get it, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",130.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already gone quite far in compromising, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $134. It's a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. If not, I'll consider selling it to John for $120.",134.0,Alice,7,
