"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $110.  Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, he might be willing to negotiate down from this price.  However, I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, I think I can still push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be enough to get a deal done without jeopardizing the potential sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $92 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $100. I'll counter with a lower offer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100.  This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that Bob will accept it.  If he doesn't, I can always sell to John for the same price."
