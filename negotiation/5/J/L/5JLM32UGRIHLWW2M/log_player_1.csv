Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product. I think it would be very valuable for you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start with a higher asking price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price you're happy with.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will tell me a lot about how badly he wants the product and how much he's willing to pay. 
* **Fallback Option:** Remember, I always have John as a fallback option who will pay $8,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,000 is below both my minimum ($8,000) and his own perceived value ($8,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I believe the product is worth more and open the door for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $7,000 is significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I could meet you halfway at $8,500. This seems like a fair price considering its value to both of us."",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $8,500, I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating that the product has value for both of us, subtly reminding Bob of his own $8,000 valuation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm moving closer to Bob's price, I'm still above John's offer, preserving my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but he's still significantly below my minimum of $8,000. It seems unlikely he'll reach my desired price point. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $8,000."
