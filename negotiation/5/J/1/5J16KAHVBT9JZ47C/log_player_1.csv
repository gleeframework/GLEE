``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still getting me a substantial profit. I'm confident Bob will see the value in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $12,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a compromise, as I'm willing to go down from my initial offer, but still maintain a decent profit. I believe this price is fair and will be more attractive to Bob than his previous offer."
