"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $14,000.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Alice's value of the product. This leaves room for further negotiation while also showing Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still within Bob's budget and a better price than what John is offering. It's also likely that Alice will not go lower, considering her value of the product is $10,000.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
