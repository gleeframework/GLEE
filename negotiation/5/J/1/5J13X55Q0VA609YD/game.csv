"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this product at a great price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for the product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to come down another $500 from my previous offer, and I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm ready to close the deal today, but I need the price to be right.  Would you consider $12,000?  That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'll make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,7,
