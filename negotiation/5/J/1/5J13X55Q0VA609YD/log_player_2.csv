"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this product at a great price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for the product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often involve starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite but makes it clear that $18,000 is unacceptable.
* **Target in Mind:** While the offer is $10,000, your goal is to get the price as close to $12,000 (your walk-away point) as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, which is good, but $14,000 is still above both your target price and John's offer. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer moves closer to the middle ground between your initial offer and Alice's counteroffer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $11,500 is a strong offer because:
    * It's below your $12,000 walk-away point.
    * It gives you some bargaining room if Alice rejects it.
* **Justifying the Price:**  You're reiterating that you find value in the product but need a price that works for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to come down another $500 from my previous offer, and I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close!  While Alice is coming down in smaller increments, $13,500 is still above your $12,000 walk-away point with John. There's a chance to negotiate a bit further, but we need to be prepared to walk away and take John's deal if Alice won't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm ready to close the deal today, but I need the price to be right.  Would you consider $12,000?  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer firmly establishes your absolute limit ($12,000) while still leaving Alice an opportunity to make a small profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Letting Alice know you're ready to ""close the deal today"" adds a bit of pressure and signals you're serious. 
* **Walk-Away Preparedness:** If Alice rejects this offer, you're prepared to walk away and buy from John at your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'll make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $13,000 and has called it her final offer.  You've reached your walk-away point. It's time to exercise your option to buy from John for $12,000 and avoid potentially overpaying."
