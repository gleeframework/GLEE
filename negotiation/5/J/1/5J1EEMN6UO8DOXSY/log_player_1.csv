"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,500, which is a significant amount but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, making it clear that it's a good deal for him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, but I'm setting a clear starting point. 
* **Safety Net:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still $1,000 below what I'd prefer. 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm going to push for a higher price. There are still 8 rounds, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired range.
* **Safety Net:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not under immense pressure to accept Bob's offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to show you my commitment to making this deal happen. This price still reflects the significant value this product brings to you.  Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer, but not significantly. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of its worth and why a slightly higher price is justified. 
* **Motivating Language:** I'm using language like ""commitment to making this deal happen"" and ""find common ground"" to show that I'm invested in reaching an agreement.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $12,000 is still above my minimum of $10,000, so I'm not risking a significantly lower profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $12,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. How about $11,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:**  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still $500 below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm committed to getting as close to $12,000 as possible. There's still time to push for a slightly higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could sell to John for $10,000, I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob. There are more rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $11,750. This price acknowledges your budget while still giving me a fair return. I'm ready to close the deal at this price, so let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Positive Language:**  I use phrases like ""meet you halfway"" and ""ready to close the deal"" to express my willingness to make this happen.
* **Closing Strategy:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting that I'm ready to close the deal at this price, putting the ball back in Bob's court.
* **Acceptable Profit:**  $11,750 is still above my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely close to Bob's maximum, increasing the chances of a deal in this round."
