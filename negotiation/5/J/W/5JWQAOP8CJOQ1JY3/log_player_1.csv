Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further"" signals willingness to negotiate, potentially leading to a price higher than John's offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging that Bob might try to negotiate a lower price."
