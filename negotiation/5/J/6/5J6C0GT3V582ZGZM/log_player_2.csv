"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $90. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  While $90 is better than $100, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $85? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $87.50 is still within your budget of $100, and it's a good compromise.  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings.  It's a fair price that ensures you get the product without overspending."
