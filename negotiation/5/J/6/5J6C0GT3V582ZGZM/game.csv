"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",87.5,Alice,3,
