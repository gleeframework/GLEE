Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. 

Here's why:

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Alice has shown a reluctance to budge significantly from her price point.
* **Limited Rounds:** There are only a few rounds remaining, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down to Bob's desired price.
* **Guaranteed Price:** John offers a price that's within Bob's budget, providing a sure deal without further negotiation risk. 

It's better for Bob to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with rather than risk further negotiation that may not yield a better result."
