Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a good starting point:

* **Fairly High Price:** $12,000 is a significant amount but still leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob a reason to engage.
* **Positive Message:**  The message is friendly and highlights potential value for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Leaves room for counteroffers:** This is a strategic move to potentially get a better price while giving Bob the feeling of being part of the process. 

Let's see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for you:** $9,500 is above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it's still far below the product's worth to Bob ($15,000). 
* **Potential for better price:** We can likely get closer to Bob's true value by continuing negotiation. 
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  John's offer provides a safety net if we fail to reach an agreement with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

We'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would give you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  This counteroffer is a compromise - closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Positive Message:** The message remains positive, showing willingness to negotiate and emphasizing the potential value for Bob.
* **Strategic Goal:**  This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to our desired price point while maintaining a positive negotiation atmosphere. 

Let's see if this counteroffer is successful in securing a better price!"
