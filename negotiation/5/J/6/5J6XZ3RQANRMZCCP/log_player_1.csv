Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Since we know the product is worth $150 to Bob, starting at $140 is likely to pique his interest as it's a good deal for him. 
* **Above John's Offer:**  The offer is significantly higher than John's $100 offer, ensuring that even with negotiation, we are likely to earn more than our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a reasonable profit, we started high for a reason. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to negotiate.  We should counter to see if we can reach a price closer to our initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $130?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our initial offer ($140) and Bob's counteroffer ($120). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Maintaining Profitability:** $130 is still a significant profit margin above our minimum acceptable price of $100 and well above John's standing offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $125 is a good profit, exceeding our minimum by $25 and comfortably above John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gain is unlikely to be significant.  Each round increases the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now brings in the money faster.  Time spent in protracted negotiations could be used pursuing other deals."
