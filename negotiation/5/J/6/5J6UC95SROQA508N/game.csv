"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
