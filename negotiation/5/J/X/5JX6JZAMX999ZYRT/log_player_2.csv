# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.

# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000, as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value to me and the value you place on it.
