"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a profit, so I'm starting with a price that reflects its worth to me.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $1,000,000 is outside my budget. Given the value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal that benefits both of us. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me and the value you place on it. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. This price is fair considering the value to me and your desire to sell. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000, as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value to me and the value you place on it. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true worth.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to my range, I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can finalize this deal and move forward.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $875,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach a deal. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair price, considering the value to me and the value you place on it. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true worth.",925000.0,Alice,7,
