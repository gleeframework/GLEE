"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $135, it makes sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $130? That's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $130 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  You can try to negotiate further to see if Alice will budge."
