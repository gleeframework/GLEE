"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find very interesting. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price of $2000000. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $2000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it,  which reflects the value I see and allows for a fair margin for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1200000. Considering the value of the product and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1800000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1400000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're willing to go up to $1400000. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1550000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise. What are your thoughts?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1450000.  This is a significant move on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  I believe this is a great opportunity to finalize the deal and avoid any further negotiation.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
