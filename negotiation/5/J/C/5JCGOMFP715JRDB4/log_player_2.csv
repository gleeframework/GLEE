As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below your target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $790,000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can see the value in this compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has made it clear she's unwilling to go below $800,000. This offer of $790,000 is a good compromise, saving you $210,000 compared to John's offer and $10,000 compared to Alice's likely minimum.  Continuing to negotiate has a low chance of yielding a significantly better outcome."
