"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $115? That's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about $105? I think that's a fair compromise.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - $110. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",110.0,Alice,5,
