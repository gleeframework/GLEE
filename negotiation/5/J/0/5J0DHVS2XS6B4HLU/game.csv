"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $900,000. I would like to propose an alternative. How about we aim for a price closer to $850,000? This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my financial limits.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still below what I can reasonably accept.  Considering the value of this product and the potential benefits it offers, I believe a price of $875,000 would be more fair to both of us. This leaves you room for a good profit while ensuring I get a return that aligns with my investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still looking for a more balanced solution. Given the current market conditions and my budgetary constraints, I believe a price closer to $825,000 would be more appropriate. This still provides a decent profit margin for you while staying within my financial limits. I hope we can find common ground.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I've carefully considered your offer, and I'm willing to make a final concession.  Given the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations, I'm proposing a price of $860,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to move forward with another buyer. Let me know your decision.",860000.0,Alice,5,
