"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1800000.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints,  $1800000 is still below the value I've placed on this product. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1900000.  This price still leaves room for a healthy profit for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $1750000 is simply too low. It's important to remember the unique value and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a final price of $1850000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's close this deal!",1850000.0,Alice,5,
