"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects its worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant difference from what I had in mind. To move things forward, I'd be willing to accept $1,350,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,320,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
