"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is just not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still represents a significant value for you. This product is a game-changer, and I believe it will be worth every penny for your business. Let's close this deal and get you on track for success.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I'm still looking to keep my expenses lower. Could we possibly agree on $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'm open to finding a middle ground, $14,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've invested in this.  I'm willing to compromise and accept $14,500.  This will ensure you get a fantastic product at a price that's still very competitive.  Let's seal this deal before we run out of time.",14500.0,Alice,5,
