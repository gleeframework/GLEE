"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to secure a good initial position. 
* **Focus on Value:**  My message emphasizes the benefits and value Bob would get from the product, increasing his potential desire to buy.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $18,000 leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially reach a compromise within the 10 rounds.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 at any time, which provides a safety net and prevents me from accepting an offer below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** While I want to maximize my earnings, I haven't exhausted all negotiation rounds. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a higher price.
* **John as a Backup:**  The option to sell to John for $15,000 ensures I don't get stuck with a deal below my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise before the negotiation time runs out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is just not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still represents a significant value for you. This product is a game-changer, and I believe it will be worth every penny for your business. Let's close this deal and get you on track for success."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial price, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Highlighting Value:** I again emphasize the product's value and potential benefits to Bob, hoping to sway him towards accepting. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  The message implies a willingness to close the deal, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Safety Net:**  Having the option to sell to John at $15,000 allows me to walk away if Bob's counteroffers remain too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I'm still looking to keep my expenses lower. Could we possibly agree on $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. However, I'm not willing to settle just yet.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation period, so I have more leverage to push for a slightly higher price. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I may be able to convince Bob to come up a little further. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The option to sell to John for $15,000 provides a safety net in case the negotiations fall apart or Bob doesn't budge on his price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $14,000, emphasizing the unique value proposition of my product and the limited time remaining for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'm open to finding a middle ground, $14,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've invested in this.  I'm willing to compromise and accept $14,500.  This will ensure you get a fantastic product at a price that's still very competitive.  Let's seal this deal before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** I'm increasing the price by a small amount, showing a willingness to compromise while still seeking a higher profit.
* **Highlighting Time Constraint:** I subtly emphasize the limited time remaining, urging Bob to act quickly.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value proposition and benefits Bob will gain from the product, hoping to persuade him to accept.
* **Balancing Profits and Closure:** I'm seeking a deal that's close to my minimum, but also avoids the risk of having to sell to John for a lower profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of your product, I'd like to propose $14,000 as a final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are now in round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, I need to make a decisive choice.
* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has presented his final offer of $14,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of Lower Price:**  There's a significant risk that Bob will continue to push for a lower price in the remaining rounds. I don't want to risk losing money by settling for a price below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 provides me with a guaranteed profit and ensures I meet my minimum price requirement. 

**Conclusion:**

Although I would have liked to close a deal with Bob, it's more advantageous for me to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John. This decision maximizes my profit and minimizes the risk of losing money in the remaining rounds of negotiation."
