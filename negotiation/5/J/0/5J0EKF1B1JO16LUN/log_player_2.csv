"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's initial offer is lower than her valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  It's worth seeing if a counteroffer can get a better price.  There are also 9 rounds remaining to potentially negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Bob wants to save as much as possible. This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.
* **Testing the Waters:** It's important to start with a bold counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to move.  If she rejects, it provides more information for future rounds. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $950,000 is still below Bob's maximum price, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but No Cigar:** Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still higher.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There are still 7 rounds left.  A counteroffer might push Alice closer to Bob's desired price or, at the very least, gather more information for the next round.
* **The Backup Option:** Buying from John for $1,000,000 is still a viable option, but it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to drop her price further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase from another seller for that price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer signals to Alice that Bob is serious about his price point and ready to walk away if necessary.
* **Setting a Deadline:** By mentioning the alternative seller, Bob adds a sense of urgency and reinforces his commitment to his target price.
* **Matching the Alternative:** $1,000,000 is the price Bob can get elsewhere, making it a strong baseline.
* **High Stakes:** This round is crucial. If Alice rejects, Bob will likely move on to the alternative seller."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're close to walking away, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I can offer you a price of $1,030,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:**  Alice's offer is now only $30,000 above Bob's maximum price, making it very attractive.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob can buy from John for $1,000,000, Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and there are still 5 rounds left to potentially get a better deal.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** Bob has already made his ""final offer"" and knows he may not be able to get much lower.  Accepting this offer secures the product while saving a significant amount. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  While there's a chance Alice might come down further, there's also a risk she could reject this offer and Bob would be stuck buying from John at a higher price."
