{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that might be of interest to you. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but not too high to deter him immediately. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. It's becoming clear that we are not going to agree on a price.  It's time to move on and accept the guaranteed offer from John."
