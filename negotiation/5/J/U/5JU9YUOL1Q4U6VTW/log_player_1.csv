Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $200.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a starting point. Here's why:

* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting high gives you room to negotiate down. 
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message invites Bob to respond, potentially with a counteroffer.

**Important Notes:**

* **The $200 offer is just a starting point.** You can adjust it based on your knowledge of the product's market value.
* **Be prepared to negotiate.** Bob might counter, and you'll need to decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer.
* **Don't be afraid to walk away.**  If you feel like the negotiation isn't going anywhere, you can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $120 is significantly below my minimum value of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for that low. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $175? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 meets my minimum price. It's time to accept and close the deal.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee I'd get a better price.  It's better to accept the offer and avoid the risk of losing the sale."
