"I'm interested in the product, but $25,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you countering, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $18,000 is too low for me to consider. Could you do $22,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",22000.0,Alice,3,
