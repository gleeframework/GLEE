Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Mentioning ""fair price"" subtly tries to frame the negotiation as a collaborative process, rather than a pure adversarial one.
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to engage in further discussions. This keeps the negotiation dynamic.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll analyze Bob's response and decide whether to accept a counteroffer, make a counteroffer myself, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's more than what I could get it for elsewhere. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would leave me with a substantial loss.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it does acknowledge the value of the product and suggests a willingness to negotiate. This means there's still potential to reach a more favorable price.
* **Strategic advantage:** Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the advantage of controlling the next move. I can make a counteroffer that is more in line with my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to my desired price, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'll aim for a price that's attractive to Bob but also allows me to earn a substantial profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** My counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:** $1,300,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This ensures I still make a profit.
* **Appeal to reason:** I frame the counteroffer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, appealing to his perceived value of the product.
* **Open to further negotiation:** The message implies that I'm open to further discussion and a potential compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's response:** I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to justify accepting it.
* **Potential for deadlock:**  Bob's statement that his offer is ""final"" suggests a potential for a stalemate.  Further negotiation might not yield a satisfactory result.
* **John offers a secure alternative:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  This is a safer option than risking further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalize the deal with John:** I'll contact John to finalize the sale and secure my desired profit."
