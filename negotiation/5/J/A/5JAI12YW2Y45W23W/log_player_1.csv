Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than my minimum value:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob isn't willing to pay $150, I can still potentially negotiate down to a price that's acceptable to me.
* **It incentivizes Bob to buy:** By offering a higher price, I'm showing Bob that the product is valuable and I'm confident in its worth."
