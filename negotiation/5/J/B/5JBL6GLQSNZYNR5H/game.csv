"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,000,000. I believe this is reflective of its value and the benefits it offers.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $650,000 is a bit too low, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair price that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but  $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're definitely close.  I appreciate you working with me on this. To show you I'm serious about closing the deal, how about $850,000? That's a significant price drop and demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the movement you've made so far.  To be honest, I have another offer for $800,000. To make this work with you, I can't go any higher than that. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,6,
