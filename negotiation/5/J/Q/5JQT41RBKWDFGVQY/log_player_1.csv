Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $12,000.  Offering it slightly below his perceived value ($11,500) gives him a small incentive to buy while still securing a significant profit for you (Alice).
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John who will buy the product for $10,000. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is polite, direct, and highlights the product's value to encourage Bob's acceptance."
