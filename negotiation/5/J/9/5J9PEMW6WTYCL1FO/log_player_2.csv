# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my ideal price. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting this offer allows me to attempt to get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've taken your offer into consideration, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a reasonable compromise from my end.

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I still have time to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows me to potentially secure an even better price. I'm also wary of buying the product for over $1 million because I can buy from John for $1.5 million, which is still within my budget."
