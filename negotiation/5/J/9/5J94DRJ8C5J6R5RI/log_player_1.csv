{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to strike a balance between getting a good price and not pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is the absolute lowest I can go.  This still leaves you a significant amount of value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose $10,000 as a potential compromise. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's still significantly higher than his initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John for $15,000."
