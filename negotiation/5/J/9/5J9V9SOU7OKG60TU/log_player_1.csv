"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm confident that John will be willing to buy for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail, so I have a solid backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is tempting, I believe I can do better. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to $1,000,000, knowing that I can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This is still above Bob's value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully gets us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at $1,000,000, which is exactly what John is offering.  While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price from Bob, and I risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
