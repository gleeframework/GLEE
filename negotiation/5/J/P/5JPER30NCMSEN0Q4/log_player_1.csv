{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $2,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate, but not so high that it immediately turns Bob off.  It also opens the conversation with a clear price and leaves room for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I could sell to John for the same price, I still want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob. He's shown interest, and I think I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product.  To show you I'm serious about a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1625000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,625,000 is a decent price, and it's closer to my minimum value than John's offer. I don't want to risk going back and forth with Bob and potentially losing him altogether. It's time to secure the sale."
