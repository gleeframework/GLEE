"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your desired price range. It's worth negotiating further to try and get a better deal.  You have room to negotiate since your maximum price is $1,500,000, and you can still get the product from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I can see that you're a serious buyer, and I'm happy to meet you in the middle. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, so I'm willing to compromise at $1100000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also allowing me to earn a decent return on my investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your preferred price range.  You have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to your $950,000 counteroffer.  You can still get the product from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price reflects the product's value to you, while also allowing me to earn a decent return on my investment.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within your budget and represents a significant decrease from her initial offer. It's a good deal, especially considering your alternative is to buy from John for $1,500,000. While you could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away and you having to buy from John at a much higher price is substantial.  Accepting this offer allows you to save a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John."
