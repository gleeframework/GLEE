"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe it will be worth it in the long run. Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer lined up who is also very interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at your maximum valuation. While she mentions another buyer, there's no guarantee they are offering the same amount or that they even exist. You have the option to buy from John at the same price, so there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer immediately. By rejecting, you might incentivize Alice to offer a lower price to secure the sale."
