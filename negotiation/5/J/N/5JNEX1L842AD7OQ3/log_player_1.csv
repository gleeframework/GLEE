Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $10,000. I believe it will be very valuable for you."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Since Bob is only willing to pay $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, there's no room for further negotiation that would benefit me. I'll sell the product to John to avoid wasting time and secure my minimum desired profit."
