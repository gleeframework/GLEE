Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving Room:**  $900,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This allows for potential counteroffers and ensures I have a good chance of closing a deal.
* **Being Courteous:**  I'm being polite and making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, increasing the chances of Bob responding positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  It's a good starting point for further negotiation. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's still interested in the product.  This means there's potential for a counteroffer that could be closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding a bad deal:** Selling for $600,000 would be a substantial loss for me. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $600,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product to you.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to emphasize why my price is reasonable.
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $675,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  We've both moved closer to the middle ground, and another round of counteroffers could lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:** Selling for $675,000 would leave me with a large financial loss. It's wiser to continue negotiations in hopes of achieving a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference and settle on $712,500. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 712500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** My counteroffer is exactly in between my previous offer ($750,000) and Bob's latest offer ($675,000).  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a middle ground. 
* **Highlighting fairness:** I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Creating urgency:** By suggesting a final offer, I create a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to accept."
