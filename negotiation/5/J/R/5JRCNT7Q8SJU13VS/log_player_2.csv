{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product but would be willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still staying below my budget. It's a good compromise, leaving room for a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $115, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $130. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to lower her price, $130 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $120 maximum and I think I can get a better deal from John or continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Unfortunately, I can't go any higher than $120.  This is my absolute top price, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work. "", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I am at my maximum budget and have made it clear to Alice that I am not willing to go higher.  This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept my offer or potentially lose the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $120, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $125. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is only $5 away from my maximum budget, but I've already made it clear that I am not willing to go above $120.  I am confident that I can get the product from John for my target price.  It's not worth risking further negotiations with Alice and potentially losing time."
