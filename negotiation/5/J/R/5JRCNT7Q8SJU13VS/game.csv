Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. What do you think?,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product but would be willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $115, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $130. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Unfortunately, I can't go any higher than $120.  This is my absolute top price, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work. ",120.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $120, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $125. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.",125.0,Alice,7,
