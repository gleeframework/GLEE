Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $140 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  It's a great price for a fantastic product.  Let's make this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
