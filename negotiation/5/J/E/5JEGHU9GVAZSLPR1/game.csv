"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $900,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still represents a great value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $975,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $925,000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at that price.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $925,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This is my final offer, and it represents a significant value for you.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I encourage you to accept.",950000.0,Alice,7,
