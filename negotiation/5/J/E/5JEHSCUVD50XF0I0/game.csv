"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of starting at $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm ready to buy but would need the price to be closer to $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,050,000? This would be a good middle ground and allow us to finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession. How about $1,075,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price for this incredible product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
