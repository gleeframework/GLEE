"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet my value for the product right away. If not, we can negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $11,000 is still a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I hope Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
