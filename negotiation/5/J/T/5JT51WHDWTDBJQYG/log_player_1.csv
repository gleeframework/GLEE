Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that you might be interested in. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely Bob will counter with a price closer to your target.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** By starting at $115, we're close to Bob's perceived value of $120. This increases the chances he'll see it as a reasonable deal and accept. 
* **Above Our Minimum:**  The price is still comfortably above our minimum of $100, ensuring we make a profit. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $100 matches John's offer, we still have room to negotiate with Bob.  Bob's initial rejection and counteroffer suggest he's interested but trying to get the best possible price. We'll aim for a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50?"", 
""product_price"": 107.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting a price directly in the middle of our previous offer ($115) and Bob's counteroffer ($100), we demonstrate a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Still Profitable:** $107.50 remains a profitable price for us, exceeding our minimum of $100.
* **Encourages Agreement:** This counteroffer aims to quickly move the negotiation towards a close, avoiding a protracted back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $107.50 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Profit:**  Bob's offer of $105 is a reasonable compromise and still yields a $5 profit over selling to John. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might only result in small increments, potentially prolonging the process without a significant gain.
* **Risk of Losing the Sale:**  There's always a risk that Bob will walk away if we push too hard, leaving us to settle for John's $100 offer. 
 
It's often better to secure a good deal than to risk it all for a slightly better one, especially when the difference is relatively small."
