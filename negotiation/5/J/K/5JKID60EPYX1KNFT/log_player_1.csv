{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's below my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay closer to my minimum.  If he rejects, I can counter with a higher offer, or go to John if it seems Bob isn't serious."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low, below my minimum.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to get closer to my desired amount.  If he won't budge, I can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value, but I have a budget in mind. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even after meeting in the middle.  At this point, it's clear he's not going to come close to my desired price.  I'm better off selling to John and getting my minimum value."
