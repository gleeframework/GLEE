Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,500? I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value to you.

**Reasoning:** While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly trying to meet me closer to my price point. Accepting at $13,500 secures a savings of $1,500 compared to John's offer. The potential savings from further negotiation are likely to be small and not worth the risk of Alice backing out."
