"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $760,000? It's a fair offer that reflects my budget and the value I see in the product.",760000.0,Bob,4,
