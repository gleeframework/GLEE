"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is more than his budget, and he can get the product from John for $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but there's no need to accept a price that's higher than John's."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $10,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11,250? It's still a good price for me, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above his budget, and while there's a chance he could negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll get a better deal. Buying from John ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
