"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, thank you for your offer of $850,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",925000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and agree on $887,500? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let me know what you think.",887500.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $887,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. However, I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,,
