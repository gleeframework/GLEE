"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $900,000 is still too high for him, as he values the product at $1,200,000.  He can do better by trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your offer of $850,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob still wants to save as much money as possible, and $925,000 is too high for him. He can do better by trying to negotiate further with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and agree on $887,500? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $887,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. However, I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would ideally like to pay less, Alice has come down to her minimum acceptable price. It is more advantageous for Bob to accept this offer than to risk further negotiation or buying from John at a significantly higher price.  At $900,000, Bob is still saving $300,000 compared to buying from John."
