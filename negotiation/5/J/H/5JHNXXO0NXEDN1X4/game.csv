"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,500,000, which is still a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain.  This offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal. I'm confident this price point is a win-win for both of us. ",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,350,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value and our previous discussions. I'm eager to reach a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. However,  $1,350,000 doesn't adequately reflect the value of this product and the potential it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. I'm eager to reach a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think this might not be the right fit. I've been trying to work with you and meet you halfway, but it seems we're too far apart.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $1,375,000. This is my best offer, and it's a significant reduction from my initial price. If you're not willing to meet me at this point, I'll need to consider other options.",1375000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,325,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I hope we can find a way to work together.",1325000.0,Bob,8,
