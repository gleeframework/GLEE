"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm capped at $120.  Let's see if we can make this work.",120.0,Bob,4,
