Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a higher offer ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will indicate how much he values the product and his willingness to pay. If he accepts outright, I get the best possible price.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $8,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
