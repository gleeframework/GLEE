Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $11,000 is a good price for the product, as it is lower than his maximum budget and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  It's better than buying from John for $12,000, and while there might be a chance to negotiate lower, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal."
