"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my budget. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the time I've invested in it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
