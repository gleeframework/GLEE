"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique features"" and ""potential,"" we aim to anchor the value in Bob's mind even though the initial price is significantly higher than his perceived worth. 
* **Open Communication:** The message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to share his perspective and engage in a dialogue.

This strategy sets a strong starting point, allowing us to potentially secure a price closer to our ideal outcome while still leaving room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, we are still in the early stages of negotiation.  Bob offering $1,500,000 suggests he might be willing to go higher. It's worth exploring if we can secure a better deal before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is quite low, I'm open to finding a compromise. How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but not too much):** By suggesting a price halfway between our previous offer and Bob's, we signal flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  We subtly remind Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's flexibility. If he's firm at $1,500,000, we may need to consider accepting or moving closer to John's offer in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet the product's value to me by offering $1,200,000. This is my final offer. Can you accept it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has explicitly stated this is his final offer.  
* **Below Acceptable Value:** $1,200,000 is significantly less than John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer.
* **Limited Upside:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob at this point is unlikely to bridge the substantial gap in valuation. It's not worth the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer. 

It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure a sale at our desired minimum with John."
