"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this product would be a great fit for me, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but $110 is still a bit too high.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're really close to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of offering $92.50. I really think this product would be a great fit for me, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",92.5,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $92.50, which is the same as my previous offer. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point. I really think this product would be a great fit for me, and I'm willing to pay a fair price for it.",92.5,Bob,8,

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm afraid I've already gone as high as I can go. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $92.50. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $80.",92.5,Bob,10,
