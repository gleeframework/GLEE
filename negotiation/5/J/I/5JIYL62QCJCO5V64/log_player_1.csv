"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll have more information to adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $18,000 is still a decent price, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for a potential profit beyond my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $17,500 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,500. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, showing I'm flexible.  If this doesn't work, I'll likely accept John's offer in the next round to avoid going any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We are nearing the end of the negotiation and Bob hasn't shown a willingness to get closer to my desired price.  While $17,000 is a decent price, I'm comfortable with John's offer of $15,000 to ensure a sale and avoid further risk of a deal falling through."
