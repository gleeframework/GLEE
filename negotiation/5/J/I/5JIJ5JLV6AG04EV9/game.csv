"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $85 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to negotiate, but $130 is still out of my price range.  How about we split the difference and settle at $105?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a fair price for this. $115 is my final offer - it's a great deal for this product.",115.0,Alice,5,
