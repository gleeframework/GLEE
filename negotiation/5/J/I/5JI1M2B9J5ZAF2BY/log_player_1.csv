"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with $1,800,000, you're setting a high anchor. Even if Bob doesn't accept this price, it might influence his counteroffer to be closer to your desired range.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value might make Bob more inclined to consider a higher price. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message invites Bob's feedback, emphasizing that this is the opening move in a negotiation, not a final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, my budget is limited to $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches his perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows you to try and secure a better deal. You have room to negotiate, especially with the backup option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget limitations, but the value of this product goes beyond that. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,500,000. This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** Showing a willingness to move from your initial price signals flexibility and encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value reinforces your position that a higher price is justified.
* **Middle Ground:**  The $1,500,000 counteroffer aims to split the difference between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, indicating a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate further. While $1,300,000 is closer to your target, you still have room to negotiate a higher price, especially with several rounds remaining. You're also still above your safety net price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** Acknowledging Bob's movement toward a compromise helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Simplified Proposal:**  Directly suggesting a middle ground of $1,400,000 makes your offer clear and concise, potentially speeding up the process.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation momentum going while still aiming for a price above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort to meet halfway, Alice. I am willing to consider $1,350,000 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,350,000 is a good offer. It's a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While you could try to negotiate further, the potential gain is shrinking, and Bob's increases are getting smaller. It's unlikely you'll get a much better offer from him.
* **Time Value:** You've already used 6 rounds of negotiation.  Closing the deal now gives you certainty and allows you to move on to other opportunities."
