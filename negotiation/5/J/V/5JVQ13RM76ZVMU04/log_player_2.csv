"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get something valuable at a fair price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum and cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
