"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to be flexible here, but $11,500 is simply too low. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, and I'm still not comfortable with that price.  Let's aim for $12,500. It's a compromise on my end, and it gives you a good value for the product.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to stretch my budget as far as possible. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,750. That's a fair compromise, and it ensures we both get a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still think $11,000 is a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to sweeten the deal by also purchasing the service you offer for $1,000, which I believe is worth $500 to me. This way, I'm essentially paying $11,500 for the product, but I'm only paying $11,000 in cash, and getting the service for free. I think this is a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,8,
