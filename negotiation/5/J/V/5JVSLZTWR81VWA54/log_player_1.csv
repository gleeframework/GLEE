Round 6
Bob's offer:

``` 
The goal is to maximize profit. While $11,000 is more than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation and the potential to get closer to the desired price.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows for further negotiation."

Round 7

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,750. That's a fair compromise, and it ensures we both get a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 11750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still think $11,000 is a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to sweeten the deal by also purchasing the service you offer for $1,000, which I believe is worth $500 to me. This way, I'm essentially paying $11,500 for the product, but I'm only paying $11,000 in cash, and getting the service for free. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is still a bit lower than desired, this offer is beneficial because:

* **Additional Value:** Bob is offering to buy the service for $1000, adding value to the deal even though it's not directly related to the product. This means the overall value of the transaction for Alice is closer to her desired amount.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  With only two rounds left, further negotiation might not yield a better outcome, and Alice risks losing the deal entirely. 
* **Potential for Future Collaboration:** Accepting the offer establishes a positive relationship with Bob, potentially leading to future business opportunities. 

Therefore, accepting this offer maximizes profit for the current situation and builds a positive relationship with Bob."
