Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  My asking price is $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** The price is lower than what Bob is willing to pay, which gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive, so it's more likely to start a productive conversation with Bob.

Keep in mind that you have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out. This gives you leverage to be firm with your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, you have leverage here because you know the product is worth more to him.  By rejecting his offer, you can try to get closer to your desired price of $11,500.  It's a risk, but the potential reward is worth it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $10,750? It's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit shy of the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd ideally like more, Bob's offer is only $500 less than your minimum. You've already had a few rounds of negotiation and it's getting closer to the value you'd get from John.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures you make a sale and get a decent price."
