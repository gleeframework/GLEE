Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal.  I know Bob is interested, but I'm also aware I can always sell to John for $150 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  While I'd like to sell, I'm not willing to accept such a big loss.  I'll counteroffer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept.  I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate, and $110 is still a decent profit."
