"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the potential benefits for both of us.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like I'm not being reasonable. 

**Important Note:**  While this is a good starting point, remember that the negotiation strategy should adapt based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $800000 for it. This aligns better with my budget constraints. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is far below my ideal, there's still room for negotiation. I can try to reach a compromise closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding John's offer for now:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I'm not desperate. I believe I can still get a better price through negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions. I will likely offer a price closer to the midpoint of our current positions ($1,400,000) while remaining firm on my minimum threshold of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply not enough for me to let go of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,400,000 for it to make sense for me.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within the ""zone of possible agreement"":**  I'm offering $1,400,000, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and Bob's offer of $800,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates the value of the product. 
* **Emphasize the need for compromise:** The message emphasizes that finding a compromise is essential to reaching an agreement.
* **Maintain a firm stance:**  I'm still holding my ground on the minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 but showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I still believe that $800000 would be a fair price for your product within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer remains too low:**  Bob is still unwilling to budge from his initial $800,000 offer. 
* **Negotiation is not progressing:**  There's little sign that Bob is willing to compromise.
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 4, and each round brings us closer to the deadline.

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, but this time I will be more aggressive.  I will offer a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price but emphasize that this is my final offer. I need to start pushing towards a deal before time runs out and I'm forced to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm going to be upfront.  $1,300,000 is my final offer.  It's lower than what I'd prefer, but it's a significant discount from my original price, and it's the closest I can come to meeting your budget.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to other options.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  I'm making it clear that this is my last offer, adding pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Reduced price:**  The offer is slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), demonstrating flexibility but still maintaining a profit. 
* **Time constraint:**  I'm emphasizing the limited time remaining, reminding Bob that he might lose the deal.
* **Stronger tone:**  The message has a firmer tone, reflecting the urgency of the situation and the need for a decision. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to sell to John or make another counteroffer.  However, I'm running out of time and I need to weigh the risk of losing the deal with the potential of getting a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I am unable to exceed $800000 for your product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has remained inflexible, refusing to budge beyond his initial $800,000 offer, despite multiple counteroffers. 
* **Time is running out:**  We are in round 6, with only four rounds left.  
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is above my minimum threshold and a much better deal than Bob's offer. 

**Conclusion:**

There is little chance of convincing Bob to increase his offer significantly in the remaining rounds.  Given the time constraint and John's secure offer, it is the best course of action to accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,500,000."
