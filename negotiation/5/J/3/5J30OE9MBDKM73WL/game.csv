"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a price that reflects the product's worth, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000, which is a significant step closer to your position. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position. To show I'm also committed to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,600,000.  However, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  I believe this demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
