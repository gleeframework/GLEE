Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Limit:** You know Bob values the product at $120, so offering it below that is pointless. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $135 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Balancing Profit vs. Guaranteed Sale:** While you could try a higher price, there's a risk Bob will reject it. Selling to John guarantees $150, so aiming for a price slightly above Bob's valuation strikes a good balance."
