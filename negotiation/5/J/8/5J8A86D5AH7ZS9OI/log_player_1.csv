Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for the highest price Bob might reasonably accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows room to potentially go down slightly if Bob counters, while still staying above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning listing it publicly implies Bob might miss out if he doesn't act quickly.

By starting high but remaining reasonable, Alice maximizes her chances of securing a deal close to Bob's perceived value while having John as a fallback option."
