"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $950,000, while John is selling it for $1,000,000. 
* **The offer is within your budget:** You are willing to spend up to $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is lower than that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
