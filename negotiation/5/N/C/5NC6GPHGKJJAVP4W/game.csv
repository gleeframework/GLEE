"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's make this happen.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's still within my budget.",8250.0,Bob,4,
