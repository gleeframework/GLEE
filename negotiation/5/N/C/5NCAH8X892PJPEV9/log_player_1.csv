Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, Alice wants to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, bringing the price closer to his perceived value of $800,000.
* **High Perceived Value:**  The message emphasizes exclusivity and value, aiming to justify the high price to Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while having the security of John's offer."
