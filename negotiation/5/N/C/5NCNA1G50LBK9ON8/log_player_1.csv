Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but below my minimum acceptable price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I can still try to get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $120.  While I'm getting closer to a deal with Bob, his offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Given John's offer is at my minimum, it's a safer bet to secure that deal and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
