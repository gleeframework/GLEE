"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Given the value of the product to me, I'm offering $8,500. This is a fair price, and I believe it's in our best interests to come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,500. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This should still be a good deal for you, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your increased offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a slightly higher counteroffer. I'm offering the product to you for $10,200. This is a reasonable compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable.",10200.0,Alice,5,
