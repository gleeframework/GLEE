"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is a fair price for you, it's unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000. This offer still allows me to recoup some of the value of the product while acknowledging its value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
