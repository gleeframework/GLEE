"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $14,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you've done your research and know you can find it cheaper elsewhere, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
