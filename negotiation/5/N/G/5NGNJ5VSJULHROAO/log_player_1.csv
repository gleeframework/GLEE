Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is my final offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I still think $925,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $775,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, the increments are too small to make significant progress within the remaining rounds. It's unlikely he'll reach $800,000 before we run out of rounds or his increases become even smaller. John offers a guaranteed $800,000, which is our minimum acceptable price.  It's better to secure the sale with John than risk Bob not reaching an acceptable price."
