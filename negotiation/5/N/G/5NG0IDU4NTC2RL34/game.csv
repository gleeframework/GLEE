"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I like the product, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $8,750 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,250 and $8,750. I'll sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great price for this amazing product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
