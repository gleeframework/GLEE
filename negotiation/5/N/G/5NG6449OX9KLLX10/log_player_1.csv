Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to aim higher with Bob to potentially earn more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $175 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere between his value ($100) and your minimum ($150). 
* **Confident Approach:**  A direct message without excessive justification can be effective. Bob doesn't need to know your minimum price or about John. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept even a lower price. This strategy simply aims to maximize your potential profit while considering your backup option."
