"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a little lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100? That's a good compromise and still leaves some room for both of us to be happy.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
