"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $700,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",725000.0,Alice,5,
