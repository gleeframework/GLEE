"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is only worth $800,000 to me, so I should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Alice's starting offer is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($650,000) than Alice's initial price ($850,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below my $800,000 limit.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is polite and acknowledges the product's value while directly stating my counteroffer. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** This first counteroffer sets the stage for a negotiation. Alice is likely to counter, and we can work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to my acceptable price range, $750,000 is still more than I want to spend. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $700,000? I believe that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Alice moved from $850,000 to $750,000.  I'm countering by moving from $650,000 to $700,000, essentially meeting her halfway between our previous offers. 
* **Compromise:** The message emphasizes that I'm looking for a fair compromise and believe this price represents that.
* **Nearing the Limit:** I'm getting closer to my $800,000 limit.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll need to decide how much more I'm willing to negotiate before going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $725,000 is a reasonable price, saving me $75,000 off my maximum and a significant amount from Alice's initial offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Alice is signaling this is her final offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll walk away. At this price, the potential savings from another counteroffer aren't worth the risk of losing the deal."
