"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go for $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $107.50. Can you consider this price?,107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $107.50 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further. How about we settle on $109?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll find the product to be worth it.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $109 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,6,
