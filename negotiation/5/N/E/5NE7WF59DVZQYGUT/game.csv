"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the negotiation.  However, $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $9,000 is getting closer, it's still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $8,750 for the product, which reflects its value to me and is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I am willing to consider $8,900 as the price for the product. This is my final offer before potentially considering another buyer. Let me know if this works for you.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit over my budget at $8,900. I understand this is a fair price for you, but I can only offer $8,250 for the product. It's the most I can realistically pay. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options.",8250.0,Bob,6,
