I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product is worth the same to him and it gives me a profit margin. I'm confident he'll accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed.  I'll keep John as a backup in case the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While $1,000,000 is still a profit, it's significantly less than what I'm aiming for. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer. I'll keep John as a backup in case the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,300,000.  This is a compromise, meeting him halfway while still securing a good profit for me.  Hopefully, he'll see the value in the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit too low. While $1,150,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,200,000.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more. If not, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,250,000. This is a final attempt to reach a deal with him.  I'm willing to lower my price a bit more, but I'm not going any lower than this.  If he rejects this offer, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is very close to my minimum price and it's higher than what John is offering.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal.  It's a good outcome and I'm happy with the profit."
