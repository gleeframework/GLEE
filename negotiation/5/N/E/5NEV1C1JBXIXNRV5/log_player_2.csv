"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget ($1,200,000).  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price. There's a chance she'll accept a counteroffer closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower price ($1,000,000) than Alice's offer ($1,400,000). This is a bold move, but it establishes my position as a serious buyer willing to negotiate.  While it's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, it sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than my budget, but closer.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my goal of $1,200,000.  There's still room for a counteroffer and potential for a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer from $1,000,000 to $1,150,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying and am willing to compromise. It also creates a more reasonable gap between our offers, making a deal more likely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my target of $1,200,000. I believe there's still potential for a deal at a lower price, especially since Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,225,000. This is a significant step closer to Alice's last offer ($1,250,000) and only $25,000 above my target price. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be forced to buy from John at $1,200,000.  This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to close the deal or risk losing the sale entirely."
