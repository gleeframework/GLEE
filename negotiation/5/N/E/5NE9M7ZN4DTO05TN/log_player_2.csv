"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of  $800,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a significantly lower offer ($800,000), we establish a negotiation range and signal that we're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial offer gives us ample room to move upwards in subsequent rounds while still staying well below our $1,000,000 maximum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will give us valuable information about Alice's flexibility and how low she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the unique benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down in price, $1,400,000 is still considerably more than your $1,000,000 limit and significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to lower her price suggests there's room for further negotiation. You haven't reached a point where accepting Alice's offer or going with John is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However, $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  We are increasing our offer, but only to $900,000, staying well below our maximum and leaving space for further negotiation.
* **Market Value Mention:** By mentioning ""market value,"" we subtly remind Alice that alternatives exist (like John's offer) without directly referencing them.
* **Conveying Seriousness:** We want to demonstrate to Alice that we're a serious buyer but not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for us both. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? This reflects my effort to meet you halfway while still respecting the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's offer is getting closer, $1,150,000 is still $150,000 over your budget. 
* **John is the Safer Bet:** At this point, John's offer of $1,000,000 is starting to look more appealing. There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and you risk losing the opportunity to secure the product at a price you know works. 

**Next Steps:** 
One more counteroffer is worth a shot, but it needs to be close to your absolute maximum to signal that you're reaching your limit. If Alice rejects it, buying from John is the most financially sound move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. I've stretched my budget as far as it can go. I can offer a final price of $975,000. If this works for you, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer makes it clear that this is your absolute limit and you won't go higher. 
* **Slight Increase:** A small increase from your previous offer shows movement on your side and might be enough to sway Alice.
* **Time to Decide:** This offer forces Alice to make a decision â€“ either accept a price slightly below her midpoint or risk losing the sale entirely."
