"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm looking for a price around $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth around $10,000 to me, so I could consider buying it for $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway and settle for $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $14,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend. Could you consider $8,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm still quite a ways from finding that acceptable.  It's clear this product holds value for you, how about we try $11,000?  This would be a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,7,
