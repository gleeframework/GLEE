"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the value you'll gain from it.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
