"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and still allows me to make a profit.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6,500.  I believe this is a fair compromise.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $6,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $8,250? That's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to come away feeling good about the deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're getting closer.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $7,375. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal work. ",7375.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,375 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for a more equitable compromise. How about $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,7,
