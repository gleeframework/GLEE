Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and still allows me to make a profit.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $6,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $8,250? That's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to come away feeling good about the deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,375 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for a more equitable compromise. How about $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?
