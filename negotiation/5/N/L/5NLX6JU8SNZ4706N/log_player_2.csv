While Alice's offer is better than John's, I'm aiming for the best possible price. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $135 is still a bit higher than my target.  I'm willing to pay $125. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value to me."", ""product_price"": 125}
