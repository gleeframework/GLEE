{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still $1,000 of potential profit for Bob, so he might be willing to accept.
* **It positions you as a fair seller:**  By not immediately demanding the full $15,000 value, you're showing a willingness to negotiate.

**Important:** Remember that the negotiation is dynamic. Based on Bob's reaction (accept, reject, counteroffer), you'll need to adjust your strategy accordingly."
