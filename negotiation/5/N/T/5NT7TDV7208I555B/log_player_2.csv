"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is higher than what you'd pay John ($1,000,000). While you want to save money, you know you can get a better price from John if you reject Alice's offer."
