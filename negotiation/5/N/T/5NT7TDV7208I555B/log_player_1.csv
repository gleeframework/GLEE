Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially settling on a price higher than John's offer.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, justifying the high price without seeming unreasonably greedy. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal from Bob while still ensuring a sale if he declines."
