Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a lot to you.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at the maximum I believe Bob might be willing to pay, knowing he values it at $800,000. This establishes a strong initial position.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I want the full $1,000,000, I'm open to negotiation. The message implies that I'm willing to discuss further, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.
* **Option to Walk Away:**  This strategy also allows me to confidently switch to John if negotiations with Bob stall or if Bob's counteroffers are too low.

**Important Note:** This is a high-risk strategy. It's possible that Bob will immediately reject the offer. However, it maximizes my potential earnings and leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Close:**  $900,000 is a significant amount, and it's tempting to accept. However, I still have room to negotiate further.
* **Higher Value to John:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000. This provides a solid safety net, and I can use that knowledge to push Bob further.
* **Negotiation Power:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better price. This gives me leverage in future negotiations. 

**Next Move:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob closer to my original asking price. The goal is to find a compromise that's closer to my desired outcome without risking the deal completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the unique value of this product for you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer of $950,000 is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  It's closer to Bob's offer than my original, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Re-emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefit he'll gain. This can influence his willingness to negotiate further. 
* **Open to Agreement:**  I end with a positive statement, showing that I'm still interested in reaching a deal, encouraging Bob to respond positively.

**Strategy:** 

This counteroffer is a strategic move, balancing the potential for a quick sale with the desire to earn closer to my target price.  By offering a compromise, I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency for Bob and encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $920,000 is only $30,000 away from my original asking price of $950,000.  This is a very small gap, considering my minimum value for the product is $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I continue to reject Bob's offers, there's a chance he'll walk away entirely. I don't want to risk losing this deal completely. 
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  While John's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale, and the difference in price is minimal.

**Conclusion:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale that is very close to my desired price, minimizing risk, and getting me closer to my goal.  It's a pragmatic decision that balances my desire for a high price with the reality of negotiation."
