"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of this product, $700,000 is a bit too steep for me at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,

I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to consider it.",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $675,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference.
