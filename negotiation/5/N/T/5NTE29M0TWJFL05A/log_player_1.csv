{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer provides a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price but allows for potential negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can counter with a higher price, and if he keeps rejecting, I can always go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price and significantly less than what John is willing to pay. I need to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price before accepting."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, recognizing the value you see in this product.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit far off from that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal.  I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $1,100,000, especially with John waiting in the wings to pay $1,500,000.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,075,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be very valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've thought about it, and I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but no more. It's the highest I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing too much money.  John is willing to pay a significantly higher price, so I'm going to sell to him."
