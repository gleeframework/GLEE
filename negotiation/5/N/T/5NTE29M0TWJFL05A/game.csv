"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, recognizing the value you see in this product.  Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit far off from that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,075,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be very valuable for you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but no more. It's the highest I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
