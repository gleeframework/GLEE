"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price. Let's work together to close this deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're still looking for a lower price, but $1,400,000 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,550,000. This is a very fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
