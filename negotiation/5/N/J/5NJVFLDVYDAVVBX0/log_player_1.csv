Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (anything less and you're better off with John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim as high as possible without alienating Bob entirely.  Since you have a backup offer, you can be a bit bolder. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This offer stands for the next 24 hours, after which I have a commitment from another buyer."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" emphasizes the product's benefits beyond just the monetary value.
* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,900,000 sets a high point for the negotiation. While it's unlikely Bob will accept this price, it gives you room to negotiate down. 
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Implied Competition:**  Mentioning another buyer subtly reminds Bob that he's not the only one interested.

**Important Note:** Be prepared to negotiate! Bob will likely counter-offer.  Your goal is to get as close to your $1,500,000 minimum while ensuring Bob feels like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal."
