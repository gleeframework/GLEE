"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, it's still above my maximum budget. I want to try negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll reject the initial offer and see if I can get her to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be happy to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $135 is within my budget, and it's closer to my initial counteroffer. I'm willing to accept this deal as it's a reasonable price for both of us.  Continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal altogether, or having to buy from John at a higher price."
