"Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $7,500 is better than John's offer of $8,000.
* However, Bob can potentially get an even better price by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming to get the lowest possible price. 
* Offering $7,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $7,500. 
* This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and may be appealing to Alice, who wants to sell the product."
