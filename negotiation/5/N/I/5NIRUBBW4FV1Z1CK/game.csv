"I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $700000. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering your budget constraints. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to consider a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $900000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. This is still a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
