"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is a great price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.
