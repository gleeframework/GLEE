"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm not going straight for the $120 value Bob places on it. This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Using a friendly and inviting tone sets a good foundation for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:** While $85 is close to my minimum, I know the product is worth more to Bob.  There's still room for negotiation to get closer to a more favorable price.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to walk away if necessary. This builds my negotiating power. 
* **Preparing for Counteroffer:**  By rejecting, I'll be able to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more than that.  Let's meet in the middle at $92.50.  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm offering a counter-offer that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good price. 
* **Friendly but Firm Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly tone while also conveying that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Targeted Price:**  $92.50 is a good starting point for the next round. It's likely Bob will find that more attractive than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** While $90 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher amount, ideally closer to $95. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. Bob is clearly interested, and I can use this to push for a better deal.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** Rejecting allows me to send a counteroffer in the next round, which will likely get me closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still just a little off on the price. How about we split the difference and settle on $91? It's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 91}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** Offering $91 is a small compromise from my previous counteroffer, showing flexibility without sacrificing too much.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Pressure Point:** With a few rounds left, this offer puts pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal."
