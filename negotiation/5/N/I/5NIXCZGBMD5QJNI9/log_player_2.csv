"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value for the product. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more than that.  Let's meet in the middle at $92.50.  This gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above what I'm aiming for. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm incrementally increasing my offer to show willingness to negotiate while staying below her proposed midpoint. This should encourage her to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still just a little off on the price. How about we split the difference and settle on $91? It's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly set on staying above $90. While I could push further, the potential savings are minimal at this point. Accepting at $91 secures a reasonable deal."
