"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant investment, but I believe its value to you will far exceed the price.  Consider its potential worth of $1,200,000. If this offer doesn't suit you, I have another buyer ready to pay $800,000.  Let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from Alice, which is less than the $1,200,000 John wants.
* **Saving money is the goal:**  Even though the product is potentially worth more to you, your goal is to save money."
