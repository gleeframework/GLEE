"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay. How about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
