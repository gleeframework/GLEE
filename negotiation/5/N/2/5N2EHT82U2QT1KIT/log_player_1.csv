Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $18,000. I believe it presents significant value, and this offer reflects its worth in the current market. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  This gives her room to start with a significantly higher offer.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies a reason for the high price (""worth in the current market"") even without specifics.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), inviting Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, Alice aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts, Alice gains a significant profit above her minimum.
2. **Gauge Bob's Willingness:** Bob's response will reveal if he's willing to pay above market value or if Alice needs to negotiate down closer to John's offer."
