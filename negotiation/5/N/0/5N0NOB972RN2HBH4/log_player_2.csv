"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000} 
``` 
 
Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so he's starting with a low counteroffer. This is a significant reduction from Alice's original price, and it's unlikely Alice will accept it, but it's a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob still wants to save as much money as possible, and $18,000 is still too high. It's best to keep trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
``` 

Bob is increasing his counteroffer to $8,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's last offer, but still below his maximum value of $10,000. This approach aims to show Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but also trying to get a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob should continue negotiating to get a lower price. He can either make a counteroffer or risk buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price, but he's still trying to save as much as possible. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice that he's willing to pay more, but not willing to go above his $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still trying to save money and $14,500 is still above his desired price point.  Since this is a significant price difference, he should continue to negotiate, pushing for a lower price. It's worth attempting a counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

Bob is getting close to his maximum price but is trying to get the best deal possible. By offering $11,000, Bob shows Alice he's willing to pay more, but he's still not willing to go above his limit. It's a compromise that could convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point, continuing to negotiate might take more time and energy. At this point, buying from John for $10,000 is the most efficient choice. Bob can secure the product within his budget and avoid further negotiations."
