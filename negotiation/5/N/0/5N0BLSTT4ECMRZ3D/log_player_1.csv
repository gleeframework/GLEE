Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire [Product Name]. However, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss something closer to $500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept his offer, given the time constraints and the possibility of getting a better deal, I will reject his offer. 

I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob, aiming to close the gap but still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price. However, $500,000 doesn't reflect the true value of [Product Name]. Considering its potential benefits for your [mention potential benefits again], I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still allows you to secure a valuable asset while giving me a fair return. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's perspective:** I start by acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price to show I'm listening and open to negotiation.

* **Open for discussion:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to engage in further dialogue and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my needs. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $750000. This would better align with my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's closer to my desired range, it's not yet a good enough deal. Given that we have only 6 rounds remaining, I need to push for a higher price.  I will reject his offer and continue to negotiate to hopefully secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 still falls short of the value I've placed on [Product Name].  Let's split the difference - how about $900,000? This price acknowledges your budget while allowing me to secure a reasonable return. I'm confident this deal would be mutually beneficial. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider $850000 as a fair price for [Product Name]. This would allow us to move forward with the transaction while keeping my budget in mind. I hope this proposal is acceptable.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I have only 4 rounds remaining, so I need to push for a higher price if possible.  I will reject his offer and make another counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $850,000. It shows we're both making progress towards an agreement.  However, I'm still a bit short of my target. To make this deal work, I need to come in at $950,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging progress:** I highlight the progress we've made in the negotiation, demonstrating a positive and collaborative approach.
* **Reiterating target:** I restate my target price but frame it as a ""final offer,""  creating a sense of urgency and potentially encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Emphasizing value:** I highlight the significant investment and the potential opportunity for Bob to acquire the product at a competitive price.
* **Open-ended question:** I conclude with an open-ended question to keep the conversation going and to see if Bob is ready to agree.

This approach attempts to incentivize Bob to accept the offer while still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to find a solution that satisfies both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to go up to $900000 for [Product Name]. This would allow us to close the deal while respecting our respective positions. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my desired price. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching an agreement within the limited time frame is high. Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures a guaranteed profit and secures a deal without further negotiation."
