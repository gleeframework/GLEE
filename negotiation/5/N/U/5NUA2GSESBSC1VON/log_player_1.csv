Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I know you'll value it highly. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum of $80, leaving room for negotiation, but also offers a decent discount from Bob's perceived value of $100.  It leaves room for counteroffers without immediately risking a rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Can you meet me at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is more than your minimum, it's significantly lower than your initial offer and closer to your ""sell to John"" price. It's worth trying to get a better deal before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $85? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a bit more.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $85, which would be $80. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is the same as John's offer.  There is no benefit to continuing negotiation with Bob as you can secure the same price with John without further rounds of negotiation."
