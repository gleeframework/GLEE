Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,360,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,340,000. This is a fair compromise and a price I'm confident we can both agree on. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,340,000

While I could push for more, Bob is consistently moving towards my price point, and $1,340,000 is a healthy profit. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him by being too aggressive."
