"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I believe the value of this product is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What do you say?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. What do you think?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  Let's meet in the middle - $1,360,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber. I'm hopeful we can close this deal today.",1360000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,360,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,340,000. This is a fair compromise and a price I'm confident we can both agree on. What do you say?",1340000.0,Bob,6,
