"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $60. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. It's still a good deal considering the product's value, and I believe it will be worth the investment for you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $70. Would you be willing to meet me there?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $85?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer and closer to your target. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being fair for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little bit. Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $75 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to go down to $80.  This is a fair price that considers the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal and make it happen.",80.0,Alice,7,
