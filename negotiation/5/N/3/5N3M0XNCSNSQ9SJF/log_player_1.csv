{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* This price allows for a potential compromise while still ensuring a decent profit for me. 
* The message is friendly and inviting, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000. 
* By starting with a relatively high offer, I create room for counteroffers from Bob.
* If Bob rejects, I can potentially lower the price in increments until we reach a mutually agreeable price or I decide to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $13,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $15,000.**  While it is tempting to accept his offer, I'm holding out for a better price.
* **I have a guaranteed backup option with John.**  This gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a better price.** It shows him that I'm not desperate to sell.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $13,000.  I might try to meet him halfway by offering $12,000.  
* This allows for some wiggle room while still keeping the price above my minimum value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I appreciate your offer.  To be honest, $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,000, but this is really my final offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is $1,500 higher than Bob's last offer, but still $2,000 below my minimum value. This is a compromise that acknowledges Bob's budget constraints but still protects my profit margin.
* **Message:**  The message is firm but friendly. It emphasizes that this is my final offer, while still showing understanding for Bob's perspective.  It focuses on the benefits of reaching a deal for both of us, making it more likely Bob will accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Setting a Deadline:**  By calling it my final offer, I create a sense of urgency and pressure on Bob to accept.  This increases the likelihood that he'll agree to a price closer to my desired price.
* **Balancing Profit and Compromise:**  The offer of $13,000 balances my desire for a higher profit with the need to reach an agreement with Bob. It's a strategic compromise that could lead to a successful negotiation.
* **Maintaining Options:** If Bob still rejects, I can still go ahead and sell to John for $15,000. This ensures that I'm not losing out on a guaranteed profit."
