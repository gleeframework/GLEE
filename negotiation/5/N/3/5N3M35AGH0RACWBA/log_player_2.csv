"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's a good idea to start by rejecting Alice's initial offer. You're aiming to get a better price, and $110 is still too high. By rejecting, you open the door for negotiation and can start pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $108. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still trying to get the best possible deal, and $108 is still a bit higher than your target.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation moving towards your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $108 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to pay $106.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $107. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you've made significant progress in the negotiation. Alice's offer of $107 is within your acceptable range, and it's likely that you won't be able to get a lower price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of going to another seller or potentially getting a worse price in future rounds."
