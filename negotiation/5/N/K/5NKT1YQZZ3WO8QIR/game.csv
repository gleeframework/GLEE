"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to go down to $105. This is my final offer, as I'm sure you know, I can sell this product to John for $120 at any time. I'm confident you'll be happy with the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Alice,5,
