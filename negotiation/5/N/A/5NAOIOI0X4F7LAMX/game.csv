"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still asking for $13,000. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is still too low. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with your purchase.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the compromise. How about we settle at $12,000 even? That's the absolute top of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,6,
