Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's estimated value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible within the 10 rounds. I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiating, I won't sell the product for less than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm confident that I can still reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still asking for $13,000. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is closer to my target, it's still below my minimum value. I'm not ready to sell at this price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can convince Bob to come up a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is still too low. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the compromise. How about we settle at $12,000 even? That's the absolute top of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum value, Bob's offer is still a bit too low for me. With only 4 rounds left, I don't have much time to negotiate further. It's better to sell to John for $15,000 and ensure I get my desired price."
