"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? This would still give you a great deal on the product, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $8,250 is a bit too rich for my blood. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's the price John is offering it to me, and I'd rather do business with you.",8000.0,Bob,4,
