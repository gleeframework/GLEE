Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000.  I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering a price too close to John's $12,000 offer ($12,500 or less) increases the risk of Bob rejecting the deal and you having to settle for your backup option."
