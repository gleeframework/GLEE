Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. My initial offer is $2,300,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the product's worth and the benefits it will bring you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial offer is quite high. While I am interested in the product, I believe a price closer to $1,100,000 would be more reasonable given its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both your minimum and the product's actual value to him. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is far greater than $1,100,000. It represents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will yield significant returns for your business. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a fair and realistic price considering the product's potential."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but we're still quite far apart on price.  To be frank, $2,000,000 is not feasible for me.  I could consider a price closer to $1,350,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the potential benefits this product offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your baseline, it's still significantly lower than what you know he's willing to pay. You have leverage knowing his valuation of the product, and there's still room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  I've considered your perspective and I'm ready to make this work.  To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I propose a final offer of $1,800,000. This price represents a significant investment on your part but one that I believe will be highly rewarding for you in the long run."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You've made another substantial drop in price, signaling to Bob that you're serious about closing the deal. 
* **Anchoring:** By sticking to a figure above $1,500,000, you maintain a strong position and keep the negotiation focused on the higher end of the potential price range.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Framing this as your ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision without dragging out the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated, but $1,800,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000. I feel this is a very competitive offer, and I'm hoping we can close this deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching Your Baseline:** Bob's offer is getting very close to your guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You still have some leverage as Bob is eager to purchase and has shown a willingness to go higher.  
* **Potential Upside:** There's still a chance to secure a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I can see you're serious about this product. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is my absolute final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This offer splits the difference between your last offer and Bob's last counter-offer, signaling significant movement towards a deal.
* **Firm but Fair:**  You're holding firm above your baseline while still offering a price that should be enticing to Bob, considering his valuation.
* **Finality:** Re-emphasizing this as your ""absolute final offer"" reinforces the urgency and encourages a decision."
