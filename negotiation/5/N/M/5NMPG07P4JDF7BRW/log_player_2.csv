"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room to negotiate upwards if needed while staying well below my $8,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I do $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is meeting me closer to the middle, which is good. However, I know I can get it for $8,000 from John.  I'll try to negotiate a bit further before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

This counteroffer brings me closer to Alice's price while staying under my $8,000 limit. There's still a chance she might negotiate further down."
