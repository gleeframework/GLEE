Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, I'll try to get a good price for it. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $10,000. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer of my own.
