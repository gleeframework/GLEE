Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below her own minimum ($12,000).
* **Create Urgency:**  By setting a high but potentially acceptable price, Alice creates a sense of urgency. Bob knows she has other options (John), making him more likely to consider the offer seriously.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested. This could lead to a slightly higher sale price than a straight $12,000."
