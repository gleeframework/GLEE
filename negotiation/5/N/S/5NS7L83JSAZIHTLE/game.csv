"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500.  This is still a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
