{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500.  This is still a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
