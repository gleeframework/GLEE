Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  The price is higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You're still making a profit, as your minimum value is $12,000. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're confident in the product's value and are willing to negotiate, but not desperate to sell.

This approach sets the stage for a potential negotiation where you can explore if Bob is willing to pay closer to your desired value. Remember, you always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. It's possible Bob might be willing to increase his offer slightly, especially since he expressed interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my original offer. How about $9,500? It's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

Here's why I chose this counteroffer:

* **It's a compromise:** It's halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000.
* **It's still above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate further.
* **It shows I'm flexible:**  By lowering my price slightly, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to work with Bob.

This counteroffer positions me to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price without giving away too much profit. It also keeps the negotiation going and avoids the need to sell to John at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to exceed my budget. I would like to propose $8,500 as my final offer. This is the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the product. I hope this aligns with your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident I can get him to move much higher, and it risks further delaying the sale. I'm choosing to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John instead of risking a prolonged negotiation with Bob."
