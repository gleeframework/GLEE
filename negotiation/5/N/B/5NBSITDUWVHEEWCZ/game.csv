"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While the product is intriguing, I'm not comfortable with that starting price. To make this deal work, I'd need to see a price closer to $900,000.  This would give us both a fair deal and allow for some room for negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I think this price is more in line with the product's value and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's find a price that's more mutually beneficial.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This price represents a fair value for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
