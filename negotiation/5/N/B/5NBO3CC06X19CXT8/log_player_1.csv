Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $95 is higher than your minimum price of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value of $100, giving him an incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while maintaining a good chance of reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $85 is above your minimum of $80, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $95.  You can likely get closer to your desired price. 

By rejecting his offer, you demonstrate that you're not willing to settle for a low price and open the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Meets you halfway:** It's a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's offer, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **Maintains a profitable price:** $90 is still above your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **Reinforces the value:** It highlights the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that is both profitable for you and attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $90 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $87 is still a bit below the $90 you initially counter-offered, it's closer to your minimum of $80.  It's worth considering that further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price, especially if Bob is firm on his offer.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and prevents the risk of losing him as a buyer altogether."
