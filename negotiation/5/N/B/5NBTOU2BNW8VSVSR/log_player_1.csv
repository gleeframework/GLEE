Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $150 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Message:** A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a question, making it clear I'm open to negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've earned a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth negotiating further. 
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low or if I feel the negotiation is going nowhere, I'll sell to John for $120 to ensure I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  While Bob has shown interest, I believe there's still room for negotiation. A counteroffer might lead to a price closer to my target.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. This will keep the negotiation going and hopefully lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering $125, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($120) and Bob's offer ($110). This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive and persuasive language:** I emphasize the value of the product for both of us to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  $125 is still above my minimum, leaving space for further negotiation if Bob rejects again.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a price close to my desired range.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's split the difference and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation stalled:** Bob's offer hasn't moved much from his initial offer. This suggests he might not be willing to pay closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John secures a profit:**  By selling to John for $120, I can ensure a profit without further negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I've decided to sell to John for $120 to secure a guaranteed profit. This avoids risking further negotiation with Bob that may lead to a lower final price."
