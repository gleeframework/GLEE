Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I still need to see a bit more. How about $850,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal considering the value you place on the product.  Let's get this deal done.
