Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth a significant amount to you and allows me to get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer for the product, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can offer $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 Bob's offer is too low. It's still early in the negotiation, and I can try to get a better price from him. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you have a budget, but $700,000 is just too low for me. It's well below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a more substantial offer. How about $900,000?  It's still a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than the value you've placed on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a living. I can offer $825,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $825,000 is closer to my target, I believe I can still get more from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I still need to see a bit more. How about $850,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal considering the value you place on the product.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be careful with my budget. I can offer $825,000 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, and we've already gone through several rounds. Time is running out, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. John is a sure thing for $1,000,000, so it's best to take the guaranteed sale now."
