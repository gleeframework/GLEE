"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth a significant amount to you and allows me to get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer for the product, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can offer $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you have a budget, but $700,000 is just too low for me. It's well below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a more substantial offer. How about $900,000?  It's still a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than the value you've placed on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a living. I can offer $825,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I still need to see a bit more. How about $850,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal considering the value you place on the product.  Let's get this deal done.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be careful with my budget. I can offer $825,000 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",825000.0,Bob,6,
