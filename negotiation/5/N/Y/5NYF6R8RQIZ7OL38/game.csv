"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair offer considering the current market.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I can sell the product to you for $950,000. It's a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could go up to $725,000.  This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while being mindful of my budget limitations.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $725,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can sell the product to you for $875,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
