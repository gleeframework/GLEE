"I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but $10,000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $17,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about $13,000, would that work for you?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think $13,000 is a bit short. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the product's value.",14500.0,Alice,5,
