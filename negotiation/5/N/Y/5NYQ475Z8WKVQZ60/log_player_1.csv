Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer Alice should make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice won't accept less than $12,000 because she has a guaranteed sale at that price from John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  There's a $2,000 difference between what Bob values the product for and Alice's minimum acceptable price.

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice needs to propose a price that is:

1. **Higher than her minimum:**  She wants to maximize her profit.
2. **Potentially acceptable to Bob:**  It shouldn't be so high that Bob automatically rejects it.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Price:** $11,500 is a starting point. It's closer to Bob's valuation while still giving Alice room for negotiation.
* **The Message:** 
    * It's friendly and emphasizes value to Bob.
    * It presents the price as negotiable, increasing the chance of a deal.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start slightly higher.
* **Time Constraints:** If Alice needs to sell quickly, she might be more willing to accept a lower offer.

**Outcome**

This offer gives Alice and Bob a good starting point for negotiation. Bob might:

* **Accept:**  He gets the product for $1,500 less than Alice's initial asking price.
* **Counter-offer:** This opens up further negotiation.
* **Reject:**  Alice sells to John for her guaranteed $12,000."
