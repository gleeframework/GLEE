"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,000. This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
