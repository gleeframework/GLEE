"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth at least $15,000 to me.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's well below its market value.  Let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  While it's a good deal, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth more than that to me. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
