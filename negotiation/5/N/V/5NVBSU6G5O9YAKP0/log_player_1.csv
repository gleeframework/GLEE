"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my profit.  Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'm hoping to get as close to that value as possible.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to close the deal, selling for $80 would be a huge loss. I need to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my offer from $200 to $120. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a compromise to hopefully entice Bob to accept. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's an increase from his initial offer, it's not enough for me to make a decent profit. I'm still hopeful that we can reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this point.  I will continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly. I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give the product away. I'm hoping that he will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm starting to get nervous as the rounds are ticking by. While selling to John would guarantee a decent profit, I still want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob. I'll make one more counteroffer and see what happens."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

This is my final offer to Bob. I'm lowering the price again, but I'm getting closer to his value.  I'm hoping that this time he will see that it's a fair price for both of us. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John, as it's becoming clear that we can't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. We've reached a point where Bob and I are stuck, unable to find a compromise.  While $95 is a better price than Bob's previous offers, it's still not enough for me to feel comfortable. I'd rather take the guaranteed $150 from John and move on."
