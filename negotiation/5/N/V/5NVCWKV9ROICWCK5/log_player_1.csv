Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. Bob values the product at $12,000, so he has some wiggle room to potentially accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer of $11,000 is within my desired range and is a good deal.  Accepting his offer is the best strategy."
