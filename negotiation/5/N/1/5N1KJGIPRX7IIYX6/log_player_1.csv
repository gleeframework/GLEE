Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room for compromise.  I believe he'll be motivated to negotiate as he values the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise and hopefully leads to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $7,800 is only slightly below my minimum. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and a profit."
