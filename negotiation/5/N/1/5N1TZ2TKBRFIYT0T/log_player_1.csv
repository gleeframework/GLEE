"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  How about $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
