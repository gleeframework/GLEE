"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I believe it holds immense value, and while my ideal price is above your initial assessment, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.  To start, I propose a price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** My first offer is significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This anchors the negotiation high and leaves room for strategic concessions.
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to convey that the product is worth the high price while acknowledging Bob's perspective and showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:**  The large gap between the initial offer and Bob's value allows me to make gradual concessions in subsequent rounds if needed. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I understand the product is valuable, but I'm only comfortable paying up to $850,000.  This reflects the maximum value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he increased his offer slightly, it's not enough to warrant accepting or stopping the negotiation with John as a backup. I'll use the remaining rounds to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. However,  $850,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the product's unique value and the significant return on investment it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but hold firm that $850,000 is too low. The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price.
* **Strategic Concession:** My counteroffer is a significant decrease from my initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, it remains significantly above Bob's offer, encouraging him to make a substantial move if he's genuinely interested. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With each round, the pressure increases. This counteroffer aims to push Bob to recognize the value and make a more serious offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $850,000, but his language suggests he's feeling the pressure (""firm on my previous offer,"" ""explore other options"").  He might be bluffing, or he might be genuinely near his limit. 

I'm not willing to accept his offer yet. I'll make one more significant concession to test his resolve before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and want to see if we can find a solution.  I'm willing to make a significant move and drop my price to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a compromise that acknowledges the value you'd gain while reflecting the product's worth. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is a strong signal to Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal but not willing to go below this price.
* **Significant Concession, Justified:** The large price drop emphasizes my willingness to compromise. The message reinforces that this is a one-time offer due to the value proposition.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only five rounds left, the clock is ticking for Bob to make a decision. This offer increases the urgency for him to act.

This strategy aims to either secure a deal at a price significantly above Bob's initial offer or prompt a counteroffer that reveals whether a mutually beneficial agreement is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while your offer is getting closer, it's still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but I can't go any higher. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Movement Is Slow:** Even after my significant concession, Bob only increased his offer by $50,000. This indicates he is unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price within the remaining rounds. 
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** John's standing offer guarantees me my minimum desired profit. Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on a potential $100,000.
* **Limited Time:**  With only four rounds left, the risk of continuing with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing is too high. 

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
