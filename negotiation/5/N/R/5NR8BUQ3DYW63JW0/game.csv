"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I believe it holds immense value, and while my ideal price is above your initial assessment, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.  To start, I propose a price of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I understand the product is valuable, but I'm only comfortable paying up to $850,000.  This reflects the maximum value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. However,  $850,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the product's unique value and the significant return on investment it offers.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and want to see if we can find a solution.  I'm willing to make a significant move and drop my price to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a compromise that acknowledges the value you'd gain while reflecting the product's worth. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while your offer is getting closer, it's still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but I can't go any higher. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",900000.0,Bob,6,
