"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for less than $12,000, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best choice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get the price down a bit. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a revised price of $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are still better off trying to get the price lower by counter-offering. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $11,000. This is a fair price that gets us both closer to our desired price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm willing to make one more offer. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer. You're still getting the product for less than your maximum budget, and you've already pushed her down significantly from her initial offer. Further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether, and you'd be forced to pay John $15,000."
