Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob incentive to engage.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to see it as a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $1,250,000, I have room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **The John Factor:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 is my safety net. If negotiations with Bob break down, I can still secure a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can counteroffer at a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's.
* **John's Offer:**  While selling to John guarantees a profit, I'm not desperate to do so.  I have a strong bargaining position with Bob and want to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still holding out for a good price. 
* **Highlighting the Deal:**  I emphasize that the price would still be a ""great deal"" for Bob, reinforcing the value of the product to him.
* **Fair Profit:** I mention a ""fair profit"" for me to justify my stance and make the offer seem reasonable.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while giving Bob a clear opportunity to accept a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're looking to make a fair profit, and I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,225,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has stated this is his ""final offer,"" indicating further negotiation is unlikely.
* **Close to My Minimum:**  The offer is only $500 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** Rejecting Bob's offer might result in him walking away, forcing me to settle for John's lower offer.

While it's not my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical choice. It minimizes the risk of losing the deal and still allows me to secure a decent profit."
