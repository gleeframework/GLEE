"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're looking to make a fair profit, and I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,225,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200500.0,Bob,4,
