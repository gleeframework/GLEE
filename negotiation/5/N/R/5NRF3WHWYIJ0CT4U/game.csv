"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects.  I could consider coming down to $1,100,000.  This is a fairer reflection of its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could potentially go up to $700,000, but that's my limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $700,000.  My final offer is $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,5,
