"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will greatly benefit your business. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing the details further and am prepared to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product's value might be even higher than Bob initially thought.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the product's benefits for Bob and highlights my willingness to negotiate. This promotes a collaborative and positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By starting high, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation in my favor. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffer will likely be higher than if I had started with a lower price. 

**Important Note:** I am fully aware that I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000.  I will keep this in mind throughout the negotiation, adjusting my strategy if necessary to ensure I maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but that price is unfortunately not feasible for me. I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would make sense for me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is far from ideal, his message suggests a willingness to negotiate. I believe there's still room to work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have the security of John's offer ($1,200,000), which gives me leverage in my negotiation with Bob. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer in the next round with a price significantly closer to my minimum, but still leaving some space for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for your business. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:**  I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer ($1,600,000 to $1,450,000) to show flexibility. However, this price still keeps me well above both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's initial offer. 
* **Justification and Value Framing:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob's business. By focusing on the potential benefits, I aim to shift his focus from the price alone.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Tactic:** While not a true middle ground, framing it this way can make the offer seem more reasonable and encourage Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer.
* **Time Constraint (7 Rounds Remaining):**  I'm conscious that we have limited rounds.  I will continue to adjust my approach and potentially reduce my asking price more aggressively if needed to reach an agreement within the time frame."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product represents, but $1,450,000 is still outside my budget. To be frank, I'm working with a maximum of $800,000.  Could you consider something closer to that range? Perhaps $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $750,000 is better than his previous offer but still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Revealed Valuation:** Bob has now revealed that his maximum budget is $800,000. This is important information, as it tells me the absolute ceiling of what I can potentially get from him.
* **Time to Push:**  We have 6 rounds left, and it's time to apply a bit more pressure. I will make a counteroffer significantly closer to my minimum, leaving Bob to decide if he's willing to come up at all.

**Next Steps:** My next counteroffer will aim to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range. While I'm aware of Bob's $800,000 limit, I won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product. I'm prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I need to be upfront: $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product represents a significant investment on my end, and I need a price that reflects its true value.  I'm willing to make one more move to try and find a solution. Let's settle this right now: $1,200,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** I'm shifting my communication style to be more direct and firm, making it clear that I'm serious about my bottom line.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and limiting further back-and-forth, which could be counterproductive at this stage.
* **My Minimum, But Justified:** I'm presenting my absolute minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). However, I'm not just stating the number. I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the investment it represents.
* **Calculated Risk:**  This is a calculated risk. Bob might walk away, but by anchoring the negotiation at my minimum, I maximize my potential gain if he decides to accept. I'm prepared to proceed with John's offer if Bob rejects it."
