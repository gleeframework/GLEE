"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will greatly benefit your business. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing the details further and am prepared to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but that price is unfortunately not feasible for me. I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would make sense for me.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for your business. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product represents, but $1,450,000 is still outside my budget. To be frank, I'm working with a maximum of $800,000.  Could you consider something closer to that range? Perhaps $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I need to be upfront: $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product represents a significant investment on my end, and I need a price that reflects its true value.  I'm willing to make one more move to try and find a solution. Let's settle this right now: $1,200,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
