"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will greatly benefit your business. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing the details further and am prepared to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far above your maximum price. You should reject the offer and propose a counteroffer significantly lower, closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but that price is unfortunately not feasible for me. I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would make sense for me.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for your business. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down slightly, $1,450,000 is still significantly higher than your target price and even your maximum budget.  You should continue negotiating and move closer to a more reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value this product represents, but $1,450,000 is still outside my budget. To be frank, I'm working with a maximum of $800,000.  Could you consider something closer to that range? Perhaps $750,000?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I need to be upfront: $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product represents a significant investment on my end, and I need a price that reflects its true value.  I'm willing to make one more move to try and find a solution. Let's settle this right now: $1,200,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

This is a strategic decision point. Here's why:

* **Alice revealed her bottom line:** Her ""final offer"" of $1,200,000 tells you she won't go any lower.  This is valuable information.
* **You have a guaranteed alternative:** John offers a price you find acceptable ($800,000).
* **Limited negotiation room:**  Even if you could get Alice to budge slightly from her ""final offer,"" it's unlikely to be a substantial difference. 

By choosing to buy from John, you secure the product at a price comfortable for you without the risk of prolonged negotiation that might not yield a significantly better outcome."
