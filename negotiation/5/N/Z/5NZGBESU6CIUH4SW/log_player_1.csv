Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $160 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum selling price. This gives you room to negotiate and might even lead to Bob accepting a price higher than he initially planned. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $160, there's a good chance Bob will counteroffer. This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation where you can gradually lower the price while gauging his interest.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $120.  If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, you can walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is still significantly less than your minimum selling price of $120. Accepting would mean a $20 loss compared to selling to John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By rejecting, you signal to Bob that you're serious about getting a better price. This keeps the negotiation open. 

You should aim for a counteroffer somewhere between $100 and your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming back with a price.  While I can't go as low as $100, I'm willing to come down to $140. I think that's a fair price for the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer ($160) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to your target.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value, you're reminding Bob of its worth and justifying the higher price point. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You haven't gone down too much, keeping some bargaining power for future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $130 is more than your minimum selling price of $120. Accepting this offer secures you a $10 profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could try to push for a slightly higher price in another round, there's no guarantee Bob will budge further. It's possible he might even lower his offer. Accepting now locks in a reasonable profit. 
* **John as a Baseline:** Remember, you always have John as a backup buyer at $120. Taking the $130 offer from Bob is a better outcome."
