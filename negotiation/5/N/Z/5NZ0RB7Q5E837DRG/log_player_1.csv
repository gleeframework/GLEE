"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will find this price attractive, as it's significantly less than the product's value to him.  I'm hoping to get as close to his value as possible while still securing a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to close the deal closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm reducing my price a bit, showing flexibility while still aiming for a good profit.  I believe this counteroffer is attractive to Bob, and we may be able to close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired range, and I'm getting a significant profit. I'm confident I won't be able to get much higher, so it's time to accept and close the deal."
