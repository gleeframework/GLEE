"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be extremely valuable to you.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to the right buyer.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a one-time offer. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1000000. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
