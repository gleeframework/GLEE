"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired selling point. This provides room for concessions and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room:** By starting at $1,600,000, there's space to come down significantly over the next 10 rounds while still aiming for a price above your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** The fact that you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000 gives you a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, it's too early to settle.  There's still room for negotiation, and we have ample rounds left. Accepting now would mean leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal while acknowledging the product's inherent value."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial concession from $1,600,000 to $1,450,000, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to move towards a deal.
* **Holding Firm:**  We're still significantly above Bob's offer and our guaranteed price, leaving room for further negotiation while aiming high.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes fairness and the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth beyond his initial assessment.
* **Time Consideration:**  We have plenty of rounds remaining, allowing us to make gradual concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to come down, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which indicates willingness to negotiate and suggests he values the product.
* **Room for Growth:** While $1,300,000 is closer to our minimum, we're still in the early rounds. With 6 rounds remaining, there's a good chance we can push for a better deal.
* **Alternative Safety Net:**  The guaranteed offer from John provides a safety net, allowing us to confidently continue negotiating with Bob without the fear of losing out completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing progress in our discussions, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try $1,375,000. This represents a significant move on my end while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's last offer ($1,300,000) and our previous counteroffer ($1,450,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Maintaining Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth beyond his current offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By making a smaller concession this round, we're signaling that we're getting closer to our bottom line while still encouraging Bob to move upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a significant profit above our minimum ($1,200,000) and John's guaranteed offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could potentially negotiate for a bit more, Bob's incremental increases are getting smaller.  Continuing carries the risk of him lowering his offer or stalling negotiations.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds.  It's better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it by pushing too hard."
