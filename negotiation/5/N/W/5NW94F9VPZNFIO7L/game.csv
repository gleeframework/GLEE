"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $11,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $11,000 is a tempting offer, the product's value is significant, and I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,500. Would you be open to meeting in the middle?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm still looking to save more.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
