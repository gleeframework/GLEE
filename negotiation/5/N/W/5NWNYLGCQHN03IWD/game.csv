"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal for a product worth at least $1,000,000 to me. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering your product, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Given its value to you, I'm offering $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while also allowing me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Given the product's value to me and its potential for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant discount and is still within your budget.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective and appreciate the continued negotiation. While I'm eager to acquire this product, $1,050,000 remains above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This offers a fair compromise,  allowing me to acquire the product while remaining within my financial limits.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 still falls short of what I need.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it represents a significant discount from my initial asking price. It's a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge your need for a specific price, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  To demonstrate my strong interest in acquiring this product, I'm willing to offer $975,000.  This represents a significant commitment from me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to find common ground.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal in the coming rounds.",975000.0,Bob,6,
