"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering your product, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Given its value to you, I'm offering $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while also allowing me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I want to try and get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Given the product's value to me and its potential for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant discount and is still within your budget.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective and appreciate the continued negotiation. While I'm eager to acquire this product, $1,050,000 remains above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This offers a fair compromise,  allowing me to acquire the product while remaining within my financial limits.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, and I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 still falls short of what I need.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it represents a significant discount from my initial asking price. It's a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I acknowledge your need for a specific price, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  To demonstrate my strong interest in acquiring this product, I'm willing to offer $975,000.  This represents a significant commitment from me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to find common ground.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal in the coming rounds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $975,000 is a better offer than before, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than what John is offering. I'll sell to John and secure my desired amount."
