Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding my minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still guaranteeing a profit if he accepts. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
