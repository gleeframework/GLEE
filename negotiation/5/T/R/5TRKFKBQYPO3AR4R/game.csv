"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1100000. This is the best I can do, but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I've already been flexible with the price. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here.",980000.0,Alice,5,
