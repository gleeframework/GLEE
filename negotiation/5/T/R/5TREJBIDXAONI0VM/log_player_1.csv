Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I'm confident it will be highly valuable to your endeavors."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a strong offer that still represents significant value to me while being reasonably attractive to Bob, given his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in the product's value can subtly influence Bob's perception and encourage him to accept the offer."
