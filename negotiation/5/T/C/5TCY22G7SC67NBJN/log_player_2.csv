"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$400,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows me to potentially get an even better deal. I'm not in a rush, and 10 rounds gives me plenty of time to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get Alice to meet me halfway.  This price is still well within my budget and gives me some room to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $350,000, which is a good compromise. While I'd love to get it even lower, I'm not sure how much more room for negotiation there is. Accepting now saves me time and potential headaches of further negotiation. This price is still significantly lower than John's offer, making it a good deal."
