"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,800,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,500,000 wouldn't be representative of that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I need to stay within my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,600,000. I hope this is a price that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
