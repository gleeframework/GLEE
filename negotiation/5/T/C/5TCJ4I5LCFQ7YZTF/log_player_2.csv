Round 5
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still above your maximum value of $15,000. You can keep trying to negotiate a lower price, but it's getting risky to continue since you're approaching the halfway point of your negotiation rounds. You have a reliable alternative with John who is willing to sell the product for your maximum value, so you might consider that if you don't get a better offer from Alice in the next few rounds."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer but $17,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. How about we split the difference at $16,250? This would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16250}
