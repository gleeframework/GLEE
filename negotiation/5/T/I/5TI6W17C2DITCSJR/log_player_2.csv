Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $120. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, this is a really nice product, and I appreciate your flexibility. How about we settle this right now at $105?  That's a firm offer, but I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already offered you $115 in the last round, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm starting to think that maybe we're just not going to meet in the middle on this one. If you're not willing to meet me at $115, I'm going to have to consider selling the product to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

It seems Alice is firm on her price, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation, as the price difference is now minimal. John's offer guarantees the product at a reasonable price."
