"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $90.",90.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that."
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $120. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer you the product for $115, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let me know if that works for you."
"I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. I can see that we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50. That's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, this is a really nice product, and I appreciate your flexibility. How about we settle this right now at $105?  That's a firm offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",105.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I understand that you think $105 is a fair compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already offered you a few dollars below my minimum price, and I don't want to lose money on the deal. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $115, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that works for you."
"I've already offered you $115 in the last round, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm starting to think that maybe we're just not going to meet in the middle on this one. If you're not willing to meet me at $115, I'm going to have to consider selling the product to someone else.",115.0,Alice,7,,
