I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but it also reflects the value of the product to me. I'm confident I can get at least $12,000 from John if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counteroffer with my minimum price of $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept. If not, I can always sell to John for the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price. While $11,000 is close, I'm going to sell to John.  I've made a good effort with Bob, but I'm not going to risk getting less than I know I can get elsewhere."
