Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150, the goal is to get the highest price possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with a price slightly lower than John's offer ($140) leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate upward. 
* **Appeal to Value:** The message doesn't reveal the minimum price ($150) and frames the offer as potentially valuable to Bob.

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
