"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 represents the value I place on this, I could meet you halfway at $100. This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to split the difference and pay $90. This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is consistently moving towards a price that's beneficial for me. While I could push for more, accepting $90 guarantees a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
