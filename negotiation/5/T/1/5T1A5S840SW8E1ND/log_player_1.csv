Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's a bit lower than I hoped for, it's still a significant amount of money and higher than selling to John.  There's a chance Bob will reject my counteroffer in the next round and I might end up with nothing.  Taking this offer ensures I at least get something for my product."
