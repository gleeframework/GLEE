"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come up with a solution that benefits both of us. Considering the value of the product to you, I propose we set the price at $11,000. This is slightly above your initial offer but still below my original asking price. I hope this proposal is more agreeable.",11000.0,Alice,3,
