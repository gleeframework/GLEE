{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a starting point that allows for potential negotiation but also ensures you receive a significant portion of the value you place on the product. 
* **Message:**  A friendly and encouraging message that highlights the value for Bob while leaving room for negotiation.

This offer sets a firm starting point while still allowing for flexibility in the negotiation process. It also opens the door for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing you to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation doesn't work out."
