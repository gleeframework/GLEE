"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's a great product, but I've done some research and I think it's worth less than what you're asking for.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, but $90 is below its value to me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $95? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is close, but to be fair to myself I can't go below $100. This is my final offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet in the middle. How about we try $97.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,6,
