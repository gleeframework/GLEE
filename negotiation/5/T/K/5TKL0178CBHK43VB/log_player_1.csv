Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $17,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value Isn't Realistic:**  In a real negotiation, you wouldn't know Bob values the product at $12,000. This response simulates a realistic scenario.
* **Starting High:** It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired price. This leaves room for bargaining and makes it more likely to land closer to your ideal outcome.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely hints at the product's value (""Given its value..."") to justify the high price without revealing your absolute bottom line. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters!"
