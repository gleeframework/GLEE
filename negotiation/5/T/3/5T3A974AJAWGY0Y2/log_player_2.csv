# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,275,000.  At this point, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of Alice walking away, and it's better to secure the product for $1,000,000 from John."
