Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor. 
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't rationally pay more than this.
* **The Zone:** Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 represents a potential deal where both you and Bob benefit.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and the high demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal that reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're emphasizing the product's exclusivity and demand, subtly anchoring Bob's perception of its value.
* **High but Negotiable:** The $1,450,000 price is aggressive but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the offer's fairness, you're more likely to get Bob to consider it seriously.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate. You have a strong alternative with John, so you can afford to walk away from a deal with Bob if it's not advantageous."
