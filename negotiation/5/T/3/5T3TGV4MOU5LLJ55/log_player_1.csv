"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think it's worth $140, but I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $130 is a reasonable starting point, as it's within Bob's perceived value of $80 and my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging message could help Bob feel more inclined to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is still interested, and I can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  While John's offer of $120 is good, I'm willing to try and see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $115?  That's a good middle ground, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by making a counteroffer.
* **Middle Ground:** $115 is a compromise between my minimum ($120) and Bob's offer ($100).
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and emphasizing a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is secure:**  While John's offer of $120 is tempting, I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your continued interest. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? It's just a small step closer to my price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  $112.50 is the midpoint between my previous offer ($115) and Bob's offer ($110).
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and understanding tone to encourage Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is now below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** There's very little room left for negotiation, and Bob's offers are getting progressively lower.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  At this point, it's no longer worth risking further negotiation with Bob.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
