"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $70 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, so I can't accept it. I'll reject and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum value. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still aim for a fair price.  If Bob rejects again, I'll have to consider selling to John, as time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price. While I'd prefer more, accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations that could lead to a lower price or even a sale to John."
