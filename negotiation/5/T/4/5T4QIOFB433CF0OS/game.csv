"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway again! However, I'm still a bit short on my desired price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $8,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and my original price of $11,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,
