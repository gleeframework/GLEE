``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly above the known value for Bob, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also sets a positive tone, acknowledging Bob's potential interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $10,500 is a good deal for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800.

While $9,800 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer of $9,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I could continue to negotiate, I don't want to risk losing a sale to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price.  I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
