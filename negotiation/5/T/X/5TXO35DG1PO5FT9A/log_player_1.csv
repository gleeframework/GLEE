I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. I'm still confident I can get a better price from him or John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, considering the value this product brings to you. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}

While $10,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I have John as a backup option, so I can afford to be a little more patient."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $10,000. This is my final offer. Please let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a tough call, as I'm only earning $5,000 more than my minimum acceptable price. However, the clock is ticking, and I don't want to risk losing both Bob and John. It's better to take a slightly lower price than risk ending up with nothing."
