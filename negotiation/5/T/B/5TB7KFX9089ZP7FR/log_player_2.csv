"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really like it. Would you like to buy it from me for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, and $90 is still more than you'd like to spend. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can do $88, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Would you be willing to meet me at $88? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can get the product for $88, which is within your budget and a better price than John's offer.  It's worth accepting this offer."
