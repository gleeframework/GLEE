{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by counter-offering.
* **Buying from John is the worst option.** It would cost you the most. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering a price slightly above Alice's minimum value ($1,000,000) to show I'm serious about buying. 
* **Room for compromise:**  This leaves room for Alice to counter-offer without going too far below my budget. 
* **Goal:**  To get the price down as close to $1,000,000 as possible without risking the deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's closer to my budget, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  I can counter-offer again and potentially get a better deal. 
* **Buying from John is still the worst option.**  It would cost me the most.

By rejecting Alice's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to get a price closer to my target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not desperate to accept her price. 
* **Middle Ground:** This offer is closer to the middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's most recent one.
* **Goal:**  To continue moving the price down towards my target while remaining within my budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high.** It's above my target price and closer to John's price, which is undesirable.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  I can continue to counter-offer and try to get a better deal. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to get a better price from Alice.

By rejecting Alice's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to get a price closer to my target."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still within my budget and above Alice's likely minimum.
* **Middle Ground:** It's closer to the middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's last offer, showing I'm serious about negotiating.
* **Goal:**  To continue pushing towards a price closer to my target while avoiding a stalemate or having to accept a high price from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting too close to John's price.**  The difference between her offer and John's is only $100,000.  
* **Limited rounds left:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation process. 
* **Risk of stalemate:**  If I keep rejecting Alice's offers, there's a risk she'll also reject my counteroffers, leading to a stalemate.

While I'd prefer a lower price, it's not worth risking a failed negotiation with Alice when John is offering a reasonable price. Buying from John ensures I get the product while staying within my budget."
