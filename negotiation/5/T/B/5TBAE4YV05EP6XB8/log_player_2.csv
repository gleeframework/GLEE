"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $800000 to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer and sell it to you for $700000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a discounted price. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to get this product for closer to $650,000. It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $675000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original offer I made. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $675,000 is a good compromise.  While you initially wanted $650,000,  it's a significant discount from the original $800,000 and better than buying from John.  Accepting the offer saves you $125,000."
