"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, but I have to be honest with you, I've had another buyer interested in it for $15,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000, which is a very competitive price considering its value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Even though Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  There's no need to settle for a higher price."
