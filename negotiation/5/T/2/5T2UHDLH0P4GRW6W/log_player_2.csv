"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for a price of $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly below its market value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $12,000 is a decent price, there's a good chance I can get Alice to come down further.  I'm willing to risk it since my alternative is John at $15,000."
