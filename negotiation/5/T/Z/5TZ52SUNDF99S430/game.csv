"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $12,750? This is the best I can do, but I'm really interested in the product.",12750.0,Bob,4,
