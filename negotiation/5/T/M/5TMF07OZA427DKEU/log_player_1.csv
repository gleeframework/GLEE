Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get closer to my desired price range by countering Bob's offer."

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $950,000 is simply not a feasible number for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000.

It's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price.  While $975,000 is tempting, it's still below my desired price point.  To guarantee my financial goals, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
