"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Can you consider this price?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $115? I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider this price?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $105 is as low as I can go. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. I think that's a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet there.",90.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to walk away, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up just yet. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we meet at $102? It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",102.0,Alice,9,
