Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. $10,000 is really pushing it.  How about $14,000, and we have a deal?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I had hoped to spend.  How about we split the difference and call it $12,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, his ""final offer"" is still below my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
