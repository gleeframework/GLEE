"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $20,000 to start the negotiations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me, I was thinking something closer to $8,000 would be more reasonable.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $16,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could we possibly settle around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. $10,000 is really pushing it.  How about $14,000, and we have a deal?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I had hoped to spend.  How about we split the difference and call it $12,000?  That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
