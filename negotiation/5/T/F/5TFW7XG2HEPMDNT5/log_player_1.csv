"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000, as I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $17,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is still a good price for me and shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to sell for much less than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. I'm going to accept his offer of $18,000. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate and potentially having Bob walk away."
