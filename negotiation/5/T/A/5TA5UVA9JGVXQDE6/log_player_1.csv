"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This is to leave room for negotiation and hopefully get a higher price than my minimum acceptable offer.  I'm also keeping in mind that Bob has a lower valuation for the product, but I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable offer, it's still below my desired outcome. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob.  I want to see if I can get him to come closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer from the previous round to $1,600,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while still giving me a significant profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable offer, it's still not enough to justify selling at this point. I'm still hopeful that I can get Bob to pay more, especially considering he has a lower valuation than me.  I'll continue to negotiate with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but only slightly. This shows Bob that I am serious about selling the product to him, but I'm still not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my ideal. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is too low. While I am willing to negotiate, I've already lowered my price significantly and it's unlikely he will come much closer to my minimum acceptable offer.  To avoid further negotiations, I'm going to sell the product to John at the guaranteed price of $1,500,000. This ensures a profit that meets my expectations and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower price."
