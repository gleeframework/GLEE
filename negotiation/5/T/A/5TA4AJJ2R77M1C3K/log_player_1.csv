Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think it would be a great deal for you!"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:**  Alice values the product at $150, so she shouldn't sell it for less. She has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $120.  
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Offering a price between $120 and $150 gives Bob a chance to get the product for more than he values it, while still earning Alice more than her minimum.
* **Why $135?**  It's a strong starting point, closer to Alice's desired price, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers."
