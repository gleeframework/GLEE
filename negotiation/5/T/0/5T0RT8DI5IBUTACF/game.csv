"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand your pricing. However, I am hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget.

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
