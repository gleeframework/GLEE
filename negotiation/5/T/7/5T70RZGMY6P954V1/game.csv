"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500. Would that work for you?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $11,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $12,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
