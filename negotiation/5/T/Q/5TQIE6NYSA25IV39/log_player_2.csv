"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and what John is offering.  You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That price is a bit high for me though. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Within Budget:** It's important to stay within your $100 budget.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This offer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I really need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down in price, $140 is still above your $100 budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests there might be a price you can both agree on. 
* **John's Offer:**  Remember, you have John's offer of $100 as a backup, so you don't need to settle above that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $140 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $95? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but staying well within our budget.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer moves significantly closer to Alice's $140 while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By phrasing it as a ""fair offer,"" we're subtly implying this might be our best offer before considering John's deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:** Alice's language suggests she's unlikely to go much lower than $110.
* **Within $10 of John:**  The difference between Alice's final offer and John's guaranteed price is now quite small. 
* **Not Worth the Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her holding firm or the negotiation breaking down. You'd likely only save a small amount, if anything at all.  

It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $100."
