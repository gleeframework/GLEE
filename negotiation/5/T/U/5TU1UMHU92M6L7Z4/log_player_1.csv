Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer leaves $100,000 on the table for Bob, which could incentivize him to accept. It also allows room for potential negotiation if he counters, while still ensuring a significant profit for me.  However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I can only pay up to $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can secure a better deal than what Bob is currently offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000?  That still gives you a significant gain, and it's a fair compromise for me. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
