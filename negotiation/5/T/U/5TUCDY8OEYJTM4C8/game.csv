"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $11,500, and that's the lowest I can go. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're still talking, Bob! However, I'm not willing to give up on the extra $250. I can do $10,600, and that's as low as I can go. I'm making a concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",10600.0,Alice,9,
