"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my maximum limit. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $18,000 represents the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet halfway â€“ would you consider $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours? Would $11,500 work for you?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate the compromise, $11,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on my last offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,6,
