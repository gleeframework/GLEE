"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, knowing the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling willingness to negotiate by asking for Bob's thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Floor:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $8,000 (my minimum).
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's offer is my minimum, so there's room for me to get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **More Rounds:**  I have 9 more rounds to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting him halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  I remind Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but that the product is valuable to me.
* **Positive Tone:**  I keep the message positive to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Floor:** Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds left, I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob.
* **Safeguard:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob that might result in a lower price."
