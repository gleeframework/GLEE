Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's potential."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  However, I need the price to be lower. I can do $1,250,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but we're still significantly below our minimum and John's guaranteed offer.  We need to signal we're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss. We'll counteroffer in the next round to guide the price closer to our target."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's still a bit too high for me.  How about $1,400,000? That's a very competitive offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting very close to John's offer, but Bob's offer is still below our minimum. We're getting into the later rounds, so a counteroffer now aims to push him closer to our desired price point before we might have to concede and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Your offer is very close to what I can accept. To make this happen, let's settle at $1,600,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to apply some pressure and signal we're reaching our limit. We're offering a compromise above his last offer but still well above John's price.  Marking this as a ""final offer"" might encourage him to accept, but we're also aware that we have John's offer to fall back on if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,450,000.  This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is holding firm, and his ""final offer"" is below our minimum and only slightly below John's guaranteed price.  There's minimal room left for negotiation, and it's unlikely we'll get a better offer from Bob at this point. It's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed $1,500,000."
