"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I think the product is a great value, but I was hoping to get a better price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $110 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Bob,4,
