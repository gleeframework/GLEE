Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he counters. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth more than Bob's perceived $12,000.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" and asking for Bob's ""thoughts"" signals that Alice is open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room to reach an agreement with Bob. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has her fallback option of John at $12,000."
