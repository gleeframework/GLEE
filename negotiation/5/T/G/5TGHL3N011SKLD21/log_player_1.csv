Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves you some room to bargain down if necessary.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A very high starting price might make Bob walk away immediately. 

This strategy allows for a potential negotiation while also ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum value. If Bob rejects, you can always adjust your counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to accept his offer just yet. I believe I can get a better deal by countering his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I've already lowered my price significantly and further concessions would result in a loss for me. Given that John is willing to pay my full asking price of $10,000, it makes more sense to sell the product to him rather than continue negotiating with Bob."
