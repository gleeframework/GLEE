Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates a bit, selling at $9,500 is a much better outcome than selling to John for $8,000."
