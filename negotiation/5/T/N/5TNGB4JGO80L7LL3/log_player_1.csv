Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150. This allows some room for negotiation, but still positions me in a strong starting point. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a price closer to my initial asking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss.  I will counteroffer Bob to try and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go too far below my initial price. I believe this counteroffer is fair and might entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $150. I've been through a few rounds of negotiation and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him."
