Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go all the way down to $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $80, which would be $82.50. Would you be willing to meet me there?

It's time to cut bait. Alice is unlikely to go down to $80, and while saving $2.50 is nice, it's not worth the risk of her increasing her price again. You have a guaranteed offer from John at your target price."
