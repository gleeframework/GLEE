Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** The phrase ""Given its value"" subtly implies that the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone of the message is open-ended (""What do you think?""), indicating willingness to negotiate.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering a very high price might make Bob immediately disengage.  This strategy balances a potentially higher profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
