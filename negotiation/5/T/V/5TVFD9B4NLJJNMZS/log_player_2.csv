"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and value, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's much better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $22,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Given my budget, I'd be willing to offer $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, but still significantly higher than his maximum budget. This is a starting point for negotiation and allows for room to compromise. It's also a signal that Bob is serious about buying the product but is looking for a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  I could come down to $19,000.  This is a serious offer reflecting the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it is still significantly higher than Bob's budget. It's crucial to continue negotiating and try to bring the price closer to Bob's acceptable range.  There's still room for compromise, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $19,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a substantial increase from my last offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, but he's still staying within his negotiation range.  This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is determined to get a better deal. By increasing his offer, Bob is showing good faith while still attempting to negotiate a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is still a long way off from where I'd need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  This offer reflects my effort to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, her offer of $15,500 is still too high for Bob. He needs to continue to push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer will keep the negotiation going and allows Bob to make a counteroffer closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $15,500 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Considering the value I place on this product and my budget, I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer and represents my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show progress:** Bob is increasing his offer, but staying within his negotiation range, showing that he's taking Alice's offers seriously and is willing to compromise.
* **Final offer:** By declaring this as his ""final offer,"" Bob creates pressure on Alice. If she rejects it, he may walk away and buy from John.
* **Strategic price:** $12,000 is a good midpoint between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest one. It leaves room for further negotiation but also shows that Bob is firm on his budget."
