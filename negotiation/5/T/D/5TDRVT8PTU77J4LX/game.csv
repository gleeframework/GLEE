"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that benefits both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is quite a bit above my budget. Given the value you placed on the product, I believe a price of $1,200,000 would be a fair starting point for negotiation. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a starting point, it's a significant gap from what I have in mind. To move this forward, I can offer the product for $2,100,000. This reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $2,100,000 is still outside my price range. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while also being within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
