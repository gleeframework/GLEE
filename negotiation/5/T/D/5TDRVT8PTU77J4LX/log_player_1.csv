"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that benefits both of us."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price acts as an anchor, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value. 
* **Openness:**  The message expresses a willingness to negotiate, signaling that you're flexible and want to find a mutually agreeable outcome. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while acknowledging Bob's interest and keeping the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is quite a bit above my budget. Given the value you placed on the product, I believe a price of $1,200,000 would be a fair starting point for negotiation. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum and John's offer. Rejecting keeps the negotiation alive and allows you to counter with a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a starting point, it's a significant gap from what I have in mind. To move this forward, I can offer the product for $2,100,000. This reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer shows movement from your initial price while still remaining firm above both Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Justification:** Emphasizing the ""true value and potential"" reinforces your position and provides a reason for the high price. 
* **Encouraging Movement:**  By making a significant concession, you encourage Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $2,100,000 is still outside my price range. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while also being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's offer, your absolute bottom line. While you could try to push for more, there's a risk Bob will walk away or the negotiation will stall. Accepting now secures a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price."
