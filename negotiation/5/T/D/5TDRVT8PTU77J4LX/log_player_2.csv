Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a starting point, it's a significant gap from what I have in mind. To move this forward, I can offer the product for $2,100,000. This reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000.
