Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth a lot to me. I'd be happy to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts in the middle ground. It's above my minimum of $80, but leaves room for negotiation and recognizes Bob's potential value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $100.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $100 for this product.  Would you consider $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I can't go above $92 for this product. Let me know if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal of $100, Bob has been firm in his counteroffers.  Accepting $92 is a good deal, especially compared to selling to John for $80."
