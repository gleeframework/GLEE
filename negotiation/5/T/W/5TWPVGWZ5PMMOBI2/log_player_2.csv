"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to start the conversation at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price and potentially get closer to his $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its value, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by making a significant counteroffer. He's dropping the price by $2,000, which is a bold move, but it demonstrates his serious interest while still leaving room for negotiation.  The message emphasizes the product's value, suggesting Bob is open to a deal but needs a price that better aligns with his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $13,000 is a better price than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. He can still buy from John, providing a safety net if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $12,500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's aim for a win-win solution."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly but staying below Alice's last offer. This shows he is taking her offer seriously and is willing to meet halfway. The message reinforces the idea of a mutually beneficial deal and encourages Alice to compromise further."
