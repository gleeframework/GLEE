I'm starting with a high price, but it's still below what the product is worth to me.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's acceptable to both of us."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $12,000, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $14,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000?  This is a good price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting closer, I'm worried we're running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's more than acceptable to me."
