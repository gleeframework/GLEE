Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, but let me know if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay even slightly more.
* **High Starting Point:** $11,999 is just below your guaranteed price, leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on the product's value and encourages questions, making it more likely for Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:** While Bob only values the product at $8,000, there's always a chance he might be willing to pay more due to urgency, lack of alternatives, or other factors you might be unaware of. This strategy aims to capitalize on that possibility."
