* You've successfully negotiated a lower price, saving $80,000 compared to Alice's initial offer.
*  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of not reaching an agreement and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high at this point. 
* Accepting this offer is the most sensible option to secure the product within your budget."
