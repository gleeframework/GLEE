Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $100 to Bob.  I'm confident he'll be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum value of $100. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering to sell the product for $95. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. It's also closer to my minimum value and still leaves room for Bob to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $100. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a deal."

I'm offering $90, which is still a fair price for both of us. It's only $10 less than my previous offer, showing I'm committed to finding a solution. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting frustrating. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, it feels like he's just trying to wear me down.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  It's not the ideal price, but it's better than selling to Bob for less than I value the product."
