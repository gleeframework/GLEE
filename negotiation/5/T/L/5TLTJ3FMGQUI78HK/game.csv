"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, however.  How about $1,250,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to go down to $1,220,000? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",1220000.0,Bob,4,
