"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $9,500. I believe this product will be highly beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's starting price is quite high. There's a good chance to negotiate a significantly lower price, closer to Alice's perceived value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aggressively targets a price closer to Alice's valuation. It leaves room for negotiation while signaling a strong desire for a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate.  We are aiming for a price closer to $8,000 and accepting $9,000 would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

We are now getting very close to Alice's likely minimum price. This offer offers a fair compromise while still allowing for the possibility of a slight discount."
