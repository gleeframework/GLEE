"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a compromise, Bob! I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $12,000. How about we meet at $12,250? It's a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm willing to give a bit more to get a deal done.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for your product, and I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,250 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet halfway again and go with $11,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, $11,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $12,000 again? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about $11,500?  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. ",11500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to go below $12,000, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $12,250 again? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",12250.0,Alice,9,
