"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation, and I have 9 more rounds to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal.  $10,000 is still a fair price for both of us, leaving room for compromise.  I'm also framing it as a collaborative effort to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. I still have 7 rounds left and can try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to negotiate by offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's last offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet in the middle while still trying to get a price closer to my goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to find a compromise, Bob! I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $12,000. How about we meet at $12,250? It's a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm willing to give a bit more to get a deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is increasing her offer again, but it's still above my target price. I have 5 rounds left and can continue to negotiate for a lower price. I'm not desperate to buy from Alice, and I can always buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for your product, and I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,250 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet halfway again and go with $11,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to use the ""meet in the middle"" strategy, but this time I'm focusing on the fact that this would be a ""fair price"" for both of us. This emphasizes that I'm looking for a compromise and not just trying to lowball her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, $11,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $12,000 again? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is back to her initial offer of $12,000. While it's a fair price, I still have 3 rounds left and believe I can get a slightly better deal. I'm not in a rush, and I can always buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about $11,500?  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with the ""meet in the middle"" strategy, aiming for a price that's a compromise between my last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate, while still trying to get a price closer to my goal. I'm also highlighting that we're ""getting closer"" and expressing confidence in finalizing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go below $12,000, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $12,250 again? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round, and Alice is sticking to her price of $12,250. While it's not a terrible price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I've exhausted my negotiation options, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a higher price than necessary.  It's better to go with John at this point and avoid the risk of Alice potentially refusing my counteroffer in the final round."
