"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a great deal. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $100. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the deal, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $80? "", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a significant step down from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but also leaves room for further bargaining if necessary.  $80 is still within my budget, but it allows for some wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $85. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met me halfway, and $85 is a good price within my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will counter with a higher price or I'll run out of rounds and have to buy from John for $100. It's better to secure the deal at this point."
