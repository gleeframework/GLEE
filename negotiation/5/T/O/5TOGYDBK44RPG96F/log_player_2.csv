"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. My initial offer for the product is $11500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum value for the product. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to adjust my offer. I propose that we settle on $11000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, Bob still has room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price. He's still aiming to save as much money as possible, and the difference between $11,000 and his desired price point is significant enough to warrant another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,750. This feels like a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer. My counteroffer for the product is $10875. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,875 is very close to Bob's desired price point of $10,750.  Considering there are only 5 rounds remaining, it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer. Further negotiation could potentially save a few hundred dollars, but there's a risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that's significantly lower than his maximum value, and within his desired range."
