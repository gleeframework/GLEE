"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. If you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer for $800,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing.** She claims she'll sell the product for less than it's worth to her ($800,000) if you decline. This is unlikely as it would be a loss for her.
* **You have a better alternative.** John is offering the product at your maximum price ($1,000,000). While Alice's offer is tempting, there's a chance you can negotiate a better price with her or stick with John. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you force her to either:

1. **Negotiate a lower price** closer to her actual value of $800,000.
2. **Accept your rejection**, in which case you can still buy from John at $1,000,000."
