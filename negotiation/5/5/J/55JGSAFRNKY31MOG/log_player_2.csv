"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000, a fair price considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is under your $12,000 limit, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale."
