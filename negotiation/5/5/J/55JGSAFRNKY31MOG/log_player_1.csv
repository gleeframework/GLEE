Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000, a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so aiming high is beneficial.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, the offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially settling around $10,000 - $11,000.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $8,000 from John, ensuring she doesn't lose out completely.

This strategy balances ambition with a safety net, maximizing the potential profit from the sale."
