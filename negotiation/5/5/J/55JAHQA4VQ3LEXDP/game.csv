"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value this product offers.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
