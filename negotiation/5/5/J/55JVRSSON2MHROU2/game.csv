"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $175 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $140?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $162.50. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",162.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $162.50 is still a little high for me, though.  How about $155?  That seems like a fair compromise.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $157.50. It's the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",157.5,Alice,5,
