"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $10,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $7,500 is still a bit low for me. How about $9,000 and we have a deal?",9000.0,Alice,5,
