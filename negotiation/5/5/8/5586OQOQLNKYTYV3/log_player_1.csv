"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to come close to my value, and I want to leave myself room for concessions in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  While it is closer than his initial rejection, it is still not worth selling the product at that price. I have 8 more rounds to work with, and I want to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $10,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's offer. I want to see if we can reach a middle ground. I'm also mindful of the limited rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. With 6 rounds left, there's still opportunity to negotiate further and try to get a better deal. Selling to John for $12,000 would guarantee my minimum, but I'm hopeful that I can secure a better deal with Bob in the coming rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm also trying to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway.  $10,000 is a significant compromise, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to accept. With 5 rounds left, I need to find a price point that will satisfy both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. With 4 rounds left, I believe there's still potential to negotiate further and get a better deal. I'm also hesitant to sell to John just yet because there's a good chance I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

With 4 rounds remaining, I'm making a significant concession by lowering my offer to $9,500. This is my final attempt to reach a compromise with Bob before considering selling to John.  This price is closer to Bob's last offer, and hopefully, it will entice him to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds remaining, the negotiation has stalled, and Bob's offers have been stubbornly low.  I've made significant concessions, but it seems he's unwilling to meet me halfway. To avoid risking a deal falling through completely, I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000. This guarantees my minimum value and avoids any further potential losses in these final rounds."
