"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value to both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product at a price of $13,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of you. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,5,
