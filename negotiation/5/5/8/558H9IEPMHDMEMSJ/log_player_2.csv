Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product at a price of $13,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of you. What do you think?

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm starting to run out of time. It's better to buy from John for a guaranteed $12,000 rather than risk further negotiation and potentially end up paying more."
