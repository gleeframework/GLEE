"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll reject Alice's offer because I can get the same product from John for $12,000, which is $500 more than Alice's offer. I'd rather save that extra $500.
