Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This leaves room for negotiation if he tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" I subtly imply the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, I'm not desperate and can afford to negotiate from a position of strength. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is friendly and suggests I'm open to discussing the price further."
