Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price, as it's what the product is worth to me. While Bob might not accept it, I can always back down and offer a lower price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product for $1,000,000.  This is the value Bob assigned to the product, so it's a fair starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is getting closer to a reasonable compromise.  It's better to secure this deal than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for less."
