"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Alice,3,
