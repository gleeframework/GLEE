"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in, for a price that will surely benefit us both.  Let's talk about a price of $950,000.  It's a fair deal, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than your fallback option of buying from John for $1,000,000. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay such a high price. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price in a subsequent offer, allowing you to potentially save even more."
