"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $11,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
