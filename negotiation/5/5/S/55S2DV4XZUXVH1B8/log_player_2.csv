"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $90 is a bit too close to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:** Even though I'm countering low, I'm maintaining a polite and respectful tone to encourage further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $85 is still too high.  We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and I'm aiming to get closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's almost exactly halfway between my previous offer ($70) and her current offer ($85).  This shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards my target.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm emphasizing a collaborative approach to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $77 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $82.  This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $82 is a reasonable price, well below my $100 maximum and a decent saving from Alice's original offer.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic to create urgency. While she *might* be willing to go lower, it's not guaranteed.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. I'd rather secure the product at a good price than risk the deal falling through."
