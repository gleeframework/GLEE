Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it'll be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

Bob is insistent on $80, and I've already countered once. I'm not willing to go lower, so I'll sell to John for the guaranteed $80."
