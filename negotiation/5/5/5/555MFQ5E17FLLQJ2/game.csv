"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $11,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's closer to my desired price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,750? I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate. $10,750 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need to make a profit on this. How about $10,900? This would be a great deal for both of us.  Think about it - you still get the product for significantly less than its value to you.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, $10,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,550? I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.",10550.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiations.  However,  $10,550 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle once again.  How about $10,750? This gives you a significant discount on the product's worth and would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",10750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $10,600? I think this is the best we can do and still be fair to both of us.",10600.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. But I also need to make a reasonable profit.  I'm sticking to my last offer of $10,750. This is a fair price that gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a profit. If you're not willing to go that high, then I'll have to consider selling to John.",10750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $10,600. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",10600.0,Bob,10,
