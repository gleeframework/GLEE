"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price. However, I am still looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to counteroffer at $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your willingness to negotiate.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,000,000 is unfortunately below what I'm willing to accept at this time.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000.  This still leaves room for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
