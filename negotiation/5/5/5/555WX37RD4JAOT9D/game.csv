"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm happy to consider $75. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $82. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
