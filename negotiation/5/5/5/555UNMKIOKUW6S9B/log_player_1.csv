Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality and craftsmanship of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1200000? I believe this might bring us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
