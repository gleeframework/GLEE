{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price slightly above my minimum value ($12,000) to show I'm serious about selling, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Bob's Value:** Knowing the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, this price is attractive to him. 
* **Negotiation Space:** This price allows for potential counteroffers without risking a deal with John, who represents my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product!  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. I'd accept $13,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Maintain Value:**  $13,000 is still above my minimum of $12,000, so I'm not making a significant concession.
* **Negotiation Continues:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive and gives Bob a reasonable price to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, $11,500 is still below my ideal selling price and leaves me with a smaller profit margin.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a better price for me. He might be unwilling to budge further. 
* **John provides a secure deal:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob that could potentially lead to a lower price or a failed deal.  It's the safest and most reliable option at this point."
