"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $9,250?  This would give you a good deal and still allow me to get a decent price. "", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $9,250 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to sell it to John for $12,000,  Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good deal for me. It's closer to my minimum value of $12,000 than John's offer, and it avoids the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with a lower price."
