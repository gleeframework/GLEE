Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This response does a few things:

* **Shows understanding:** Acknowledges Bob's perspective to maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Signals firmness:**  By stating this is the ""final offer,"" it creates urgency and implies Alice is unwilling to go much lower. 
* **Offers a small concession:**  Coming down by $250 might be enough to entice Bob while still exceeding the John offer.

If Bob rejects this, Alice should seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $11,750 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is the highest price I'm comfortable paying. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

}
```

While it's slightly less than Alice's ideal price and her last counter-offer, accepting Bob's offer of $11,000 is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **Exceeds John's offer:**  $11,000 is still a $1,000 profit compared to John's standing offer.
* **Bob's firm stance:** Bob has been consistently firm at $11,000, signaling this might be his absolute limit. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Pushing further could make Bob walk away, leaving Alice to settle for John's lower offer."
