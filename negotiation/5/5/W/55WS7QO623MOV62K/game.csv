"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $8000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $9000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit tight on my budget.  Would you consider $8500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in your product.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $8500 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $8750. This shows good faith on my part and I believe it's a fair price.  What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,5,
