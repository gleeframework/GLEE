"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum budget.  There's no reason to immediately accept.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $8,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm making a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. 
* **Reasoning:** $8,000 is a reasonable starting point, allowing room for further negotiation.  I'm framing it as finding a ""price that works for both of us"" to keep the conversation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  Alice has moved closer to my price, but there's still room for a lower price.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Rejecting and counter-offering again will see how far Alice is willing to come down.  
* **Seeking a Better Deal:** I'm aiming to get the product for as close to my $8,000 target as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit tight on my budget.  Would you consider $8,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in your product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Approach:**  I'm incrementally increasing my offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Compromise Focus:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness.
* **Maintain Interest:**  I'm reiterating my interest in the product to keep the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $8500 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $8750. This shows good faith on my part and I believe it's a fair price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress Made:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  
* **Close to Target:** $8,750 is very close to my target of $8,000, and the potential savings are worth the small difference.
* **Time Pressure:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. Accepting now avoids potentially getting stuck with a higher price later or having to buy from John for $10,000."
