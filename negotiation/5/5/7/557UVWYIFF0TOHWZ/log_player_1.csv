Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a chance for you to gain a significant advantage."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a profitable deal for you.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth to make the price more palatable and encourage Bob to accept. 

By offering the product at $1,150,000, you leave a potential $50,000 on the table for Bob while securing a $150,000 profit for yourself, which is significantly better than John's offer."
