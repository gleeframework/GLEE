"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within $12,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price possible, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  I'm willing to go down to $14,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This price still gives you a fantastic deal, and it's the closest I can come to meet your needs.  Let's close this deal and make it happen!",14000.0,Alice,5,
