Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) and significantly lower than John's guaranteed offer ($150).
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Offering $140 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $80 but still beneficial for you.
* **Motivating Factor:**  By setting a deadline (implied by mentioning another buyer), you create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
