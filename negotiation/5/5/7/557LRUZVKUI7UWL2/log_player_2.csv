"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still do better. He has a solid backup option with John at $10,000, so there's no need to settle immediately.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his target price of $10,000.  He has a firm backup option with John, so there's no need to rush into an agreement at this point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter again and potentially squeeze out a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,800.  I'm willing to go to $10,250, which is very close to my budget and a fair price for both of us.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,250 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,600. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial asking price, and Bob is now very close to his target price. While $10,600 is a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, it's still a good deal compared to his backup option with John.  Accepting the offer saves Bob the hassle of further negotiation and ensures he gets the product."
