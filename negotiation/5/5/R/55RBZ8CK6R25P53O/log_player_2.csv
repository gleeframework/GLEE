"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $95.** This is a good deal for Bob, as the product is only worth $100 to him.
* **Buying from John for $100 is less favorable** than accepting Alice's offer.
* **Rejecting the offer and counteroffering might lead to a better deal**, but it also risks losing the product to Alice or having to spend more time negotiating. 

Since Bob wants to save as much money as possible and doesn't want to risk losing the product, the best option is to **accept Alice's offer**."
