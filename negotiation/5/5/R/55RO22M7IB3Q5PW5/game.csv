"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This reflects the product's true value while recognizing your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my willingness to compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
