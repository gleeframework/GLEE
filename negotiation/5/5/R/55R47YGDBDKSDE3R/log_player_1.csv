"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob is showing interest and a willingness to negotiate, so I'm going to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 to accommodate your needs, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $1,600,000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer is the best option for me since:

* It's above my minimum threshold.
* It's a quick and secure deal.
* It's likely that further negotiations will not yield a significantly higher offer. 

While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, there's a chance that Bob might counteroffer again in the next round, potentially getting me closer to my desired price. However, the risk of Bob rejecting the counteroffer and leaving me with the less desirable $1,500,000 offer from John outweighs the potential gain."
