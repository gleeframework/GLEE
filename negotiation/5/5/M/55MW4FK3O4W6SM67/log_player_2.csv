"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a one-time price of $15,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm confident you'll find beneficial. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget of $8,000 and John's offer of $8,000.  It makes the most sense to go with John's offer."
