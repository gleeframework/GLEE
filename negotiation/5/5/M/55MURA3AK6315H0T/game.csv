"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1500000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1050000. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the fact that I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment to purchase the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1030000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1030000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be at $980000 or lower. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider other options.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $980000. I'm willing to make one more concession: I'll sell the product to you for $990000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm afraid I've made it clear that I'm willing to pay up to $980000. I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. I'm not interested in paying $990000, as I believe it's too high.",980000.0,Bob,8,
