"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this valuable item at a discounted rate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $75. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is a good start, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $75 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

I'm aiming to get the product significantly below Alice's initial offer. Starting with a lower counteroffer gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed, while still staying below my $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $75 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $72. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, but I think there's still room to go lower.  I'll reject this offer and propose a price closer to her previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle on $68? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 68
}
```

I'm aiming for a price point between my last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $68 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer the product to you for $70. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $70.  At this point, the difference between her offer and my ideal price is small enough that it's not worth the risk of her walking away from the deal. I'll accept the $70 offer."
