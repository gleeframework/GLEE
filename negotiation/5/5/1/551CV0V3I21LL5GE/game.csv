"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and try $725,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $775,000?  This price reflects the product's true value and ensures a win-win for both of us.",775000.0,Alice,5,
