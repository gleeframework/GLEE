Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and might even lead to exceeding your initial goal.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering the product at $15,000, Alice can gauge Bob's level of interest. If he accepts immediately, she knows she could have potentially asked for even more. If he rejects it, she has room to negotiate down towards his perceived value of $10,000. 
* **Safety Net:**  Alice has a safety net in John, ensuring she won't be forced to accept an offer below her minimum. This knowledge empowers her to be firmer in negotiations with Bob."
