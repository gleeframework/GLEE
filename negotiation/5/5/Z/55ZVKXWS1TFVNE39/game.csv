"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $2,300,000 is simply out of my price range.  Given my research and the market value, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a significant gap from my initial asking price.  I'm open to finding a compromise, so I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price better reflects the true value and potential of the product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand you value the product highly, $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find common ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This is a significant step towards your desired price point, and I'm hopeful you'll consider it.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
