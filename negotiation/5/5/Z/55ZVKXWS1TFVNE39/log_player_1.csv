Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $2,300,000 is simply out of my price range.  Given my research and the market value, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is a tempting offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum. I believe there's room for negotiation to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a significant gap from my initial asking price.  I'm open to finding a compromise, so I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price better reflects the true value and potential of the product."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand you value the product highly, $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find common ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This is a significant step towards your desired price point, and I'm hopeful you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer now matches John's offer, and there's no guarantee I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the remaining rounds. Accepting his offer ensures I receive my minimum desired price."
