Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I can still potentially get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
