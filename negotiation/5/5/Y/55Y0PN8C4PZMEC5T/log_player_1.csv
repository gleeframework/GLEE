Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,950,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you be open to something closer to $1,350,000?

You have three options:

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's aiming for a price well below my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which at this point is a better outcome than continuing negotiations with Bob."
