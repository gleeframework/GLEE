"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and interests. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $12,000 for this exceptional item. This offer takes into account both the high quality of the product and the significant value it holds for you personally. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly aiming high knowing your maximum price is likely higher than her valuation. 
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that the price is too high. This opens the door for a counter-offer. 
* While you have John as a backup, it's always better to negotiate for a lower price before resorting to your maximum budget."
