Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already getting more than your minimum value of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $150 that it's worth to Bob, leaving space for a compromise.
* **It shows you're open to a deal:**  The friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

If Bob rejects, you can consider lowering the price slightly or see if he'll counteroffer.  If the negotiation drags on, you can always fall back on John's $100 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $125. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $120 is better than John's offer, it's still below what you believe the product is worth.  You're willing to negotiate, but you're not willing to give up too much.  You'll counteroffer with a price closer to your original offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my original price. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $122.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 122.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $122.50. I'm willing to pay $118 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, you're still confident in the product's value.  You're willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to $120.  You'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price, but not too low that you compromise your own value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $118 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $119?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 119}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable paying $119. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is getting too close to John's offer of $100. While you'd like to get closer to your desired price, the negotiation is taking longer than anticipated.  To avoid further haggling and ensure a reasonable profit, you'll choose to sell the product to John."
