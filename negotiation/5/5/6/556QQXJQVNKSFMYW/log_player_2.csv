"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a valuable product for a price that's significantly below its market value. While it's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This presents a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a considerable discount. Please consider this offer carefully, as I have other interested buyers who are ready to pay full price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a discount from her perceived value, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You can get the product from John for a price that fits within your budget."
