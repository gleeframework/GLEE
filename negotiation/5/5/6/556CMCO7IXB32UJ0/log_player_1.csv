"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to make it more appealing to Bob. 

I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price. If he doesn't, I can always sell to John for $100."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  There are still 9 rounds left, and I can leverage the fact that I have a backup buyer in John. 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still lower than my initial offer. This will show Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
