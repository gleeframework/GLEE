"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've personally valued at no less than $12,000, and I know you're looking for exactly this kind of item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!",12500.0,Alice,1,
