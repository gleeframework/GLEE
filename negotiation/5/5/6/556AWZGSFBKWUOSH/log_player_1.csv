Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000} 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives him room to negotiate. It also leaves some room for me to lower the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum value for the product, but it's closer than his initial rejection. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a price that's fair for both of us. It also leaves some room for potential further concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value for the product.  While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob might take a long time and involve further concessions.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's the best option at this point."
