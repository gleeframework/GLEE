Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $795,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great opportunity for you to own this unique product. What do you think?

It's not worth haggling with Alice any further. She's unlikely to go below $795,000, and John is offering the product for $800,000. It's more efficient to take the guaranteed deal with John at this point."
