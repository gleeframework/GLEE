"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $175 is above your maximum budget of $150. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $160 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $150. 
* You're better off trying to negotiate a lower price again before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $150 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for that price."", ""product_price"": 150}
