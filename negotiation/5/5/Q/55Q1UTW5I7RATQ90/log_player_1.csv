"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and optimistic, highlighting the value of the product.  
* **Strategy:** My goal is to try and get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $120 as possible while still leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation open and avoids a premature rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price slightly to $110. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly,  acknowledging Bob's offer while stating my own.  I'm also suggesting a compromise to encourage a deal.
* **Strategy:**  I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a price closer to my minimum and keeping the negotiation going."
