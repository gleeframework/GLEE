"I'm interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $82.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $78?",78.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $78 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $80?  That way we both get a fair price.",80.0,Alice,5,
