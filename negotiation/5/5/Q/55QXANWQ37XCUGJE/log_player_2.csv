"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,200,000 is way above his target price and he has plenty of time to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price point. There's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to his goal of $1,000,000 or less.  Bob can still buy from John for a guaranteed $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering the value we both see in it. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we work together."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I'm thinking of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject this offer.  While Alice has come down significantly,  $1,050,000 is still above his target price, and he can still buy from John for a guaranteed $1,000,000. There's potential to negotiate further and try to get to his target price of $1,000,000 or less.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident that it's a good deal for both of us. I'm ready to close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
