Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $12,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $10,500?  That's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counteroffer at $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

Alice is very slowly coming down in price and is unlikely to reach a price I find acceptable.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $8,000."
