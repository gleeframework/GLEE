Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
