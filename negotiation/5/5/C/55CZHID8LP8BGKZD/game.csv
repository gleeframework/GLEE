"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $120, which is the absolute maximum I'm comfortable with.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a middle ground. I am willing to consider your offer of $120, but I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. Therefore, I propose we agree on a price of $140 for the product. This allows us to both benefit from the transaction. Please let me know if this works for you.",140.0,Alice,3,
