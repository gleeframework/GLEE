"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This allows for some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a reasonable price.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic in my message to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could accept his offer and get some money, I'm better off trying to negotiate a better price or selling to John for a guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $90 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 132.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but I have a strict budget. Could you do $100? That's all I can justify spending. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance that we won't be able to reach an agreement, and I'm running out of rounds. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's a better choice than risking a further decrease in price or potentially losing the sale altogether."
