Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I believe it's a great deal considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** Since we know Bob values the product at $150, starting at $130 leaves a potential $20 profit for him, making it more likely he'll engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $130 leaves space to potentially go down to $110 or $120 while still making a profit above your minimum.
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being appealing enough to encourage Bob to negotiate rather than immediately going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is a good deal. It's above your minimum acceptable price ($100) and provides a healthy profit. While there might be a slight chance of squeezing a bit more out of Bob, the risk of him walking away and the guaranteed $120 makes accepting the offer the most logical choice."
