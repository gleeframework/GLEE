Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  The minimum you'll accept is $1,500,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to him.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range can be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not price Bob out completely. Since you have a backup offer, you have some leverage. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique features and market potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by emphasizing the product's value.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,450,000 is within the ZOPA, leaving room for negotiation but favoring you.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can negotiate down slightly, but don't go below your $1,500,000 reservation price.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, consider being slightly more flexible with your price."
