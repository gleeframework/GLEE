"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would still give you a great deal, and it's a significant step closer to what I need. Let's work together to make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
