"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2000000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is simply below my minimum threshold. I understand your budget constraints, so I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1750000? It's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I still feel that $1750000 is beyond my current budget. I would like to propose an offer of $1600000. I hope this suggestion is more within your consideration range.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1650000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs. Let me know if you're open to this.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $1625000. This amount strikes a balance between acknowledging the product's value while keeping it within my financial limits.",1625000.0,Bob,6,
