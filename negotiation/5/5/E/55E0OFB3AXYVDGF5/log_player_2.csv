Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $10,500, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,250. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price and potentially save more money. He has the option of buying from John, so he doesn't need to accept a price that's not comfortable."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $10,750.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'll throw in a small concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,800. Let's see if we can wrap up the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still slightly above his target. Bob has the option to buy from John for $10,000, so he can continue to negotiate with Alice and try to get a better price.  He can potentially get the product for less than $10,800."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close.  I'm willing to go up to $10,700.  It's my final offer.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10700}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,700, but I'll throw in an additional concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,900. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $10,000. While she has offered concessions, the price is still too high for Bob. At this point, Bob has a better option - buying the product from John for $10,000.  This saves Bob money and avoids further negotiation."
