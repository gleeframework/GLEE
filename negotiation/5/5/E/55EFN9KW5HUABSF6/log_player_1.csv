I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum price of $80. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a compromise that's mutually agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now above my minimum price of $80, and only slightly lower than what John would pay.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a slightly better price than selling to John."
