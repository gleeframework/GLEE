"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $10000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still early in the negotiation.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  $7,500 is a bold counteroffer, but it shows I'm serious about getting a good price.  This should give Alice room to counter, and we can hopefully find a mutually agreeable price within the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $7500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try and get closer to my target of $7,500.  Rejecting her offer allows me to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $8,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a compromise by increasing my offer slightly. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to negotiate, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my target. It's likely that Alice will either accept this offer or come back with a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
