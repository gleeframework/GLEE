Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** While we know Bob values the product at $80, offering it just above that might insult him or make him suspicious. Offering it significantly lower than our John-backup price ($150) but still leaving room for profit is a good strategy.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, great! If he negotiates, we have some wiggle room. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still maintaining a good chance of securing a deal with Bob."
