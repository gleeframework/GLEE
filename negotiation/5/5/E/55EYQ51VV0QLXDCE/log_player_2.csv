"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate. Since the product is worth $12,000 to both of us, there's room for a better price. Let's see if we can get a lower offer from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is open to negotiation.  $11,000 is still a fair price for her, considering the product is worth $12,000 to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal for me. It's still below my maximum price of $12,000 and represents a savings of $500 compared to buying from John.  I'll accept the offer."
