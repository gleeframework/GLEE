"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, as I know it's worth a lot more to me. This will give me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my target of $1,000,000.  I'll be prepared to lower the price in future rounds if necessary, but I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to the value I place on the product. I am willing to pay $950000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe we can reach a more favorable agreement.  By rejecting his offer, I can continue the negotiation and aim for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of $1050000 for your product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $1,000,000, Bob's offer is now within a reasonable range, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure a deal at $1,050,000 than risk losing the sale completely."
