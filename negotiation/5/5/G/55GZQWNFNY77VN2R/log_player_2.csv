Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go up to $960,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $980,000, but I'm not budging from there. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's final offer is $980,000. This is a good price, and if I reject, I only have one more round to negotiate. It's likely Alice won't budge further, and I'll have to buy from John for a higher price. It's better to accept this offer and save some money."
