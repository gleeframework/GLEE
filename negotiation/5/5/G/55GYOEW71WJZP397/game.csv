"Hi Alice,  $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000,  which is a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
