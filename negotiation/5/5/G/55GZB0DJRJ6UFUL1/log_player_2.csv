"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better deal than $15,000 from John, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting his counteroffer by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates his desire to negotiate and sets a new starting point.  $12,500 is still above Alice's value for the product, leaving room for potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12500 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13250? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can find a way to make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,250 is a better deal than $15,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,250 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by increasing his offer slightly but staying below Alice's offer. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price.  A $13,000 offer represents a reasonable compromise and leaves room for a potential deal."
