We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate further with Bob."

Bob is holding firm at $825,000, and we are getting dangerously close to John's offer.  While we might squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's risky to push further and potentially lose him altogether. Accepting his offer secures a significant profit."
