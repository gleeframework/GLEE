"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to buy from Alice, as the price is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,000. This is a significant increase from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this will show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, while also leaving some room for her to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than her initial price, it's still not great. I'm going to reject this and see if I can get her closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm raising my offer to $9,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest price, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it.  I'll keep trying to negotiate a better price, as I still have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to split the difference between Alice's last offer and my previous offer.  $8,500 is a reasonable middle ground, and hopefully, Alice will accept it. If not, I'll have a few more rounds to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is getting close to my desired price.  I'm willing to accept $7,500 to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal. It's also getting late in the game, and I want to avoid having to buy from John at a much higher price."
