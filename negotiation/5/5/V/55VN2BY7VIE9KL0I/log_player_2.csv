"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I've researched its worth in the current market, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its potential benefits for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is more than Alice values the product, it's significantly less than your $15,000 maximum and cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $3,000."
