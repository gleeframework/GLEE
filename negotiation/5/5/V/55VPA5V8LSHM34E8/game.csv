"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still looking to pay closer to $10,000.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11,000. I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $11,500, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more offer: I'll sell the product to you for $12,000. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
