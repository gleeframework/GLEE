"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's $10,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his $10,000 limit. Bob wants to save as much money as possible and is willing to continue negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11,000. I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $11,500, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more offer: I'll sell the product to you for $12,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has raised her offer back to $12,000, which is more than Bob's limit. It's clear that further negotiation with Alice won't get Bob a lower price. Buying the product from John for $10,000 is the best option to save money at this point."
