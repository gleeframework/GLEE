"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900000 is still too high for me. Considering the potential value, I'd be willing to pay $700000. This is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $820000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's unique features and potential returns. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. While I recognize the product's potential, $820000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $780000, which demonstrates my genuine interest while staying within a reasonable range. Let's see if we can close this deal.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $780000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $810000. This is a compromise that reflects the product's unique qualities and my willingness to negotiate. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down again, but $810000 is still a bit too high. I'm really serious about acquiring this product, and I believe $800000 reflects its value while fitting within my budget. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
