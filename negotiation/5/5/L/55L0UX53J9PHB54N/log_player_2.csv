"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I'll sell it to you for $110. It's a steal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer ($110):**  While lower than her value ($120), it's still more than you want to spend.
* **John's Offer ($80):** This meets your maximum price, making it the better deal. 

You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
