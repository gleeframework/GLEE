"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $10,000 for the product?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,5,
