"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? That's a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? That's the highest I can go.",108.0,Bob,4,
