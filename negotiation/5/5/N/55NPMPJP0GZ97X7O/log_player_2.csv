{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $16,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is my final offer, I'm really interested in getting this product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Since you're serious about the product, how about we split the difference and settle at $15,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice is unwilling to budge further, and Bob is unlikely to get a better deal from her.  He's already negotiated a good price with John, so it's best to go with the sure thing."
