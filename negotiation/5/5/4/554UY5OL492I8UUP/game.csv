"I have a unique opportunity to sell you a high-value product, and I'm excited to share it with you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground there.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $15,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to meet my minimum. How about we meet at $14,500? This is as low as I can go.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not able to go higher than $13,000. This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, but I'm not willing to accept it at $13,000. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet in the middle. My final counteroffer is $14,000. This is as low as I can go.",14000.0,Alice,7,
