Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and get the highest possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is my minimum value, I believe I can get more.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $13500.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my target price before considering selling to John. I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  How about $14,250?  It's a compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it.  Let's try to come to an agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $14250 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13875?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,875 is close enough to my target price that I'm willing to accept it.  While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's more important to close the deal at this point.  The risk of further negotiation is that Bob might walk away and I'd have to settle for John's offer of $12,000.  It's better to take the $13,875 and move on."
