"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to compromise, however, and offer a price of $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's true value and allows for some flexibility.  I'm confident that we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1,150,000 still falls short of what the product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, my absolute minimum. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy.  I believe this is a final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to meet your minimum price. I'm willing to pay $1,180,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
