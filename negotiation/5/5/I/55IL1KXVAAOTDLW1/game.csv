"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However,  $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $9,000? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about paying $9,000. How about we meet in the middle of $9,000 and $8,500? I'd be willing to pay $8,750 for the product. That's as high as I'm willing to go.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on $8,750.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a significant compromise, and it's the final offer I can make.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, as I mentioned before. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8,000",8750.0,Bob,6,
