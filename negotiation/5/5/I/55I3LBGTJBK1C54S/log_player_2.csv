"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  As Bob, I am aiming to save as much money as possible and  $2,250,000 is well above my maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and attempt to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity,  $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, to be candid, $1,200,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm confident that this product can generate substantial returns exceeding your initial assessment. Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000? This price reflects the true potential of what we're discussing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,900,000 is still too high. While she's come down from her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  I'll continue negotiating to try and get a lower price, or I'll move to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your belief in the product's potential, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my genuine interest.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
