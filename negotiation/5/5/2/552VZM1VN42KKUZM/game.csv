"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really keen on this product but I can't go above $95.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're still interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a fair profit. I'll counteroffer at $105. I think that's a good middle ground between our previous offers.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still out of my price range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I've already made a counteroffer at $105, which is closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, so I'll counteroffer at $100. This is my final compromise.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really pushing the limits of my budget here, but I can't go any higher than $90.  It's my final offer.",90.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made a compromise at $100. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll counteroffer at $100, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Alice,9,
