Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a very profitable range.
* **Consider the Alternative:** Knowing John provides a safety net at $800,000,  Alice can be more ambitious with her initial offer to Bob.

This strategy balances ambition with a degree of realism, aiming to secure the best possible deal with Bob while keeping the backup option in mind."
