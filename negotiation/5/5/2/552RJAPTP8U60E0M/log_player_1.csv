Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $10,000 is above your $8,000 minimum, giving you some profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is likely to counteroffer, giving you the opportunity to bargain.
* **It shows you're serious:**  By not starting at a ridiculously high price, you signal that you're willing to negotiate in good faith."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a decent profit, it's still possible to squeeze a little more out of this negotiation. Bob clearly wants the product and has shown he's willing to pay more than my minimum. It's worth seeing if I can get closer to my desired $10,000 price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and $9,000 is definitely a step in the right direction.  However, I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my original offer.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$9,250 is a good compromise. It's higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, but still lower than my ideal price.  However, this is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and the risk of further negotiations getting stuck and leading to a sale to John for $8,000 is too high. It's time to lock in this deal and secure a good profit."
