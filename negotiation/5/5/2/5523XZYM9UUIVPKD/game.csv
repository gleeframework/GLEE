"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll sell it to you for $850000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $825000.  This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our positions. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $825000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $875000. This is my last offer before I reconsider other options.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $800000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850000? This feels like a fair price that benefits us both.  What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to budge further on the price. I'll give you one more chance to meet me halfway. I'll sell it to you for $900000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm getting closer to a price I can accept.  How about we split the difference again and agree on $875000? This would be a fair outcome for both of us.  Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement before we run out of time.",875000.0,Bob,8,
