This offer leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring you make a profit beyond your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $13,000 for it. I hope this revised offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer,  $13,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
