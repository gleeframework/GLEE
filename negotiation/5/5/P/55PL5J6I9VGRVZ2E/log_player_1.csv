Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm offering it to you for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $10,000 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a significant profit margin for you. This price also provides a compelling incentive for Bob to buy now rather than risk losing the product. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's exact willingness to pay. A more aggressive starting price (closer to $12,000) could yield even higher profits but also increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
