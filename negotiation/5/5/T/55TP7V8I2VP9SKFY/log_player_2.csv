"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth exploring other options before accepting the first offer. Since Bob's maximum budget is $12,000, and Alice's first offer is at that limit, it's best to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've had other interested buyers and I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I can meet you in the middle at $11500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get closer to his target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit high at $11,500. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10750. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $11250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his desired price point, it's still above his target. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,000.  I think this would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we do $11250, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to negotiate the lowest price possible. Even though Alice is offering extras, it's still above Bob's target price. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to offer extras, but I'm still stuck at $11,000. That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've been flexible, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm starting to think I might have to consider other options. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $11500. If not, I'll have to explore other opportunities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has been persistent in his negotiation but has reached his limit. Alice's final offer of $11,500 is still higher than his target of $11,000. With only one round remaining, there's a high chance that Alice will not accept any further counteroffers. Given the risk of the deal falling through, Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000 to guarantee the purchase within his budget."
