"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll be the best fit for it. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a little high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $12,500. This is my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. I've already made a concession by offering it to you for $13,000 in the last round. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer it to you for $12,750. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to listen to your response.",12750.0,Alice,5,
