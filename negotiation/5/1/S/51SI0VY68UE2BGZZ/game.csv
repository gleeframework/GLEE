,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can make this work.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $107.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $109?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
