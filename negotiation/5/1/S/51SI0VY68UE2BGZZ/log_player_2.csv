"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating is the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still trying to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is higher than what John is offering.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $107.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 107}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $109?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is still higher than John's price, even though she's come down.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John, saving yourself $9.  There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and you're already several rounds in."
