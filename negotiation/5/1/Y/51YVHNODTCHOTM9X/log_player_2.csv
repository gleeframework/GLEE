"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it would bring to your business.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant discount from her perceived value, it's still more than you want to spend. You know John is a reliable seller who will sell you the product for $800,000.  You're better off aiming for that price."
