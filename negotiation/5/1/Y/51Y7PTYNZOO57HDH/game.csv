,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit out of my budget. How about $85? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make a profit on this product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $95, which is closer to our middle ground. This is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $102? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",102.0,Alice,5,
