Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for much less.  He should counteroffer Alice and see if they can reach a more agreeable price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can get the product from John for a much lower price. It's worth continuing negotiations with Alice, but if she doesn't come down further, Bob should buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to buy it immediately."", ""product_price"": 900000}
