Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing our profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Consider the Alternative:** We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so our offer needs to be significantly higher than that to be worthwhile. 

By offering the product at $925,000, we create a win-win scenario where Bob gets a $75,000 discount from his perceived value, and we secure a significant profit beyond our minimum acceptable price."
