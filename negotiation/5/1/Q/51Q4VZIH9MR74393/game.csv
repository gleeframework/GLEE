"I have a unique and valuable product that I'm excited to offer to you. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I'm willing to consider your interest. My initial offer is $950000 for the product.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. This reflects my understanding of the market value and my budget. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $750000, which would be $850000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value we've both agreed upon. I believe this offer is in both of our best interests.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $860000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",860000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $860000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $820000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price.",820000.0,Bob,6,
