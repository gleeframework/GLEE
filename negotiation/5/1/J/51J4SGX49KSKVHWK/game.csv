"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value it will bring to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings, especially to someone like you, is substantial. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is my best offer and reflects the product's true worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $900,000 for the product. This is my best offer so far.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. However,  $900,000 is just too low for me to consider.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price point. To close this deal now, I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is a firm offer and a final attempt to find common ground.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. This is my best offer so far, and I hope we can agree on this price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
