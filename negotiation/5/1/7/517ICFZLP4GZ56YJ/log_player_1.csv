"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate its features. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm offering it for slightly less than my minimum acceptable price, hoping to get Bob engaged in the negotiation. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still want to try and get a little bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $105?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but not quite there. With only four rounds remaining, I'm worried that I won't be able to close the deal with Bob at a price that's satisfactory to me. I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer, and I'm not willing to risk losing the chance to get my minimum price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
