This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that you're serious about getting a good price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to try and get closer to my target."
