"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $12,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $13,500?  This would give you a great deal and still allow me to get a fair price for my product.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $13,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
