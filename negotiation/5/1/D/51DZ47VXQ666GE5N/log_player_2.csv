"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and the price John offers.  It's in your best interest to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a much better price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $1,050,000 puts you at a point where even if Alice counters, there's a chance of reaching a deal significantly below your $1,200,000 maximum and John's offer.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message remains polite and professional, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. How about $1,250,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and it would be a fair compromise for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above what John is offering. You have some bargaining power left and can try to negotiate a price closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you be willing to close the deal at $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Meeting in the middle at $1,150,000 shows Alice that you are willing to negotiate and move closer to her price point. 
* **Still Below John's Offer:** This counteroffer keeps you below your $1,200,000 maximum and what John is offering, leaving you room to potentially go up slightly if needed.
* **Direct and Clear:**  The message is straightforward and suggests a clear path to closing the deal."
