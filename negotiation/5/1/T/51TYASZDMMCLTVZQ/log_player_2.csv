Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's potential.  While $1,500,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the true value and long-term returns this product can offer. I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm looking for a price point closer to $2,000,000. How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000?

I'll make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my target price.

# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  I'm also eager to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,690,000?  That's a significant concession on my end and demonstrates my willingness to close this deal.
