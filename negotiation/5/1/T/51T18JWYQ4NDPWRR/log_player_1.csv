"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $950,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for, and I still have rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you see value in the product, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price reflects the value I've placed on it and allows room for both of us to be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1025000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,025,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob before resorting to selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,040,000.  This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1040000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $1040000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll counter with $1030000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,030,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I want to push for a higher price and see if Bob will budge."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close to a deal, but $1,030,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our last two offers at $1,035,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1035000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll counter with $1027500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only three rounds left, I'm getting increasingly worried that I won't be able to reach my minimum price with Bob.  The offers are getting closer, but I'm not sure if I can convince him to go any higher.  To avoid the risk of getting a lower price than I want, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This ensures I get my minimum value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
