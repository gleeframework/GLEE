"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has great potential for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $1150000.  This price reflects the value I place on it, and I'm open to discussing it further.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is simply too low for me. I understand you see value in the product, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This price reflects the value I've placed on it and allows room for both of us to be satisfied.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1025000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1025000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1040000.  This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $1040000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll counter with $1030000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close to a deal, but $1030000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our last two offers at $1035000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1035000.0,Alice,7,
