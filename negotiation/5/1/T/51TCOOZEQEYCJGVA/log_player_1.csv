Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him an incentive to negotiate, but it's still below your minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **It shows you're open to a deal:** This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

Remember, you can always go to John if Bob isn't willing to meet your price. But, starting with a reasonable offer might get you closer to your goal of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.** While it's tempting to take the $800,000, it's a big loss for you.
* **You have a guaranteed backup option with John.**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures you get your minimum value. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired amount, potentially getting a better outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

You should now send Bob a counteroffer.  A counteroffer around $850,000 might be a good starting point. This shows you're willing to negotiate but still maintain a reasonable profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $800,000 is a good price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.**  It's clear he's not willing to budge much further.
* **You have a guaranteed backup option with John.** Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures you get your minimum value and avoids further negotiation.
* **The potential gains from further negotiation are not worth the risk.**  There's no guarantee you can get a higher price from Bob, and you could end up with nothing. 

**Conclusion:**

It's time to move on. Selling to John guarantees you a good deal and avoids further time wasted on a negotiation that's unlikely to be successful."
