"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special offer tailored to your needs, considering the value you see in it. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer. You know Alice is willing to sell for $12,000, so you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  Given the value we both see in this product, I believe this price is fair. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $13,000 for the product? This is still above your initial suggestion, while also being a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to your desired price of $12,000, and it's still a better deal than buying from John for $15,000."
