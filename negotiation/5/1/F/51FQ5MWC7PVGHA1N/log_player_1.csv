"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is still above market value and reflects the potential I see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber.  I've done extensive research and analysis on its value, and I'm confident it's worth significantly more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This offer represents a considerable compromise on my end and acknowledges your interest in the product."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We still have room to negotiate and Bob is clearly interested. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit closer to our desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $975,000? This recognizes the value you see while acknowledging my need for a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm still firm on my budget and can only go up to $925,000.  This offer is a significant compromise on my part and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but we're still a significant margin away from our $1,200,000 safety net with John. Let's push a bit further and see if we can get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this deal.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $960,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and reasonable price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 960000
}
``` 

At this point, we're getting close to a point where the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob might be outweighed by the risk of him walking away. Setting a firm final offer gives him something concrete to consider and emphasizes the value of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $960,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $940,000 for the product. This is my final offer and represents a significant compromise. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Bob has also presented his ""final offer"" and the gap between his offer and our minimum acceptable price is still quite large.  While we might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's unlikely to be a significant amount. At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation and losing both Bob and John as buyers outweighs the potential reward. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our desired profit with no further risk."
