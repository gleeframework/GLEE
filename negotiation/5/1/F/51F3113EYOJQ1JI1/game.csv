"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product for $1,200,000. However, that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is within my budget and reflects the value I see in it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1,050,000 is your top limit, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $1,100,000 for the product. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
