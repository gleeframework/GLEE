"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a nice product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a really great deal, and I think it's fair to both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you can't let it go for $90, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $102.50, which is a good compromise. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $100?  That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
