"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than our maximum price. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We are starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This tactic can help us understand her lower limit and leave room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $130 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to our desired price, we still have room to negotiate. We'll reject this offer and counter with a price slightly below her offer to encourage her to move closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice.  How about $110?  That's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

We are moving closer to Alice's price, but still aiming for a price significantly below her initial offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while demonstrating our willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we try $122? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a price we might accept, but we're still not at our target.  We'll reject this offer to see if we can get her even closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand this is a good product, Alice, and $122 is close.  Would you be willing to settle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

We are nudging the price down slightly, remaining persistent without being aggressive. This shows Alice we're serious about the purchase but still seeking a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much. How about we try $118? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $118 is a reasonable price, well within our budget and saving us money compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
