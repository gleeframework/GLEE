"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally transparent, my budget caps out at $800,000.  If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your transparency, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I need a bit more. I'm now offering the product to you at $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to reach your limit, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",820000.0,Alice,7,
