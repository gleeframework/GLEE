"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Can we discuss further?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is getting closer, but it's still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your creative approach, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $1,150,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll meet you at $1,200,000, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to make it work. Can we shake on it?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
