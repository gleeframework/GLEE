Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point in the negotiation.
* **Enthusiasm:** Expressing belief in the product's value for Bob might make him more open to negotiation.
* **Openness:**  I'm not being too rigid with my offer, leaving room for counteroffers and finding a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If the negotiation drags on or I feel like I'm not getting close to my desired price, I can always switch to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be high to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8000 for the product. Could we possibly come to an agreement within this range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  Accepting it would mean losing a substantial amount of money.
* **There's room for negotiation.** While Bob's initial offer is low, his message indicates he's willing to negotiate within a range. 
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed $15,000.**  However, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob first.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but still lower than my initial offer. I'll aim to find a middle ground that's more appealing to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $8,000 is too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. Would you be interested in paying $12,000 for the product?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Openness:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by saying it's ""closer to what I need"".

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. 
* If he rejects, I'll consider if his counteroffer is worth accepting or if I should switch to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  While it's closer than his initial offer, it's still a significant loss for me. 
* **Negotiation is getting tedious.** Bob has already rejected two of my offers, and his final offer suggests he's unwilling to go any higher.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed $15,000.**  This is a secure and reliable option that allows me to meet my minimum price requirement.

**Next Steps:**

* I will sell the product to John for $15,000, as it's the best option available to me at this point."
