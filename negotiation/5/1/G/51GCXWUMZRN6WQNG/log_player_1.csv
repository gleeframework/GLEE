"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $8,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I have 8 rounds left and the potential to get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $8,200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,800 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $9,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I would like to propose an offer of $8,900 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, $8,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm running out of rounds, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob. I'm going to stick to my principles and aim for a price closer to $9,200."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference - how about $9,050? This is a final offer from me. If you're not comfortable with this price, we can unfortunately part ways, but I truly hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9050}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I am willing to go up to $8,950 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to conclude this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the last two rounds and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is too high. There is no guarantee that Bob will accept my next counteroffer, and I could end up with a worse deal than selling to John.  With only two rounds left, it's safer to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
