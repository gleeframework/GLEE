"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference - how about $9,050? This is a final offer from me. If you're not comfortable with this price, we can unfortunately part ways, but I truly hope we can reach an agreement.",9050.0,Alice,7,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I am willing to go up to $8,950 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to conclude this transaction.",8950.0,Bob,8,
