I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's important to recognize that even though I could sell to John for $1,000,000, Bob's offer is still a better deal for me."
