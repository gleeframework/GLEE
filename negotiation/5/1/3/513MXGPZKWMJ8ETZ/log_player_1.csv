I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I don't know Bob's valuation, so I'm aiming for a high starting point to see if I can maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still confident that I can get more. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable value. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. It's unlikely I can get a much better offer from Bob, and selling to John would give me significantly less profit. So I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
