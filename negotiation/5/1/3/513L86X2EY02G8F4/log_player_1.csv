"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's a clear offer:** There's no ambiguity about what you're asking for.

It's important to remember that this is just the first round.  You'll need to adjust your strategy based on how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is still below my minimum:**  I need to make at least $120 to consider selling. 
* **It's early in the negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left to try and get a better price.  Bob clearly wants the product, so I can likely squeeze a bit more out of him. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price closer to $100. I might consider offering a slight discount to $95, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  $95 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's. It shows I'm flexible but still value the product.
* **Positive language:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is ""fair"" and ""a great deal"" to build rapport. 
* **Focusing on value:**  I'm reminding Bob that he'll be ""happy with the product,"" highlighting its worth.

**Strategy:**

By offering a slightly lower counteroffer, I'm hoping to nudge Bob closer to my desired price while still maintaining a positive negotiation dynamic.  We'll see if this offer is accepted or if further rounds are needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $92.50 is still below the $120 I need to make this worthwhile.
* **Room to negotiate:** I have 6 rounds left. I can continue to try to get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price closer to $95. I might offer $94, showing that I'm flexible but not willing to drop below my minimum. I'll also need to think about how to respond to Bob's mention of his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $92.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $94. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet in the middle on this one!"", ""product_price"": 94} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (again):**  $94 is right in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's. It shows I'm flexible and willing to compromise.
* **Emphasize the deal:** I'm reminding Bob that this is ""a great deal"" for him.
* **Addressing budget concerns:** I acknowledge his budget constraints but reiterate that my offer is a fair compromise.

**Strategy:**

By sticking with my desired profit margin and focusing on the value proposition for Bob, I'm aiming to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us. This should help us close the deal before we reach the time limit and I'm forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $93, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $93 is still below the $120 I need to make this worthwhile.  
* **Only 4 rounds left:** While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I still need to get a higher offer.
* **John is a good alternative:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit, and I'm not sure if I can get much higher with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a slightly higher price, perhaps $93.50, to see if I can push Bob just a bit further. If he rejects, I'm leaning towards selling to John in the next round to avoid losing too much time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation and I'm willing to meet you halfway once more.  How about $93.50? This is a very fair price for both of us. If we can agree on this, we can both be happy."", ""product_price"": 93.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $93.50 is very close to my minimum of $120.  If Bob rejects this, it's likely he won't go higher.
* **Final compromise:**  I'm positioning this as my final offer, hoping Bob sees the value in accepting it.
* **Positive language:**  I'm emphasizing fairness and happiness to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

By offering a slightly higher price and emphasizing a win-win outcome, I'm aiming to close the deal with Bob before we run out of rounds and I'm forced to sell to John.  We're almost there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $92.50, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're down to our last two rounds. There's not much time left to negotiate.
* **Bob is not budging:** He's consistently offering a price below my minimum.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $120, which is more than I'm likely to get from Bob.

**Strategy:**

With only two rounds left, I don't have time to risk a further decline in the offer. Selling to John ensures I get my desired profit and avoids the risk of losing money with Bob."
