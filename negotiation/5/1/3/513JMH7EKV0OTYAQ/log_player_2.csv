"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, giving you a significant return on investment while ensuring I receive a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a much lower price. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than Alice's minimum value of $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still represents a significant gain for you, and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price,  $1,050,000 is still more than Bob wants to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and  Bob should try to get the price even lower before resorting to buying from John."
