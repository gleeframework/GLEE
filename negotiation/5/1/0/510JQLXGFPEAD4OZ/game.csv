"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1500000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm looking to secure a price that's closer to my maximum budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. Considering our previous discussion and the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1150000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth while also being closer to your desired price. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
