Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I can offer it to you for $16,000.  This price reflects the value you'll get from it. Let's see if we can close this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $14,250?  This price acknowledges the value of the product and is within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250.

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to work with me.  I'm very close to accepting, but $14,500 would be a much more agreeable price point for me.  I'm confident that at this price, we can finalize the deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice seems firmly set above $14,000.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a little further, it's unlikely you'll get a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $10,000. Cutting your losses and going with John ensures you get the product at the best possible price."
