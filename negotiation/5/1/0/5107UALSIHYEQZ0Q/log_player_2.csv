"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than Alice's value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his maximum as possible.  Offering $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and might be enticing enough for her to consider.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum of $10,000. He has more rounds available and should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $10,500. If you're willing to come down a little further, we can reach an agreement. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer, showing his determination. He emphasizes that he's serious about buying but needs a lower price. This approach puts the pressure on Alice to make the next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your budget. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, he still has some leverage. He's already shown a willingness to walk away, and Alice is clearly eager to make a deal.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to push for a price closer to his $10,000 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,750 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but he's still trying to save money. Offering $10,750 shows that he's willing to compromise while also showing that he's not desperate. This offer might be tempting enough for Alice, especially with limited rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you even closer to your budget. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,900. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best possible price.  While $10,900 is within his budget, he can potentially save an additional $900 by continuing to negotiate.  With only 3 rounds left, there's still a chance that Alice will need to drop her price further to secure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I truly appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still just a little bit over my budget. I'm prepared to pay $10,800 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise.  If you're willing to accept, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to move on."", ""product_price"": 10800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to his maximum, but still trying to save a bit more. He's increasing his offer from the previous round, showing that he's willing to compromise, but also reminding Alice that he has other options if she doesn't accept. With only two rounds left, this might be the final opportunity to secure a deal for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at the wire. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,850. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,850 is tempting, Bob only has one round left to negotiate. With limited time, it's not worth risking a deal falling through. Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees Bob the product at his maximum budget.  It's a safe and certain choice, even if it means missing out on a slight potential saving."
