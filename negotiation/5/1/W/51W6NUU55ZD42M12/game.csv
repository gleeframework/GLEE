"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12,000.  It's worth a lot to you, and I think this price reflects that value while still being fair to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  I'm genuinely interested in the product, and I think this price would be a good starting point for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
