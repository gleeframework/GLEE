"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000, knowing I can always go down. This gives me room to negotiate and also signals the product's value.  I'm optimistic about closing a deal with Bob, but I'm also prepared to move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2000000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay $800000, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I will counteroffer and try to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1600000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $1200000. This is a fair price that respects both our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, and I'm confident I can get closer to that with a counteroffer.  John is always an option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and should be within your budget. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're getting closer, but $1400000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to offer $1300000, which is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm not going to settle for less than $1,400,000 without exploring all possibilities."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there!  $1,300,000 is very close to my price point, but I need to make sure this deal is mutually beneficial. How about $1,350,000? It's a small compromise on my end and a great opportunity for you to get this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. I'm ready to finalize this deal at $1325000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this transaction. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value, and we're running out of time. I'm willing to accept his offer and close the deal, as it's still a good return for me and I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds.  While John is always an option, I don't want to miss this opportunity to sell to Bob."
