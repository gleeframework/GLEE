"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a price close to my floor value of $8,000 but leaving some room for negotiation.  This allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, while still securing a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my floor value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my floor value, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I believe there's a chance I can get a better price if I continue negotiating.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can convince him to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $8,750. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired range.  This also puts pressure on Bob to either accept or risk losing the deal if I get another offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is now at my floor value.  However, I've already been through several rounds of negotiation, and I'm running out of time. To avoid risking a complete breakdown in negotiations with Bob, I'll accept John's offer of $8,000. This guarantees me a sale and prevents further risk of losing money."
