"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not quite willing to meet you at $14000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $16000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'd like to propose $15500. Can you consider that?",15500.0,Bob,4,,

"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite willing to go down to $15500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $16500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",16500.0,Alice,5,,
