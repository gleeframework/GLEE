"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential back-and-forth while still leaving a good margin for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still leaves some room for profit for me, but is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500?  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to $11,000. I have several rounds left and I don't want to rush into a deal that doesn't maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  Let's try $10,750.  This is a good middle ground and a fair price for both of us.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement quickly.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,750 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's aim for $10,600. This is a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  I'm hopeful we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, I might end up having to sell to John for $8,000.  $10,600 is a good compromise and a decent profit. I'm going to accept this offer."
