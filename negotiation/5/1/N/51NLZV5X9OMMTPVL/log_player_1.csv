Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a price that works for you. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer, so I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000.
