"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a price that works for you. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer, so I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe you'll find attractive. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
