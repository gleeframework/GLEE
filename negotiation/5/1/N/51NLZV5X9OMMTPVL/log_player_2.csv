# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a price that works for you. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer, so I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe you'll find attractive. What do you think?
