Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This leaves open the possibility for a mutually agreeable deal without losing too much of the value you place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $12,000.  While I would prefer to avoid selling to John, his offer is still a better option than accepting Bob's offer. It's worth exploring if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which still gives you a great deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I am unable to go beyond $8,000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on his offer of $8,000, which is far below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to sell at a higher price, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is that we might not reach an agreement, and I'll end up with nothing. Selling to John at $12,000 guarantees me a good profit and ensures I don't lose out on a valuable sale."
