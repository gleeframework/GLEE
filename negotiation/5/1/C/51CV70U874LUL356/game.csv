"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1250000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1350000.  This price still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us and I believe it reflects the fair market value. Let's work together to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1350000 is closer to where I want to be, I'm still not quite there yet.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1300000.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
