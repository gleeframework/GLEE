Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $95, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $105, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $100. She's consistently aiming for a price above your maximum budget.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $100, ensuring you get the product at the best possible price for you."
