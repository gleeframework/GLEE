"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100) to leave some room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by expressing confidence in the product's value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum selling price of $100.  I need to try to get closer to that number before accepting.  I'm not going to sell to John yet because I believe there's still room for a profitable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm trying to compromise by moving closer to Bob's price while still maintaining a profit for myself. I'm also emphasizing that I'm open to negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum selling price of $100.  It's getting late in the negotiation process, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $90."
