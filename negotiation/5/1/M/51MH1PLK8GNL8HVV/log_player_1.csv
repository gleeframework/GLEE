Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be comfortable with the price.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,050,000 is too low for me. I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1250000. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is closer to my bottom line, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $1,200,000. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still too low. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,175,000? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've had a few rounds of negotiations with Bob, and while he's willing to negotiate, he's not coming up to my desired price point. To avoid further delays and ensure I get a reasonable price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
