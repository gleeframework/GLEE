"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,800,000 is below its worth. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's potential.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,100,000. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,900,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's potential and my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm aiming for a deal that benefits us both. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,000,000. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,900,000 again. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we find a way to meet in the middle again?",1900000.0,Bob,6,
