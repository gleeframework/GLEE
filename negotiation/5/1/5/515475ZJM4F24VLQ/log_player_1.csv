"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,800,000 is below its worth. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's potential."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,100,000. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,900,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's potential and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm aiming for a deal that benefits us both. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,000,000. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,900,000 again. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we find a way to meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could continue negotiating, Bob seems firm at $1,900,000. This is a significant profit above John's offer, and waiting longer carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away entirely.  Accepting now secures a good deal."
