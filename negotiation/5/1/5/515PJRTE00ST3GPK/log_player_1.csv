"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $80 was a bit low. How about we split the difference and do $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is meeting me closer to my price, and while I could push for a little more, $95 is a solid profit. It's better to make the sale now than risk him walking away."
