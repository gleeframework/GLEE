"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $95?  This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $95 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $85.  Would that work for you?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However, $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.",90.0,Alice,5,
