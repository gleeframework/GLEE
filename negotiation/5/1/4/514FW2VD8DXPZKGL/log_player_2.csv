Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $95?  This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However, $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down to $90, which is a good deal considering your alternatives.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and there's always a chance the deal could fall through."
