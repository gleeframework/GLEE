"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than $120 to you. Considering this, I'd like to propose a special introductory price of $150 for you. This is an exclusive opportunity to own this product at a slightly higher value than its worth to you, ensuring you get the best deal possible. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $120.  While she frames it as a ""special introductory price,"" it's still more than you're willing to pay. You have a guaranteed alternative with John for $120, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
