"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?  This price still offers you a great value, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
