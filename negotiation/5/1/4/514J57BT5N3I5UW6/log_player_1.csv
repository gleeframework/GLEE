"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. This will give me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my desired value.  However, I'm aware that John is a potential buyer and his offer is a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,000,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing flexibility.  I believe $1,100,000 is a fair price considering the value to both of us. This should also leave room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000.  I'm aware that I could sell to John for that amount, but I believe I can get a better deal with Bob by continuing to negotiate.  I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price but at a smaller increment. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still believe the product is worth more than $950,000. This price also gives me room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  We're at a crucial point in the negotiation.  I have 4 rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm making a small concession to show I'm willing to meet halfway, but I'm not giving in completely. This keeps the negotiation going while getting closer to my target. If Bob accepts, I'll be able to sell the product for a respectable price. If not, we still have 3 more rounds to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $990,000 is very close to my minimum and John's offer, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I have two rounds left and I believe I can push for a price that's closer to my target.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value of the product and come closer to my price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at my minimum price.  It's time to see if Bob will accept. This is a price that is both fair to me and within his budget.  If he rejects, I'll have to make a difficult decision in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. While $995,000 is a very tempting offer from Bob, it's still below my minimum. I've reached the final round and I don't have time to risk another rejection.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures that I get my desired value for the product.  Although I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, I'm still satisfied with the outcome."
