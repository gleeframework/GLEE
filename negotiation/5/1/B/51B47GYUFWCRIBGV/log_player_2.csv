"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're trying to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still quite a bit above your target. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to buy the product for $750,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and the savings I'm offering you."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price, aiming to get closer to my target of saving as much money as possible. $750,000 is still a substantial amount for Alice, and this offer shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your willingness to negotiate, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my target. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and continue the bargaining process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $825,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $750,000. How about we meet in the middle at $787,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 787500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counter-offering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise that benefits both of us. It's still a good price for me, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $795,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $795,000 is very close to my target price of saving as much money as possible.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a good chance we'll get stuck in a stalemate. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a price that's within my budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal to another seller or running out of rounds."
