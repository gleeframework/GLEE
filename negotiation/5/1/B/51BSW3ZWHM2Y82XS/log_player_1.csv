Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it's worth considerably more to you than my minimum asking price. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product significantly higher than your minimum selling price and John's offer. This presents an opportunity to negotiate a price closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting with a strong offer ($1,300,000) leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a substantial profit above your minimum.
* **Confident Language:**  The message uses confident and persuasive language, emphasizing the product's value to Bob and positioning the offer as a strategic opportunity. 

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring you still have the guaranteed option of selling to John for $800,000 if needed."
