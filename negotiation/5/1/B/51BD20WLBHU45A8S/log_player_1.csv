{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and open to negotiating.
* **Justifying the price:** I mention the ""fair price"" and its value to make my offer seem reasonable.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll wait for his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his proposal. 
* **If negotiations stall:** I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, ensuring I get my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum desired value of $12,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is interested, and I can try to meet him halfway. 
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value. I'll aim to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you taking interest in the product. While $7,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal happen. This price still reflects the value of the product while also being closer to your budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating value:** I emphasize the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:**  I keep the tone friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation going.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good price, while still getting a better deal than his initial offer.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his next offer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John.
* **If negotiations stall:**  I'll move forward with selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,500 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Limited negotiation potential:**  While Bob seems interested, he's not willing to budge significantly from his low offer.  
* **Guaranteed deal with John:**  I have a sure thing with John, who's willing to pay my desired price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially getting a worse deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll take the safe option and sell the product to John for $12,000. This ensures I get the best possible outcome for myself."
