"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with a fair offer. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. $110 is still a bit high, and you have 9 more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down from $120. I'm looking to spend a bit less though. How about $105?  That seems like a fair price considering my value for the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our goal to maximize earnings, how about we agree on a price of $107 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $107 is closer to your desired price, it's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay. You have more rounds to negotiate, and you can still try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $106?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $106.50 for the product? This would be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to a price that's very close to what you're willing to pay, and you've already rejected her previous offer. It's a good idea to accept her offer, especially since you only have 5 rounds left to reach an agreement."
