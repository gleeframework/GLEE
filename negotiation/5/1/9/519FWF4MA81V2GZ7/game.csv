"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. I'm confident you'll see the benefit of this acquisition, and I'm open to discussing it further.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 simply isn't a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $975000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
