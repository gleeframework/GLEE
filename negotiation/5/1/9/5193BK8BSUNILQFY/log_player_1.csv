Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above $925,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

We're still in the early stages of negotiation. While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we have room to negotiate and aim for a better outcome.  We're not in a hurry, so there's no need to settle for $850,000 just yet."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is definitely getting closer to a price point we can work with, but we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit higher. We'll aim for a price closer to $900,000 in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. What if we settle at $875,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  We're moving closer to Bob's offers but remaining firm. By stating it's our final offer, we add a sense of urgency.
* **Strategic concession:**  A $12,500 decrease from our previous offer shows flexibility but not desperation. 
* **Closing opportunity:** This offer gives Bob a chance to secure a price significantly lower than our opening while still being profitable for us."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $875,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob is not showing significant movement towards our price, even after we presented our ""final offer"". 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. The difference between Bob's current offer and John's is substantial.
* **Time Sensitivity:** We're running out of rounds, and there's no guarantee Bob will meet our desired price. Accepting John's offer ensures a profitable and immediate outcome."
