Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  Here's why:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  $14,000 is significantly more than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so a $14,000 offer is still within his perceived value. This increases the likelihood he'll accept.

By offering this price, you create a good chance of getting a higher price while still having a backup plan in case Bob rejects the offer."
