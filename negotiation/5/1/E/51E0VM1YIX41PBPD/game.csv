"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $20,000 is closer to its actual value.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $16,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Let's make this happen â€“ I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This is my final offer, as it's already a significant discount.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,500 is still pushing it for me.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would $12,750 work for you?",12750.0,Bob,6,
