Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my minimum price of $15,000. This shows I'm open to negotiation and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is positive and friendly, hoping to build rapport with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! I've made a successful sale.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject, or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $13000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer, $11,000 is still below my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for higher counteroffer:** I believe I can push for a higher price by making a counteroffer. I'm willing to risk some time in negotiations to try and get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between his offer and my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to work with you.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strong Argument:** I'm highlighting that this price is a ""good price for both of us"" to appeal to his sense of fairness and make him feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my desired value.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to consider his counteroffer. If it's significantly lower, I might have to accept John's offer to avoid losing too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum of $15,000, but it's still significantly lower.
* **Time is money:** Further negotiation with Bob is likely to take more time and might not yield a significantly higher price. 
* **Guaranteed sale with John:**  John is offering me my minimum price, guaranteeing a quick and secure sale.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $15,000. This is the best outcome for me, as it ensures I get my minimum price and avoids any further negotiation risks."
