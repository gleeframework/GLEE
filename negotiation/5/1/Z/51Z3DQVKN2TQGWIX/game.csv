"Hi Bob, it's a pleasure to connect. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value,  $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $1,900,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we possibly settle around $1,450,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,675,000? This represents a significant movement on my end and feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1675000.0,Alice,5,
