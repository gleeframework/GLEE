Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, I want to get as close to that as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering it slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,350,000) might seem like a good deal and discourage him from countering. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  The phrase ""one-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 with John, so I'm not desperate. This allows me to aim high with Bob."
