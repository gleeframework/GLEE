{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than the product's value to Bob, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that's good for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd rather sell to him than John, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit high for me. How about $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is close to my minimum price, and it's better than selling to John for $120. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
