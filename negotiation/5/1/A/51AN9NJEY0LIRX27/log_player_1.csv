Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to $1,200,000 without pushing Bob to the point of rejecting the offer.  

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its significant worth. "", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing exclusivity and value. 
* **Price:**  $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion ($150,000) of the potential profit margin.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start a little lower (but above your minimum).
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you could consider a price slightly closer to the middle ground.

**Remember:**  This is just one approach. Negotiation is dynamic, and you can adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
