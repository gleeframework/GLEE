Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go any higher than my previous offer of $1,015,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,015,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting very close to the end of the negotiation rounds and Bob is unwilling to budge. I've already rejected his final offer, and if I reject it again, I risk losing him entirely.  Therefore, selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best option at this point. It secures the highest possible price for the product."
