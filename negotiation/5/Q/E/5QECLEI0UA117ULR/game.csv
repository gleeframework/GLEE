"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm confident it's worth far more than its initial valuation.  To kick off our discussion, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. This allows for a fair and mutually beneficial outcome for both of us.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $1,600,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. How about we bring it down to $900,000?  This offer reflects the true value I see in the product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value,  $900,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential for generating returns. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's inherent value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $1,175,000?  I believe this is a fair offer that takes both of our positions into account.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While your offer is tempting, I'm still holding firm on the value this product brings.  To meet you closer to your proposal, I can come down to $1,325,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product and the benefits it offers you.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your valuation, but $1,325,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,200,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's more than fair considering your initial asking price.  Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
