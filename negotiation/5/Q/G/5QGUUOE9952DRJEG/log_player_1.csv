Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""its value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth the asking price, even though Bob may value it lower.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""I believe this is a fair price"" and ""What do you think?"" signal to Bob that Alice is open to discussing the price further. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being reasonable enough that Bob doesn't immediately reject the offer."
