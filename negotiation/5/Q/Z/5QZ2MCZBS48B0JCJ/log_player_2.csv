"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. While $1,100,000 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  You have room to negotiate since Alice values the product at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. It's a starting point for negotiation, and we can see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, at this point, it's not worth the risk.  If you reject this offer and counter, there's a chance Alice will walk away, leaving you with only the option of buying from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
