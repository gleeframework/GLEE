"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $950,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product sits significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market conditions and the product's value.",925000.0,Bob,4,
