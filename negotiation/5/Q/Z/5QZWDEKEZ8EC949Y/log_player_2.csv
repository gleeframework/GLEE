"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is pretty close to her perceived value of the product.  There's room for negotiation here. It's too early to buy from John at $10,000 because we might be able to get it for less from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,500?"", 
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This gives us room to negotiate upwards and still potentially stay below our $10,000 limit.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses continued interest in the product while clearly stating our budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** Alice came down significantly, but it's still slightly above our fallback price with John. 
* **More room to negotiate:** With 7 rounds left, we have time to push for a better deal and see if we can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $10,200 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Would $9,250 be possible?"",
""product_price"": 9250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):** We're aiming for a price roughly between our last offer ($8,500) and Alice's counteroffer ($10,200). This shows willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Strategic Timing:** We're now past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. It's a good time to gradually increase our offers to signal to Alice that we're serious but still budget-conscious."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,250 is still a bit of a stretch for me. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,800. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:**  While Alice is getting closer to our target price, $9,800 is still a significant amount more than our $10,000 fallback option with John.
* **Limited Concessions:** Alice's counteroffer suggests she might be getting close to her lowest acceptable price, but we haven't seen much movement.
* **Time Remaining:** We still have five rounds left, allowing us some leeway to see if we can nudge Alice closer to $9,500 or less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle this right now at $9,500?  I'm ready to close the deal if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer represents a reasonable compromise and is directly in between our last offer and Alice's counter. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating we're ready to close the deal, we signal that this is our best offer and we want to avoid dragging out the negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  While we haven't revealed our fallback option with John, implying that we have other options could encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I need to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,700. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Savings:** While we could continue negotiating, Alice's offer is only $200 more than our fallback option with John. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're down to the last few rounds.  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice becoming less flexible, and we might end up paying John's $10,000 anyway.
* **""Good Enough"" Principle:** $9,700 is a reasonable price for the product, and it's significantly less than Alice's initial offer. Sometimes it's better to secure a good deal than risk losing it by pushing too hard."
