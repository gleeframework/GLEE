Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $14,000 is still within Bob's budget, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $14,000 is more than your minimum of $15,000, giving you room to negotiate. 
* **It's a clear starting point:** The message is friendly and outlines the offer clearly. 

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price. You can always fall back on selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob is willing to pay a premium, his offer is still below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** There's a $1,500 gap between Bob's offer and my minimum. This indicates there's still room to negotiate a price that benefits both of us.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, I can always sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I meet my minimum.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my minimum, but still within the range that might be acceptable to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. Considering your interest and the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  $13,000 is only $2,000 below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more:** It's unlikely that Bob will go any higher than his current offer of $13,000. 
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed sale. However, the negotiation is progressing and this is a good opportunity to close the deal. 

**Conclusion:** I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer because it's a fair price and it ensures a quick sale. While I could potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate, it's not worth the risk of losing the sale altogether."
