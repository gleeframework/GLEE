"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $8,500 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it can make a real difference for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  It's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but $9,500 is still too low for me to consider. This product is truly top-notch, and I believe you'll see a significant return on your investment.  How about we settle on $11,500? This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for your product, but $11,500 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's close this deal and I promise you won't regret it. ",10000.0,Bob,6,
