"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While your product is appealing, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000, reflecting the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we've decided to adjust our offer slightly. We would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. We believe this reflects its true value while remaining competitive. We look forward to your consideration.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me, however.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This would still be a good deal for you and allows me to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
