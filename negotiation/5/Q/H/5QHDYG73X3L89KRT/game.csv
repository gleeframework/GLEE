"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's split the difference and make this happen.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and drop my price to $12,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Bob,6,
