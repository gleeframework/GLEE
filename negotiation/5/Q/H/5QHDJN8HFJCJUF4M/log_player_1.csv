"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer,  $950,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm aiming to capture as much value as possible in the initial stages of the negotiation.  I'm also leaving room for potential concessions in later rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, dropping to $750,000 is a significant decrease from my initial offer and a substantial loss for me.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to try to get closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $875,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to accept it.  While I initially hoped for a higher price, I'm also mindful of the limited rounds and the risk of losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer secures my desired value."
