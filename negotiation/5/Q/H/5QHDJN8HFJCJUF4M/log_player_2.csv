"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth accepting Alice's offer since it's significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping to see if Alice is willing to negotiate, and this price gives us a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high.  I'll reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to offer Alice my maximum price of $800,000. This is the same price as John's offer, so it's a good compromise.  If Alice doesn't accept, I'll just buy it from John."
