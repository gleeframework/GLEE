Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm also aware that Bob values the product less than me, so I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is better than my minimum, but I'm not happy with it. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm getting closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm running the risk of a longer negotiation and potentially ending up with a price I'm not happy with.  John offers a guaranteed price that is right at my minimum.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John."
