"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about we aim for $1,250,000 for the product? I think this is a fair compromise considering its value.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to suggest a price closer to my budget. How about we aim for $1,400,000 for the product? I believe this is a reasonable compromise given the value of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Let's try $1,500,000. It's a fair compromise for both of us, and it's the last offer I'll make.  If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
