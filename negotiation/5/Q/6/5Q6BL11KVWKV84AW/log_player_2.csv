"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her value, it's still higher than your maximum budget. It's always worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming to push for a more favorable price. This aggressive starting point gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed.  Since we have a backup option with John, we can afford to be a bit bolder with our initial counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, even though she has lowered the price. Buying from John at $1,000,000 saves me $50,000 compared to accepting Alice's offer.  While there's always the chance Alice might come down further, I'm not willing to risk losing time and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
