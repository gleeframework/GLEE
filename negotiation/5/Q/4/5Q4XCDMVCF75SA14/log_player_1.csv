Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly above your minimum:**  $120 is a good margin over your $80 minimum, meaning you'll still make a decent profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** $120 is less than the $150 Bob values the product at, giving him room to feel like he's getting a deal.
* **It opens the door for negotiation:**  This price point is high enough to make you comfortable, but low enough to encourage Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly sees the value in the product, and a counteroffer may allow you to reach a price closer to your desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This counteroffer strikes a balance:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  You're demonstrating that you're not willing to settle for his initial price.
* **It's still lower than your original offer:** This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **It's close to your ideal price:** $110 is only $10 away from your desired $120, making it a potentially acceptable price point for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer. While $105 is less than your ideal price of $120, it's still a decent profit and considerably better than selling to John for $80.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's becoming increasingly likely that Bob won't budge further. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
