"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low.  How about we split the difference and I offer the product to you for $8,500? This is still a great price for you, considering its worth to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $7,750?  That feels like a fair deal to both of us.",7750.0,Bob,4,
