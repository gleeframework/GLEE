"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price, closer to Alice's value of $8,000.  It's worth seeing if we can get a better deal before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for us to meet in the middle. 
* **Gauging Alice's Reaction:** This offer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. If she's open to negotiation, we might be able to get a very good deal.
* **Backup Option:**  We always have the option to go with John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low.  How about we split the difference and I offer the product to you for $8,500? This is still a great price for you, considering its worth to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, but not there yet:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, which is a good sign. However, $8,500 is still closer to her desired value than ours.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We have seven rounds remaining, and Alice seems willing to negotiate. Let's try to nudge the price closer to $8,000.  
* **John as Backup:** John's offer remains a viable alternative if the negotiations with Alice stall or become unreasonable."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $7,750?  That feels like a fair deal to both of us."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still moving the price in a favorable direction.  
* **Psychological Advantage:** Suggesting a specific number like $7,750 (instead of just saying ""a bit lower"") might make it seem more appealing and reasonable to Alice.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're still early in the negotiation, but it's good to keep the pressure on by making steady progress towards a deal."
