"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $14,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $15,000. That's the minimum I can sell it for. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, like a free consultation and a warranty. How about we meet at $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but $14,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500.  Let's close this deal. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the outcome.",13500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not making any more concessions after this. It's either $14,000 or we walk away.",14000.0,Alice,7,
