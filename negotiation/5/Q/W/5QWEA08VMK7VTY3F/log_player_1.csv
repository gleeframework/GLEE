Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good deal. I'm confident I can get a higher price, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,200,000. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still ensuring I get a decent price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to go lower than $1,200,000. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
