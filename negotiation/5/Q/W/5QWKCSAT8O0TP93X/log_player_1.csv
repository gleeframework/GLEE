Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could secure a quicker sale and still yield a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a price point that allows Bob to perceive potential gain (saving $50,000 from its perceived value to him) while still giving you a substantial profit margin. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster."
