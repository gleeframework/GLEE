Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After considering the value of the product, I'm willing to sell it to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $1,500,000}

Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. Since I'm not willing to sell the product for anything less than $1,200,000, I'll choose option 1 and accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
