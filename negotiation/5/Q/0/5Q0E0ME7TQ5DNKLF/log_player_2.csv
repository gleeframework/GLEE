"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her perceived value, you have a better alternative: buying from John for $1,000,000. This saves you $200,000 and ensures you stay within your budget."
