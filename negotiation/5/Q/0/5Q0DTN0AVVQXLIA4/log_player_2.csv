"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really love it, but I need to let you know that I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's.  Since you want to save as much money as possible, there is no incentive to accept Alice's offer. By rejecting, you might have the opportunity to negotiate a lower price with Alice later or find another seller offering a better deal."
