"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000.
