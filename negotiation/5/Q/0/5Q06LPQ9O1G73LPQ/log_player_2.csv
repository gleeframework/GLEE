Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a significant jump in your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $780,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's clear Alice is sticking around the $825,000 mark.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price without risking the deal.  Accepting at $825,000 secures a good price well below your $1,500,000 maximum."
