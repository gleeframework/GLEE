"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $112? This would be a fair price for both of us.",112.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $108 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and settle at $110? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to pay $107 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",107.0,Bob,6,
