Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $112? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112}

I'm still holding out for a better price than $108.  I want to see if I can get Bob to go a bit higher before I resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $108 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and settle at $110? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to pay $107 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $107 is too low, and I'm concerned that we're getting further away from a deal, not closer.  At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
