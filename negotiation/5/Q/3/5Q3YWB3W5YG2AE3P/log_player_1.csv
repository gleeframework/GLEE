Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but still lower than what I would get from John.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing profit:**  While $1,750,000 is less than my ideal price of $1,500,000, it's still a significant profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By setting the initial offer higher, I create room for negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to my ideal range.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  Offering a price that's appealing enough to Bob gives me a chance to sell the product without resorting to John's offer.

This strategy is a balance between trying to get the best price and ensuring that a deal is made."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd get from John. I am not desperate for a sale and want to see if I can push for a better price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he rejected my initial offer.
* **Minimizing loss:**  Even if the negotiation fails, I have a safety net of $1,500,000 from John, so I can afford to be slightly more demanding.
* **Testing Bob's willingness:** Rejecting Bob's offer will show him that I'm serious about my asking price and am not willing to settle for significantly less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $1,400,000. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding middle ground:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a significant profit margin. 
* **Assessing Bob's commitment:**  If Bob accepts this offer, it shows he's serious about acquiring the product. If he rejects, it might indicate he's not willing to pay much more than his initial offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I retain some negotiating power and potentially push for a higher price in subsequent rounds.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between securing a deal and maximizing my profit, while also keeping in mind the potential for a better offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal with Bob entirely outweighs the potential gain of squeezing out a few more dollars. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing risk:**  John's offer guarantees me a substantial profit and ensures I don't lose out on the sale altogether. 
* **Time and energy:**  Negotiating with Bob is becoming time-consuming and potentially stressful. I'd rather secure the deal with John and move on to other opportunities.
* **Prioritizing certainty:**  John's offer is a sure thing, while the outcome of further negotiations with Bob is uncertain.

Given the situation, selling to John is the most logical choice, as it minimizes risk, saves time and effort, and guarantees a satisfactory profit."
