"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for potential negotiation without immediately sacrificing too much of my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will either accept or counter with a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value.  While I would prefer a higher price, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or no sale at all."
