"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you, but I'm open to negotiations. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm ready to offer $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $11,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",11250.0,Alice,5,
