Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

This offer is a starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This allows me to maximize my potential earnings while also demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is lower than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm not eager to settle for this price, as I believe I can still do better. I'll try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm reducing my initial offer slightly to $1,400,000, still leaving room for negotiation but showing that I'm willing to compromise.  This counteroffer is a good middle ground, demonstrating flexibility while keeping my potential earnings higher than Bob's current offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price and we are getting close to the end of the negotiation.  While I would like to push for a higher price, there is a risk that Bob might walk away completely, and I would be left with only John's offer. Accepting this offer is the most sensible option, ensuring a profitable sale while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
