"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a valuable asset that I know will be worth a lot to you.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this valuable product.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,350,000? I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $1,350,000 is less than Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is getting closer:**  Alice has already moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, indicating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob rejects this offer and counteroffers again, there's a risk Alice might get frustrated and walk away, leaving Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting this offer, Bob gets the product for a good price while minimizing the risk of losing out on the deal."
