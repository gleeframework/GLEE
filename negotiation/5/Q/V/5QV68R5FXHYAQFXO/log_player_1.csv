Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,250,000.  That's a fair price given the value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
