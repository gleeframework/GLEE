Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You are not starting at your minimum price, leaving room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Is attractive to Bob:** The price is still below Bob's perceived value, making it a potentially good deal for him.
* **Allows you to potentially earn more than selling to John:** You're trying to get closer to your desired price of $1,500,000. 

Remember, you can always adjust the offer based on Bob's response, and you have the option to sell to John if negotiations stall or don't reach a satisfactory price for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1100000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value of $1,000,000, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try to negotiate a higher price. You can potentially earn more by continuing the negotiation, and you have the fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's a bit too low for me. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates you're willing to negotiate, while still being above Bob's offer.
* **Find a middle ground:**  $1,150,000 is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  It shows Bob you're serious about selling to him, but not at any price."
