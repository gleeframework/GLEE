While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can use this opportunity to test the waters and see if I can push for a slightly higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal possible, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,220,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this work.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, we are now in round 6. With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to consider the risk of losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price. Accepting Bob's offer of $1,225,000 secures a deal that's higher than what John is offering and is a reasonable compromise."
