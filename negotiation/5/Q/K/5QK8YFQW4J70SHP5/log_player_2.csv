"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's in your best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. This is a strong opening counteroffer that signals my seriousness but leaves no room for further negotiation on my end.  If Alice rejects this, I'll move to John, as the offer is too high for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. While it's closer to what I'm willing to pay, it's still a risk to continue negotiating. I've already made my maximum offer, and there's a strong chance she'll reject any further counteroffers.  It's safer to go with John, as his offer is within my budget and guarantees a purchase."
