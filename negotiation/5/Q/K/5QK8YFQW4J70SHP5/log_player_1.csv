"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob won't accept it. This is a negotiation tactic to establish a starting point and gauge Bob's willingness to pay.  I'm hoping to get closer to my $1,000,000 minimum without losing too much time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum target of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer to try and secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000, my absolute minimum. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and agree to this price.  It's a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still a reasonable amount considering my needs."
