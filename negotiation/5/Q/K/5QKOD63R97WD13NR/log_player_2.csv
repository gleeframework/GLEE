"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, as there's potential to get a better price."
