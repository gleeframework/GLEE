"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering your value of the product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This recognizes its value while offering you a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  This price would allow both of us to make a reasonable deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
