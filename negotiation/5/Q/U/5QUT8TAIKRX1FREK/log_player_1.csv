Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1000000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950000 is still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $900000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. $900,000 is a good compromise, and it's getting closer to my minimum price. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether."
