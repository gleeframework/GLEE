"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target price of $800,000. While it's closer, Bob can still try to negotiate a better price.  It's also important to remember that Bob has the option to buy from John at any point for $800,000, so he doesn't need to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 900000}
