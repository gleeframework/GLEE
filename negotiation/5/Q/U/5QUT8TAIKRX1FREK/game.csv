"Alice, $1000000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950000 is still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $900000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal today.",900000.0,Bob,4,
