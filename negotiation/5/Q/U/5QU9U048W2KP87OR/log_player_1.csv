Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $175. This is above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my minimum of $150, especially since I have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price to $140. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this compromise will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not willing to go lower.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. While it's not the best I could have gotten, it's more than I'd get from Bob, and it guarantees I meet my minimum profit target."
