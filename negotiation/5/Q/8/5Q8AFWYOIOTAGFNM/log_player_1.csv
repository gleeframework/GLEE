I'm going to reject Bob's offer, even though it's my minimum.  I think I can get more from Bob, especially since it's so early in the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, $160 is a good price and it's getting late in the negotiation.  I don't want to risk losing him and having to settle for John's offer."
