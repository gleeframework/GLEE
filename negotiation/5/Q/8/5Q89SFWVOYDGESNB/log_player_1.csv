{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit margin, while still leaving some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  It's also above John's offer, so I'm not losing out on a sure sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's tempting to accept as it's still above John's offer, I'm going to counteroffer to hopefully get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately it's too low for me. Given the product's value and my own investment in it, I can't go lower than $10,500.  This is still a great price for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than it's worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
