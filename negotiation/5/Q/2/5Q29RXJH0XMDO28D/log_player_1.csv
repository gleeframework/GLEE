Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value,"" I'm implying it's worth more than Bob might think, potentially justifying the high price.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning I'll list it publicly, I'm subtly letting Bob know there's another potential buyer (even if it's not explicitly John). This creates a sense of urgency and competition. 

**Important Note:** Even though John offers $15,000, aiming higher with Bob first is a strategic move. If Bob accepts, I get a better price. If he rejects, I can still sell to John at my minimum."
