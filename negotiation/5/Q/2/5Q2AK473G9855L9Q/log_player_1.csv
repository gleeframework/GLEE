I'm willing to make you a one-time offer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has value, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.
