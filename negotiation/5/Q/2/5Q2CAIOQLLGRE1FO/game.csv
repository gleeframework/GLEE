"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it from you if we can come to an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $15000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16500. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget of $12000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14000? I think that's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm not willing to go down to $14000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $16000. It's still a great value, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
