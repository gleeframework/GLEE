"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. However, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential compromises later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $120 for your product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I could accept and make a small profit, I want to see if we can reach a better agreement. I will counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my initial proposal of $120. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is being stubborn and sticking to his initial low offer.  While selling to John for $150 would be a guaranteed profit, I believe I can still push for a better price with Bob.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but I'm starting to feel pressure to make a deal soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $120 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I still need to make sure I'm compensated fairly for this product. Let's come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $135 is closer to my desired price, I still feel that $120 would be a fair price for both parties involved. I hope you can consider this final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is being very persistent with his low offer.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of rounds and I'm not confident we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with.  To ensure a profit and avoid the risk of losing the deal completely, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
