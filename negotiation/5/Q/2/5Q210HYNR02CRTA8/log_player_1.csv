"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. I'm also hoping that he doesn't immediately reject the offer and gives me more information about his valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $8,000. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I want to see if he's willing to move closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500, which is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to be flexible. This should give Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $8,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm offering my minimum price of $8,000. This is a firm offer, and I'm hoping Bob realizes he's unlikely to get a better deal. If he rejects, I'm likely to sell to John."
