Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.
