"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. Let's make this happen!",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $800,000.  This would be a fair price considering your minimum and my maximum, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.",800000.0,Bob,4,
