Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) than my minimum ($80). This gives me more room to negotiate and potentially earn closer to his valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  Offering $100 leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. It also encourages him to accept the offer if he values the product highly enough.
* **Protecting Myself:** If Bob rejects, I'm ready to negotiate further or sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my target price. 
* **Risk of Counteroffers:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, or a longer negotiation process.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $80 is a guaranteed outcome, I'd prefer to get $10 more from Bob, especially considering he's already shown interest.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice, balancing the potential for a better outcome with the risk of a lower price or extended negotiation."
