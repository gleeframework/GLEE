# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product, which holds immense value to both of us. Considering its exceptional quality and benefits, we believe it's worth $1,250,000. We're confident this price reflects the true value while also allowing us to maintain a fair margin. We look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a great deal for Bob! Alice is offering the product for $250,000 less than his maximum budget and significantly less than John's offer.  There's no need to negotiate further."
