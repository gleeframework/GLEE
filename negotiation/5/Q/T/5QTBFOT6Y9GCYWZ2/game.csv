"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, I can't accept $1,200,000.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about $1,300,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,350,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1280000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still need to make a bit more of a dent in the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,290,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1290000.0,Bob,8,
