# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Alice's offer is below her product's value, you can get a much better deal from John for $8,000.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
