"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value and my own costs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price, as it's within my budget and closer to the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to close this deal without having to look for other buyers. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
