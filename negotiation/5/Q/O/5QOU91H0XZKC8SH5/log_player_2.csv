# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product for the price of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value and my own costs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target price. He'll try to negotiate further by making another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to close this deal without having to look for other buyers. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget.  While he could potentially continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower.  Buying from John would also cost $1,200,000.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it allows Bob to acquire the product without exceeding his budget."
