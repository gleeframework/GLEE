Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,200,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 

By offering the product at $1,400,000, you aim to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still ensuring Bob sees a benefit in purchasing from you rather than losing the opportunity.  

**Important Considerations:**

* This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation skills or potential to counter-offer.
* There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer, in which case you'd still have the guaranteed sale to John."
