Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to propose a counter-offer."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that the price is justified. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  By expressing a willingness to discuss and consider counter-offers, you encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** While you have John as a backup, it's not beneficial to reveal this to Bob.  Knowing about John weakens your negotiating position. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:** This strategy assumes limited market information. If you knew more about the demand for your product or Bob's financial situation, you could tailor your offer more precisely.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, you might adopt a less aggressive opening offer."
