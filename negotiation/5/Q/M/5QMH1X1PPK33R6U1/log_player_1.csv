Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. It's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly. 
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit,  a price too far above Bob's perceived value ($120) might make him immediately lose interest. $150 allows for some back-and-forth.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on the product's value and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
 
This strategy aims to give Alice the best chance of securing a price higher than her minimum while still being attractive enough to avoid Bob rejecting the offer outright."
