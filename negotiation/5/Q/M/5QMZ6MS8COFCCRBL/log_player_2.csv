Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $115. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still keeping the price within my comfort zone. Alice has shown a willingness to lower her price, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to secure a deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $100. While it's getting closer, I'm willing to keep negotiating for a few more rounds to see if I can get an even better price.  I'm also getting a little nervous about running out of time, which is why I'm not jumping at this offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 118}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a small increase to my offer, going up to $118. I'm hoping this small increase will be enough to convince Alice to accept, as we are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  This is a compromise, as I am still below my maximum budget, but I want to avoid having to buy from John as a last resort."
