Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product you might be interested in. I think it's worth at least $150. How about you start the bidding at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Encouraging a Counteroffer:** By suggesting Bob ""starts the bidding,"" Alice encourages him to actively participate in the negotiation rather than just rejecting the initial offer outright.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While aiming high, Alice is mindful that she has a guaranteed buyer at $100. This knowledge gives her the confidence to walk away if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, it's a bit high for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both Alice's asking price and the product's value to both parties.  Alice knows she has a guaranteed $100 from John, making Bob's offer unattractive. By rejecting, Alice signals her willingness to negotiate but not at a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Bob, but $90 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and worth every penny. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm, But Flexible:** Alice is holding firm by not drastically dropping her price. A $10 decrease shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying above John's offer.
* **Justification:**  By briefly mentioning the product's quality, Alice subtly reinforces its value, aiming to justify the higher price.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This common negotiation tactic can feel like a win-win to both parties, potentially making Bob more agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a high-quality product, but I'm still not willing to pay $110. How about we try $100? That's my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met Alice's minimum acceptable price. While Alice might have tried to push for a slightly higher amount, there's no guarantee Bob would go any higher. Accepting this offer secures a sale at her desired price point without risking losing the sale altogether."
