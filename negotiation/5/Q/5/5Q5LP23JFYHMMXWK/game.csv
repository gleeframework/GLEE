"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a little higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to pay $15,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",16000.0,Alice,5,
