Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Starting with enthusiasm and emphasizing ""opportunity"" aims to pique Bob's interest.
* **Value-based language:**  Phrases like ""value,"" ""potential,"" and ""true worth"" emphasize why the price is justified, even though it's above Bob's estimated value.
* **Negotiating room:** By starting at $1,500,000, I leave space for potential negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. If Bob counters, I can still go lower and secure a deal above my minimum.
* **Backup plan:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below that price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If I know Bob is highly price-sensitive, I might adjust my initial offer slightly lower. 
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, I might be willing to accept a smaller profit margin."
