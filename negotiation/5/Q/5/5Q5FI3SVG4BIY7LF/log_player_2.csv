Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  While she might be bluffing, it's risky to continue negotiating. She's unlikely to go much lower, and we have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000. It's better to secure the product at a price we know is good than risk ending up with no deal and potentially having to pay more later."
