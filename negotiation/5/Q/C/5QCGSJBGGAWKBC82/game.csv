"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway between our prices. How about $900000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
