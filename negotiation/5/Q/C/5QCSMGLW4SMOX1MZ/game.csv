"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,200,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it will be extremely valuable to you.  While I'm confident in its value, I understand if this price point doesn't work for you.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at $800,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
