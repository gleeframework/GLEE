"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,200,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it will be extremely valuable to you.  While I'm confident in its value, I understand if this price point doesn't work for you.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at $800,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
