{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I want to give you a competitive price."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below Bob's perceived value ($8,000) might seem tempting, but it risks leaving money on the table. A price of $9,500 aims to:
    * Be attractive to Bob as it's still a ""deal"" for him.
    * Secure a significant profit for me, even if it's slightly less than selling to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer could lead to a counter-offer from Bob, potentially landing us at a price point that works well for both of us."
