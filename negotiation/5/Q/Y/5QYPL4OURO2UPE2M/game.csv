"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $9000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $9500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise further if needed.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'll offer you a revised price of $10800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10800. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $9200. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",9200.0,Bob,6,
