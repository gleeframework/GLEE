"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it, reflecting its value to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I can justify right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This is the closest I can get to your offer without going below my minimum.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're almost there! I really want to make this deal work, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,110,000.  This is my final offer - what do you say?",1110000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already given you a good deal considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,115,000, but I need to be realistic about the minimum I can accept. I'm not going to go any lower than this.",1115000.0,Alice,7,
