"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $800000. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $850000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to pay $950000. This is a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $950000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm prepared to go down to $1050000. This is a significant compromise, and I truly believe we can reach a deal that benefits us both. Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a little higher than my budget at $1050000.  I'm prepared to offer $980000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",980000.0,Bob,6,
