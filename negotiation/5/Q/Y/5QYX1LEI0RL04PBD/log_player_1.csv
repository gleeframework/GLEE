"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a great value for you, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Price:** I've set a high starting price of $1,200,000, knowing it's more than Bob's perceived value. This is a common negotiation tactic to establish a strong starting point and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm clear that I'm open to negotiation, acknowledging that we may need to find a price that works for both of us. 
* **Time Constraint:** The knowledge of the 10-round limit and the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 creates a sense of urgency for Bob.

**Strategy:**

By setting a high price and using positive language, I aim to create a sense of value and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to my desired value. I also want to make sure Bob understands that while I'm open to negotiation, I'm not desperate and have another buyer waiting in the wings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $800000. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired value and even lower than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed alternative.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  Show Bob that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if I don't get a better price.
* **Continue Negotiation:**  I can use this opportunity to send a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our desired prices. 
* **Time Constraint:**  The knowledge that I only have 10 rounds pushes Bob to consider making a more reasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:**  I've reiterated the value of the product and highlighted the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm reminding Bob that time is limited, encouraging him to consider my offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price above the $1,000,000 I can secure from John. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By still being above John's offer, I'm keeping the option to sell to him open, which keeps pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to pay $950000. This is a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my desired value and just $50,000 more than what I can get from John. While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, I'm not yet ready to settle for such a low price.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate that I'm not under pressure and have a better alternative.
* **Room for Improvement:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue pushing for a higher price, potentially closer to my desired value.
* **Time Constraint:** The remaining rounds provide an opportunity to reach a more favorable agreement or walk away and sell to John if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $950,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm prepared to go down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and I truly believe we can reach a deal that benefits us both. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping the price higher than John's offer. 
* **Sense of Compromise:** I emphasize that this offer is a significant compromise, highlighting my willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I focus on finding a mutually beneficial deal, encouraging Bob to see the value in continuing the negotiation.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a little higher than my budget at $1050000.  I'm prepared to offer $980000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $980,000 is getting closer to my desired value, it's still slightly less than what I can get from John. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's lower than my guaranteed alternative.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I want to maximize my profit.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates my resolve to get a better price.
* **Continue Negotiating:** I can use the remaining rounds to try and reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Time Pressure:** I can leverage the limited rounds to push Bob to consider a more favorable offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I continue to show him that I have a strong alternative and am not desperate to close the deal. This will hopefully encourage him to make a more competitive offer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000. This offer acknowledges your financial constraints while still reflecting the true value of this product. With only a few rounds left, let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1020000}

* **Final Push:**  With limited time remaining, I aim to create a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still not willing to go below John's offer, keeping the option to sell to him open and creating a sense of pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1020000 is still a bit too high for me. While we're getting closer, my budget is fixed at $980000.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still lower than what I can get from John.  With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high.  I'm confident that I can secure a better price from John, and I don't want to jeopardize a guaranteed sale.

**Strategy:**

* **Guarantee the Deal:**  Selling to John ensures that I will receive a price that's at least $1,000,000, eliminating any risk of a lower offer.
* **Time Constraint:**  With limited rounds left, the risk of not finding common ground with Bob is increasing.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, selling to John prevents a potential loss from further negotiation with Bob. 

By choosing to sell to John, I'm prioritizing a guaranteed profit over the potential for a higher price from Bob.  This decision balances the desire for the best price with the need to secure a deal within the time constraints of the negotiation."
