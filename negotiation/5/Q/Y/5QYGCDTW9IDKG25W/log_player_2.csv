"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but Bob can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need to start at a lower price point to make this work for me. I'm going to offer $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can get an even lower price. There are still several rounds left, and rejecting allows Bob to continue the bargaining process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. This is a fair price considering our positions and would allow us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1030000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal. Although Alice is coming down in price,  $1,030,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's last counteroffer. There are still rounds left, so Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. How about $1,027,500? This represents a reasonable compromise between our last offers. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1027500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1028000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,028,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,028,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob.  Alice's counteroffer is close to Bob's last offer, and Alice has indicated that this is her final concession.  If Bob rejects this offer, it's likely the price will not go down further.  Alice may be more likely to sell to another buyer, or Bob could end up buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer is the most sensible option at this stage."
