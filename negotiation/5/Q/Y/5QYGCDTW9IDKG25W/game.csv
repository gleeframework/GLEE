"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need to start at a lower price point to make this work for me. I'm going to offer $1000000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1025000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. This is a fair price considering our positions and would allow us to come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1030000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. How about $1027500? This represents a reasonable compromise between our last offers. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",1027500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1028000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1028000.0,Alice,7,
