"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $115? "", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $115.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, accepting at $125 is a good compromise.  It's still a better price than John's $150, and further negotiation might not be worth the time and effort."
