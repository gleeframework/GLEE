"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do like the product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer, but $9,500 is still a little too high for me. Could you do $8,500? ",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to give you a small concession, though. How about we meet at $9,200?",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to keep negotiating.  $9,200 is still a bit out of my price range.  I could go up to $8,250. That's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Bob,6,
