"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to the value I've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering both our needs, and I'm confident we can close the deal. ",1550000.0,Bob,4,
