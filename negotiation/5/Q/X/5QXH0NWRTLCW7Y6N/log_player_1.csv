Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures you don't sell below your minimum.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's initial offer but is lower than my previous offer. This shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate, but I am still not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I am tempted to accept Bob's offer since it's close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and make one last counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,900? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8900} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise that meets Bob halfway. It's a good final offer as it:

* **Is close to Bob's last offer:**  Shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Is still above my minimum acceptable price:**  Ensures I don't sell below my threshold.
* **Emphasizes finality:**  Indicates it's my last offer, pushing Bob to make a decision."
