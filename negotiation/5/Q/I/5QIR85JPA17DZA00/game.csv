"Alice, your product looks great!  However, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $12000. Would you be willing to consider that price? ",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $13500. Would that work for you?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to come down to $13000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,5,
