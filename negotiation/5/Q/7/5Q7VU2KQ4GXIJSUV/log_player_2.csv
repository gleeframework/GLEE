I'm going to start by making a significant counteroffer.  $1 million is still a good deal for Alice, and it gives us a strong starting point for negotiation."

Alice has come down a bit, and we're getting close to my desired price point. Accepting this offer is a good compromise, as it's still a decent saving and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's also less risky than continuing to negotiate and potentially losing out to John."
