Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $11,500. I know this is a significant purchase, but I truly believe it's worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000,  getting Bob to buy it at a slightly lower price still yields a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,500 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while staying well above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly highlights the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it seriously. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit from Bob with the security of John's guaranteed purchase."
