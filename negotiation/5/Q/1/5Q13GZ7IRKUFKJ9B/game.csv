"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. While I can't disclose specifics at this time, I assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000.  This is a price point that reflects its potential value while still being fair for both of us. Consider this an exclusive opportunity. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can discuss further details.  If not, I will be selling it to another buyer for $1000000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
