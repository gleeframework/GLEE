"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  Since you have 10 rounds, there's room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming to secure a significant discount. This strategy aims to quickly establish a lower price point and put pressure on Alice to negotiate.  The goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of us within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of reaching a deal with Alice is diminishing. There's also the risk that Alice might walk away, leaving me with only the option to buy from John at $150. Accepting the offer at $110 secures a purchase below my maximum price and avoids potential further negotiations."
