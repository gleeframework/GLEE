"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. Given its value, I think a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $15,000 from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $17,000? That would be a more reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about $13,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counter offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,000 is still too low. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has met your bottom line. There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further, as you can't get a better price from John."
