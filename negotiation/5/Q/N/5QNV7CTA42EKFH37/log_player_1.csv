Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $10,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you're subtly reminding Bob of its worth, making the higher price seem more reasonable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" and asking for Bob's thoughts signals that you're willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still acknowledging Bob's interest and leaving space for a deal that works for both parties."
