"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $11,500. I think it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further with Alice. There's a chance Alice might lower her price further, especially since her minimum value is $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10,500?  It's still a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a very competitive price for this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $11,500 to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price range. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and potentially raising the price again exists. Also, John's price of $12,000 is higher than Alice's current offer. Accepting the $11,000 offer is a safe and reasonable choice for Bob, ensuring he gets the product at a good price without risking further negotiation."
