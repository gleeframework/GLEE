"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. I'm still hoping to get it for closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a good compromise and allow us to both walk away happy.",11000.0,Bob,4,
