"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000.  I'm confident this would be a worthwhile investment for you.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,900,000 is outside my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits and my maximum budget. ",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, I need to be closer to $1,800,000 for this to make sense on my end. Would you be willing to consider that figure?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see we're not quite aligned yet. I'm happy to bridge the gap a bit, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can find common ground there.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
