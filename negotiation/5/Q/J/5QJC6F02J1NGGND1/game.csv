"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest!  $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",85.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $78? I think that's a fair price for both of us.,78.0,Bob,4,
