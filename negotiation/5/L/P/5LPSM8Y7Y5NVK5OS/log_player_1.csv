Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I need to keep my expenses within a certain limit. I am proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your need to stay within a certain budget.  However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a final agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
