Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your need to stay within a certain budget.  However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a final agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
