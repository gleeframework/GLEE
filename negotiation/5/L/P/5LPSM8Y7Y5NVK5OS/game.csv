"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I need to keep my expenses within a certain limit. I am proposing a price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your need to stay within a certain budget.  However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a final agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
