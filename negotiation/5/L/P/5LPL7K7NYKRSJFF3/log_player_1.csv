I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This gives him a potential benefit of $5,000 if he values the product higher than my minimum price of $15,000.  If he rejects, I'll still get my minimum from John. This strategy balances maximizing my profit with the possibility of getting a better deal from Bob."
