"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $19,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would that be possible?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $15,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Could you consider $11,500?  I feel that's a fair offer.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is close, but I need to get a bit more.  Would you be willing to do $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more, how about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
