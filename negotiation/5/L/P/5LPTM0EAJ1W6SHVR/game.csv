"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking to my offer of $80. It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to work with me.",80.0,Bob,4,
