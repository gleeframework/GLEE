The offer is good but there's definitely room for negotiation, especially with the ""one-time offer"" phrasing. It's worth trying to get a better deal."

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.

Alice is still asking for a price above what I'm willing to pay. It's worth seeing if we can get closer to my target price."

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is closer to my target price of $750,000.  While I'd prefer to get it lower,  it's a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,200,000.  It's time to accept the offer and move forward with the purchase."
