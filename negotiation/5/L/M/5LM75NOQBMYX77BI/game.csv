"Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be a great asset to your operations. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm sure you'll find it a very attractive proposition. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
