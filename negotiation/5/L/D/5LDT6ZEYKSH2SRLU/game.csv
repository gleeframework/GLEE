"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is quite high though.  I'm thinking more in the range of $600,000 for the product.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your perspective on the value. I appreciate your direct approach.  While $600,000 is too low,  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth and potential of the product.  What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than what I have in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I'm flexible, I need to be realistic about the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This offer reflects my desire to close this deal and represents a significant discount from my original ask.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're making progress but we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, I'm only willing to go as high as $900,000 for this product.  If that doesn't work, I may have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your limit.  I've tried to be flexible, but I also have to be firm on what I can accept.  My final offer is $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a very fair price considering the product's true value.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other opportunities, even though I'd prefer to do business with you.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
