You should reject Alice's offer. It's way over your budget. You can try to negotiate a better price with Alice."

{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a low offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's asking price, but it's still a good starting point for negotiation. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a good faith attempt to find a middle ground."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,800,000 is still too high.  I'll counteroffer again and try to get closer to my target price."

I'm raising my offer to $1,250,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but still staying within my budget. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, $1,700,000 is still too high. I'll make one more counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $1,400,000. This is a good compromise, as it's only $100,000 more than my ideal price and significantly lower than Alice's current offer. If Alice rejects this, I'll be ready to go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above my desired price.  I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like she's not willing to go lower. It's time to move on and buy the product from John. Although I'm not getting the absolute lowest price, it's still a reasonable deal and it's time to finalize the purchase."
