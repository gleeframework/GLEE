"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $100. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Since Bob is willing to pay up to $120, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking for a better price. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I think it's a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is a fair compromise.  It's still below Bob's maximum price of $120, and closer to his desired price of $90. Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
