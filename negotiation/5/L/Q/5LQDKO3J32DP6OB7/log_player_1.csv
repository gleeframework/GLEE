Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room for compromise. It's also above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000, so I'm not losing any money. 

I'll be watching Bob's response closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $950,000 isn't ideal, it's closer to my minimum threshold of $1,000,000 and a better deal than selling to John for $1,000,000.  It's also a sign that Bob might be willing to negotiate further in the future, should I need to sell a similar product."
