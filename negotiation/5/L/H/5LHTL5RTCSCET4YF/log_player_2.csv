"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is reflective of the significant return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is far too high, and I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000. I'll start by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I value the product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $800,000.  This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000. I'll go with John's offer."
