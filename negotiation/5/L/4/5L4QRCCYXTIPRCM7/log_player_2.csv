"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to secure a better price."
