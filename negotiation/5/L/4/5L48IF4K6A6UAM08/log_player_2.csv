# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Bob should reject the offer. He is willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is too high.  There's room for negotiation to save money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. However, I have to balance that with the value I need to get out of this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11000 for the product. Would you be willing to go to $11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target, he can still save money by counter-offering. It's worth trying to negotiate further before settling."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11250, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a good deal for you, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He is willing to pay up to $12,000 and Alice is offering the product for $11,250.  While he might be able to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer or him having to pay John's higher price is too high. Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option in this situation."
