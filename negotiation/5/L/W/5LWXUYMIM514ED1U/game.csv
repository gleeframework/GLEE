"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,500,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $1,200,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could do $800,000 - it's a fair offer that recognizes the product's worth.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $800,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll meet you at $1,100,000. This is my final offer in this range, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm also eager to get this deal done. How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'll need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is my last offer above $1,000,000, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
