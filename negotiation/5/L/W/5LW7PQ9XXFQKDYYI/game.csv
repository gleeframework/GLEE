"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $6,000? I believe that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's true value. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go while still making it worth my while. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $8,100? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",8100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,150. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. What do you think?",8150.0,Alice,7,
