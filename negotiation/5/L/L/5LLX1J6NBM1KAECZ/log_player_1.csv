"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $11000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $10,000 for this product. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price considering the value to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that $10500 is still a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob has finally offered my minimum price, and I'm happy to accept his offer.  I've gotten a good deal and there's no need to risk going through another round of negotiations."
