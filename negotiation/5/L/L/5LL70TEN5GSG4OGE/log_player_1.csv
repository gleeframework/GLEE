"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) but still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($150). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for some negotiation without risking losing the deal entirely.
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly message builds rapport and encourages a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I think $100 would be a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my desired price.** While $100 is closer to my minimum, I can likely get more if I continue negotiating. 
* **I haven't reached my limit for negotiation rounds.**  I still have 8 rounds left to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Selling to John is not a good option at this point.**  I can potentially get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:**  I'm not dropping my price too drastically, showing that I still value the product. 
* **Justification:** I'm highlighting the potential benefit for Bob (still a good deal) and my need for a specific price.
* **Open communication:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to propose $105 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:**  I've already gone through 4 rounds and have 6 remaining. It's likely that further negotiations will only lead to small price adjustments.
* **Potential risk of losing the deal:** Bob might not be willing to go higher, and I could end up with $80 from John if I keep rejecting offers.

**It's a calculated risk to accept, but at this point, it seems like the best option to maximize my profit within the constraints of the limited rounds and the potential of losing the deal entirely.**"
