"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within his budget, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of $100. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a good strategy to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. He's offered a price that's closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving some room for further negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  A counteroffer of $105 allows for potential compromise on both sides. 
* **Setting a precedent:**  A lower initial counteroffer can make Alice more likely to agree to a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm aiming for a slightly higher price, I'm willing to come down to $110. I think that's a fair deal considering the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $110 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for further negotiation.  Alice has shown willingness to compromise, indicating a potential for a better deal.
* **Avoiding a rush decision:** Accepting the offer at this point might leave Bob feeling like he could have gotten a better price. Continuing the negotiation gives him the chance to potentially secure a lower price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting the offer, Bob maintains his negotiating leverage and can potentially get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a slightly better price. How about $108?  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Compromise:** Bob is offering a small compromise, increasing his offer by a few dollars, showing a genuine interest in reaching an agreement.
* **Towards a Fair Deal:** The offer of $108 is still within Alice's desired range but closer to Bob's target. 
* **Positioning for Acceptance:**  The message emphasizes a fair compromise and positions the offer as a potential win for both parties."
