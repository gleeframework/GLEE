"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to me, subtly reminding Bob that he's getting a great deal compared to its true worth. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. By starting high and showing flexibility, I hope to encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing me to adjust the price strategically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my ideal price, $9,500 is still below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate.  This suggests there's room for me to push for a higher price in the next round.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed profit:** I could sell to John now and guarantee a profit, but I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round. My goal is to get closer to $12,000, but I'll always have John as a backup option if negotiations break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $9,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" which could appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Focus on the deal:** I'm re-emphasizing the potential of reaching a deal, encouraging Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to inch closer to my desired price without alienating Bob. By offering a compromise, I'm aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still interested in purchasing the product, but I am unable to meet the price of $10250. Could we agree on $9750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob is clearly motivated to buy and is continuing to negotiate, indicating potential for a higher offer. 
* **Selling to John is secure:** While I'm getting closer to a decent price, selling to John guarantees my target profit, and I'm not yet convinced I can reach a more favorable deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price closer to my desired $12,000, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup if negotiations fail to reach a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your persistence. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** I'm offering the midpoint between my previous offer ($10,250) and Bob's latest offer ($9,750). This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not willing to go below $10,000.
* **Reiterate Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the price as ""fair"" to maintain the sense of equity and encourage Bob to agree. 
* **Direct Call to Action:** I'm ending with a clear call to action to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

I'm sticking with my strategy of inching towards my desired price while remaining flexible and keeping Bob engaged. I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between my own interests and the possibility of reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I am willing to pay $9800 for the product. This is the highest amount I can afford without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Bob's budget constraint:** Bob mentions his budget constraint, which suggests he might not be willing to go much higher. This could indicate that further negotiation might not lead to a significant increase in price.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees my desired profit. 

**Strategy:**

While it's tempting to close the deal with Bob at this point, I'm going to reject his offer. With only four rounds remaining, I don't want to risk missing out on a better deal with John. I'll make one last counteroffer in the next round to try and push Bob closer to my desired price, but if that fails, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering my previous counteroffer of $10,000, acknowledging Bob's budget limitations while remaining firm on my minimum price. This is a final attempt to bridge the gap.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm reiterating the fairness of the price and the benefits for both of us, hoping to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Call to Action:** I'm urging Bob to make a decision, making it clear that this is the final offer.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds remaining, I'm taking a calculated risk by offering a price I've already offered before. I'm hoping that Bob will realize this is a fair compromise and accept the deal. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob rejects this final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I am willing to pay $9900 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but still below:** Bob's offer of $9,900 is closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Two rounds left:** With only two rounds remaining, there's not enough time to negotiate a significantly higher price with Bob.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John guarantees my desired profit of $12,000, securing my financial goals.

**Strategy:**

While I appreciate Bob's continued efforts, I'm choosing to sell to John.  I believe the time constraint and the relatively small price difference make selling to John the most sensible choice. It ensures I meet my financial goals and minimizes the risk of a potential negotiation breakdown in the final round."
