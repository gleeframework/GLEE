{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. This will give Bob an incentive to accept, but also allow for a potential counteroffer if he wants to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is higher than John's offer of $8,000, it is still below my desired price point.  I want to try to get closer to my desired $10,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $9,500? This would still be a good deal for you since it's well below the $12,000 you value it at."", ""product_price"": 9500}
