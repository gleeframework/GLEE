"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,100,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal before I have to resort to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This represents a substantial compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,150,000 for the product. I hope this proposal helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. While $1,150,000 is better than $1,100,000, I believe I can get a better deal with a counteroffer. I'm also mindful of the fact that John is a backup option, and I'll only sell to him if I have to."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement in this negotiation. While I respect your position, $1,150,000 doesn't quite meet my requirements.  To find common ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the substantial value this product will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd still prefer to get closer to my original asking price, we're now at a point where further negotiation is likely to be unproductive. It's getting close to the point where I might have to sell to John, and I'd rather get $1,200,000 from Bob."
