Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product, and I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $11,500 to make it worth my while.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a decent profit. I'm willing to go down to $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice is only willing to go down to $11,250. This is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since there's a risk of the negotiation going on for longer and potentially getting worse offers, Bob decides to go with the guaranteed price from John."
