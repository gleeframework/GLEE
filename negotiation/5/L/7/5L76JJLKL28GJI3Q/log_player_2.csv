"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm hoping we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not comfortable going below $680,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $680,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $680,000.

Alice is getting closer to our desired price range. We're now less than $100,000 away from a great deal. Let's push a little further."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad to hear that we're close, Bob. However, I'm not ready to give up on the extra $20,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $665,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find a way to make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $665,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $665,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a great price and very close to your previous offer.  It's unlikely you'll get a much better deal from Alice, and continuing to negotiate has the risk of her increasing the price. Accepting this offer secures a significant saving compared to John's offer."
