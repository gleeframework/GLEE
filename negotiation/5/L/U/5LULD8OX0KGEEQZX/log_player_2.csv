"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This is a price that allows for a substantial profit for you while giving me a fair return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000.  Even though the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, accepting Alice's offer saves $100,000."
