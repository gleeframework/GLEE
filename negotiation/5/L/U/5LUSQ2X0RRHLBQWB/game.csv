"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as I can. Can you meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $750,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's compromise.  I'm proposing $850,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000. How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
