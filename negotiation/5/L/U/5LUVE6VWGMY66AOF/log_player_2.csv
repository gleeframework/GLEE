"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it would be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no need to pay $90. By rejecting the offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice or get it for your preferred price from John."
