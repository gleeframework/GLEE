"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer to $13,000, which is still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer from Bob is getting closer to my minimum. While I'd ideally like to get a little more,  I'm concerned about the limited rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids risking a lower offer in the next round or having to settle for John's $12,000."
