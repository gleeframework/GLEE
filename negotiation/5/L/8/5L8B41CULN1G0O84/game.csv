"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000. I believe this is a fair value for both of us, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to reach a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's worth to me, I'm not comfortable going as low as $850,000. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
