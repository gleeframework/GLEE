Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $1,700,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** Starting with a price higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response will reveal how much he values the product and how motivated he is to buy.
* **Backup Plan:** The offer to John provides a safety net, ensuring you don't settle for less than $1,500,000.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. He might try to bring the price down, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go."
