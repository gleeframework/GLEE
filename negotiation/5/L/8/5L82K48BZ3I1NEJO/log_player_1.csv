Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a good middle ground between my minimum acceptable price of $80 and the value Bob places on the product ($120). I believe this gives Bob a fair deal while also allowing me to earn a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 and closer to my initial offer of $100. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a reasonable profit."
