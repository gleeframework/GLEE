Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
