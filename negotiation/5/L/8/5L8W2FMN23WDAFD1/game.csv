"Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which has been meticulously designed to exceed your expectations. This exceptional item is worth more than $1000000 to us, and we believe it could be invaluable to you. To start our negotiation, I propose a price of $2000000 for the product.

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your input and understand your perspective. However, given the unique value and quality of our product, I cannot agree to the proposed price of $1500000. Our current valuation remains at $2000000. I am willing to negotiate and consider a price closer to $1750000. This still reflects a significant discount from our original asking price while acknowledging the value you see in the product. Let me know if this revised offer meets your expectations.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your valuation of our product. After careful consideration, I am willing to lower our asking price to $1650000. This is a substantial discount from our initial offer and reflects the value you've identified in the product. I hope this revised price aligns better with your budget and allows us to reach an agreement. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1650000. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. Can you consider one last concession and meet me at $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,6,
