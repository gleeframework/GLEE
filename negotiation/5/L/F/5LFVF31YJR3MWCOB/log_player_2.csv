"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something I value at least $80, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is more than Alice values the product for, it's a significant savings compared to John's $150 price. Accepting this offer meets your goal of getting the product while saving money."
