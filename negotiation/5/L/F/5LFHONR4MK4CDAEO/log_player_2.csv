"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for me. Could you do $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively low offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This price gives me a good amount of savings but is also still profitable for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $110 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $127? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  While $127 is better than her initial offer, let's see if we can get a bit closer to $110 before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $118?"",
 ""product_price"": 118
}
```

This counter-offer shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, and $118 is a fair price that leaves both of us with some savings/profit."
