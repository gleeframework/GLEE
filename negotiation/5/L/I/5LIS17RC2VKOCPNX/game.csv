"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than $70. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $90? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. How about we try $110? That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to go a little higher, but $110 is still a bit much. How about $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is a good offer, but I'm still not getting as much as I want. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $110. How about we try $102.50? That's the best I can do.",102.5,Alice,7,
