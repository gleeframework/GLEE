Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $95 is a good offer, but I'm still not getting as much as I want. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $110. How about we try $102.50? That's the best I can do.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $100, and we have a guaranteed option with John.  We've done well to negotiate down, but it's not worth the risk of continuing with Alice."
