I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm countering with $925,000.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I would prefer a higher price,  I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. It's better to secure $875,000 than potentially end up with nothing."
