"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the condition of the product, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $135 for it.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $135 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. It's still a great deal for a product in this condition, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know if you're interested.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $145?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to where I need to be.",145.0,Bob,4,
