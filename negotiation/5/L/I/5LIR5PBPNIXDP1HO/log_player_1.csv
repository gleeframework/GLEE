Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. Given my maximum budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's make this work - I can come down to $906,250. This is a significant reduction on my end, reflecting my desire to find an agreement with you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $906,250 is still outside my budget. I'm going to counter with $890,000.  This represents a significant move on my part and shows a strong commitment to this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving upwards, indicating willingness to pay. We're still in early/mid rounds and have room to negotiate.  Holding firm and countering keeps the pressure on Bob while leaving the option to accept later if needed."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $898,125.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.  I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 898125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're moving towards the later rounds and need to signal a willingness to close a deal soon. This offer keeps the price above $890,000 but shows Bob we are flexible and want to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm going to counter with $895,000. This is a serious offer and shows that we're both very close to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're down to the final rounds. Bob is clearly getting close to his maximum, and the difference between his offer and the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John is getting small.  It's better to take a slightly lower offer now than risk Bob walking away in the last round or two."
