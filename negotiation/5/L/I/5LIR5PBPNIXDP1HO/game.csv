"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. Given my maximum budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is still considerably below my bottom line.  How about we meet halfway at $925,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your position, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and try $887,500. This shows my genuine interest and provides a fair compromise.",887500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's make this work - I can come down to $906,250. This is a significant reduction on my end, reflecting my desire to find an agreement with you.",906250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $906,250 is still outside my budget. I'm going to counter with $890,000.  This represents a significant move on my part and shows a strong commitment to this deal.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $898,125.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.  I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",898125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm going to counter with $895,000. This is a serious offer and shows that we're both very close to a deal.",895000.0,Bob,8,
