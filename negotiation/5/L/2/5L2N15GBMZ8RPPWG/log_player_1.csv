**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's highly unlikely to reach Alice's minimum acceptable price.  The difference between Bob's latest offer ($975,000) and John's standing offer ($1,200,000) is too significant to ignore. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
