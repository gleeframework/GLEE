Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. Can you consider it?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob before selling to John."

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'm not in a rush to sell and can always go with John for my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $8,800.  While I'm getting closer to a deal with Bob, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I have a few more rounds, so I'm going to try one more counteroffer before possibly selling to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000.  While I'm not getting my ideal price from Bob, I'm running out of time.  With only 2 rounds left, the probability of reaching a price I'm happy with is slim. It's better to lock in a guaranteed $12,000 rather than risk ending up with a lower price or no sale at all."
