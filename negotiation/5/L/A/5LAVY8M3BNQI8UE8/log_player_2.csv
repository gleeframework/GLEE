"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1200000 for the product. I'm confident that you'll find it to be a fair price, considering its worth to you is $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000 vs. $1,500,000).  I want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,350,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant step towards meeting Alice's price but still offers a sizable discount.  I'm aiming for a gradual negotiation, hoping to bridge the gap without making Alice feel like I'm low-balling her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to consider a price of $1400000, which is a $50000 reduction from your offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. While she has come down $100,000 from her initial offer, I'm still aiming to save as much as possible. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be on the price. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $1,375,000. This reflects the value we both see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work towards a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a smaller step towards Alice's price, but still provides me with a decent saving compared to her previous offer. I'm trying to establish a pattern of gradual compromise to keep the negotiation moving forward and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
