"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to consider a price of $1400000, which is a $50000 reduction from your offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be on the price. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $1375000. This reflects the value we both see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work towards a final agreement.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
