Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 from John.

**Optimal Strategy**

Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her minimum acceptable price, she can use this leverage with Bob.  Alice should aim for a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation to entice him while still maximizing profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it's something you're interested in, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,195,000."", 
""product_price"": 1195000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $1,195,000 is just below Bob's valuation, making it highly appealing to him.
* **Time-Sensitive Implication (Optional):** Alice could subtly imply a time limit on the offer to create a sense of urgency (e.g., ""This offer is available for a limited time."").

**Important Considerations**

* This strategy assumes Alice is confident in John's guaranteed purchase.
* There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential gain from a higher sale price to Bob makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
