Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $107. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $110 for this product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point.  While another round *might* get the price down a few more dollars, it's unlikely to be a significant difference. Accepting at $110 secures a reasonable deal."
