{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm confident that if Bob really wants the product, he'll be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my initial offer.  I believe this price is still fair, considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting closer to my desired price.  I'm going to accept this offer.  It's better than selling to John for $10,000, and it seems like Bob is not willing to go much higher."
