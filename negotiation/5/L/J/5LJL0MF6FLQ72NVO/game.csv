"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but need a much lower price to make it work. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still above my maximum. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer reflects that. How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the product's worth.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me.  Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and it allows us to move closer to a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's aim for a price that acknowledges the product's value while finding common ground. Would you consider $1,425,000? This shows significant movement from my initial ask and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your position, but $1,425,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This reflects a good compromise on both our sides and puts us within striking distance of a deal.  Let's make it happen.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
