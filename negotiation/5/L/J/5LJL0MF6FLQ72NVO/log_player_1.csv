"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but need a much lower price to make it work. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still above my maximum. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer reflects that. How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me.  Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and it allows us to move closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below both my minimum and John's standing offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to push him closer to the $1,500,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's aim for a price that acknowledges the product's value while finding common ground. Would you consider $1,425,000? This shows significant movement from my initial ask and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your position, but $1,425,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This reflects a good compromise on both our sides and puts us within striking distance of a deal.  Let's make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to reach my minimum of $1,500,000. He's moving slowly, and I have a guaranteed offer from John for my minimum acceptable price. It makes the most financial sense to take John's offer now rather than risk Bob not reaching my price point."
