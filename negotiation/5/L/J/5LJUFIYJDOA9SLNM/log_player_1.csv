"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good deal but leaving room for negotiation. I know Bob values the product highly, so I'm confident he'll at least consider this offer.  I'm also leaving a gap for potential counteroffers and negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is a decent amount, I can still likely get more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but not too much.  I'm still aiming for a good deal, and $11,000 is a good compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $10,500. This is still above my minimum price and closer to my desired target.  I'm hoping this will be a fair offer that Bob will accept."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I still think I can get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground.  There are only a few rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $9,750.  This is a compromise, closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum.  It's a fair price, and I believe Bob will see it as a good deal.  We are running out of rounds, so I need to close this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly above my minimum, it's a better deal than selling to John.  We're running out of rounds, and there's a risk that I won't be able to close a better deal. I'll take this offer and move on."
