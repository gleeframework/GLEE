{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $9,500 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Offering it for $8,000 would guarantee a sale but leave potential profit on the table if Bob was willing to pay more.

By starting high but not unreasonably so, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal that benefits her the most."
