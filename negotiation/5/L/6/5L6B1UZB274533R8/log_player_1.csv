Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000 is a good starting point:** It's above Bob's perceived value but still gives him room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** A friendly and encouraging message sets a good tone for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged. By starting with a slightly higher price and keeping John as a backup option, we can strategically navigate the negotiation."
