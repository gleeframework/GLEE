Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $950,000. It's significantly lower than my minimum threshold. I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a lower price, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a significant discount on the product's true value to you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the same as what I could get from John. There's no reason to keep negotiating, so I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
