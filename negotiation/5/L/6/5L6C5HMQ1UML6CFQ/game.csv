"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a lower price, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a significant discount on the product's true value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
