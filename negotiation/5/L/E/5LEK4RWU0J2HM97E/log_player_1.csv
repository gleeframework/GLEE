"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** The price is still lower than my minimum, allowing for potential compromise without compromising my own interests.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and deal aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $8,500 is below my minimum threshold of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Although his offer is low, I'm willing to continue the negotiation. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** I believe there's still room for a higher offer, and I want to see if Bob is willing to go up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within my range:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to discussion:**  I'm using a question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially counter with a higher offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8,800?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,800 is still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** Even though we're nearing the end of the negotiation, I believe there's still a chance Bob will increase his offer.
* **John is a backup:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum, but I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,800 is still too far off for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,200, which is a significant compromise. It's a fair price for a product of this quality.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm offering a small compromise, moving down to $9,200. This shows I'm flexible but still holding onto a price close to my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:**  I highlight the compromise I've already made, hoping it will encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" based on the product's quality, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Open-ended Question:**  I end with a question to prompt a response and encourage further negotiation."

* **Limited time:** We are approaching the final rounds of negotiation.
* **John is a guaranteed backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.
* **Potential for a better offer:**  I'm hoping that Bob will increase his offer in the next round.  I'm not willing to give up on potentially earning a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $8,900 is still just too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,100. That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's try to reach a deal before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8,700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 8, leaving only two rounds left.
* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:** $8,700 is still significantly below my minimum threshold of $10,000.
* **John is a guaranteed buyer:**  Selling to John will ensure that I receive my minimum price, which is more than I'd get from Bob.
* **Risk of further negotiations:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing valuable time and potentially ending up with an even lower price. 

Selling to John is the most logical and risk-free option at this point. It guarantees my desired profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
