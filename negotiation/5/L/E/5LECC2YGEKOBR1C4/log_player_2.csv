"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000 and Alice is only willing to sell at that price, there's no room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer means you can buy the product from John for the same price.  While it doesn't save you money, it gives you the same outcome with the same cost."
