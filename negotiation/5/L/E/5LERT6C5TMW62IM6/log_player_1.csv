Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice wants to maximize her profit, but she also wants to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and having to sell to John at her minimum price. Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Higher than Bob's Value:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), giving Alice room to negotiate.
* **Lower than John's Offer:** It's still lower than what John is willing to pay ($1,200,000), ensuring Alice makes a profit if Bob accepts.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to accept quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal."
