"I appreciate the offer, Alice.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  This would still be a great deal for you as it's well above your value for the product.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to pay a bit lower, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This would still be a profitable sale for you, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
