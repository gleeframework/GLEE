"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I believe it holds even greater value for you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This price reflects a significant discount and gives you a great head start. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but  $1,050,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and it's a price that should still be very attractive to you.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
