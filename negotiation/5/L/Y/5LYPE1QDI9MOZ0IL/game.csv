"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, given my budget, I'm unable to meet at $110. Would it be possible to consider $105 as a compromise?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - $107.50. It's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",107.5,Alice,5,
