"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  Given what I'm willing to pay, I'd like to offer $9,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair considering the value it holds for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $12,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's worth.",10500.0,Bob,4,
