Round 2

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to pay more than $8,000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to get at least $11,000 for this product.  It's a final offer - what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not able to go beyond $8,000 for this product. Is there any way we could reach an agreement within my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to budge much from his $8,000 offer.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that significantly exceeds $9,000. Taking the guaranteed $12,000 from John is the best business decision at this point."
