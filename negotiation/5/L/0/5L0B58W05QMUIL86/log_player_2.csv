"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it could greatly benefit your business. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to her.  You have room to negotiate and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's worth while also allowing us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the value of our product and your interest, I would like to propose a price of $10,500. This is a step closer to your offer but still maintains a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $10,500 is still too high.  There's still potential to negotiate further, especially since you're aware of Alice's minimum selling price ($8,000).  I'll counter with a lower offer to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Given the product's value and my budget, I'm prepared to offer $9,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement without sacrificing too much."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I've considered your latest offer carefully, and I believe we can find common ground. I would like to suggest a price of $10,000 for the product. This price reflects its value while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has dropped her price a bit, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with another counteroffer.  We're both getting closer to a compromise, and I'm not ready to give up on negotiating a lower price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $9,750. This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
