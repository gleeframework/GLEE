**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While her offer is less than your absolute maximum, it's still significantly more than her own valuation and what you'd pay John.  By rejecting her offer, you open the door for a counter-offer closer to her $1,000,000 valuation."
