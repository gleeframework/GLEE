Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with the market value and would allow me to make a stronger profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product has unique capabilities, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but I'd like to propose a small concession - I'd like to discuss the possibility of a payment plan or some other creative financing option that could make the deal more attractive to me. Can we explore that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

``` 

While we could continue negotiating, Bob seems firm on his $1,225,000 limit.  It's unlikely further haggling will yield significantly more, and it introduces risk. Accepting his offer secures a substantial profit and avoids potentially losing the sale altogether."
