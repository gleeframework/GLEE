"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant benefits it will bring to your business.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with the market value and would allow me to make a stronger profit margin.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,200,000 undervalues the product's unique capabilities and the return on investment you'll see.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's say $1,275,000, and we have a deal.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product has unique capabilities, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I respect your perspective on the market value.  To find a compromise, I'm proposing $1,250,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your desire for a strong profit margin.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but I'd like to propose a small concession - I'd like to discuss the possibility of a payment plan or some other creative financing option that could make the deal more attractive to me. Can we explore that?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
