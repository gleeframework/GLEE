Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $145 for it. It's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $145 tempts Bob with a price that's significantly higher than his perceived value ($100) but still gives me a profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
 
It's a balance between securing a good deal with Bob and ensuring I don't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
