Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm confident that $100 is a fair starting point. 

I'll see how Bob responds, and adjust my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  $90 is still above my minimum of $80, but I believe I can get closer to the value Bob places on the product ($120).
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. This gives me the opportunity to push for a better price.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $80 is a guaranteed option, I believe I can secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than Bob's offer, keeping in mind the value the product holds for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is the lowest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Maintaining Optimism:**  I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Bob to accept. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and maintaining a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  $85 is slightly higher than my minimum of $80, which means I'm making a profit.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  We've been negotiating for a while, and further rounds might not yield a significantly better price.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While there's always the chance Bob might increase his offer, it's also possible he could walk away, leaving me with the lower offer from John.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a reasonable profit while minimizing the risk of losing out on a sale."
