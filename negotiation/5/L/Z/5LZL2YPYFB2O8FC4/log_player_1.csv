Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price given the value it provides. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, leaving some room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to encourage him to accept a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm stating that I'm open to discussion, which can help build trust and encourage Bob to counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I'm aiming to secure the best possible price while remaining open to a deal that benefits both of us. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 (John's offer)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,200,000 is still a significant profit, it's below my initial asking price and leaves less room for further negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is clearly interested, but I believe there's still room to push for a higher price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain my position of strength and show that I'm not desperate to sell.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my original asking price, aiming to bridge the gap while still securing a favorable outcome."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a fair price, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the fact that I'm offering a significant discount from my initial asking price. 
* **Finality:** I'm using language that suggests I'm ready to close the deal, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

By offering a counteroffer that's halfway between my original price and Bob's offer, I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. If he rejects again, I'll need to reassess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a compromise:** Bob has come up to $1,250,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result.
* **Time is a factor:**  The longer we negotiate, the greater the risk that John might change his mind or another buyer might emerge.
* **Securing a good deal:**  While $1,250,000 isn't my ideal price, it's still a substantial profit and a good outcome considering Bob's initial offer.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a deal that is within my acceptable range and ensures a quick sale. While I could potentially push for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal to John or prolonging the negotiation outweighs the potential gains."
