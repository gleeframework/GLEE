"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer! However, $200 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $175. Would you consider that?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. While $175 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $125? ",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $125, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $155? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",155.0,Alice,5,
