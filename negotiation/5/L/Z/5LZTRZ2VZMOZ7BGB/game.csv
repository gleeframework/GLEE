"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work towards a deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $920,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $940,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's try to close this deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $940,000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $915,000. I'm getting closer to my budget, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",915000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $915,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $930,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",930000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $930,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $910,000. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",910000.0,Bob,8,
