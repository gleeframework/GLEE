Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value, aiming to subtly influence Bob's perception. 
* **Alternative:** Having a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000 provides a strong fallback position. If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose anything.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. My ultimate goal is to find a price that works for both of us, but ideally closer to my initial offer!"
