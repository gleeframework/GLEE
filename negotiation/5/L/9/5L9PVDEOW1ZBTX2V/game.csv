"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This price reflects the unique benefits and potential for return on investment this product offers.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market demand and the product's potential.",900000.0,Bob,4,
