"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

The product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and Bob is offering $1,000,000. It's not a good deal for me. I can get $1,200,000 from John, and I can still negotiate with Bob. I will counter Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm not comfortable settling for less than $1,200,000, which I can get from John. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach an agreement closer to my target price."

I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. While Bob's offer is tempting, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'll counter and see if we can find common ground."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

It's getting late in the game, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
