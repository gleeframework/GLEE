"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $15,000, which is my budget. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",16000.0,Bob,4,
