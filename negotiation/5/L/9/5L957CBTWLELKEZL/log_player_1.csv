Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).** This gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's above Bob's perceived value ($800,000).** This makes it appealing to him, while still giving you a good profit. 

Let's see how Bob reacts and go from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? I believe this would be closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to an agreement closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still not able to meet the price of $975,000. Could we perhaps aim for $960,000? I believe this would be a reasonable compromise and still allow me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my desired price, and the negotiation process has been tiring. Accepting his offer will secure a good profit while avoiding further negotiation."
