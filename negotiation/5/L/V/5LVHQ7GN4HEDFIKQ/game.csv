"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. Can you meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but my product truly is worth more than $10000.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

I still think $11000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9500. Can you meet me at this price?,9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9500 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you'll get.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $10500, but I'm willing to make another offer. I'd like to propose $9000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",9000.0,Bob,6,
