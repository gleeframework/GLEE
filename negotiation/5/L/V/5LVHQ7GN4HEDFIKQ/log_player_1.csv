"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Confidence:** My message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, aiming to make him more likely to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not setting a hard limit, leaving room for Bob to counter. 

**Strategy:** 

This initial offer aims to get the negotiation started while maximizing my potential profit. I'm willing to move down if needed, but I'm not giving away the product for less than $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can do better. He values the product at $12,000, so there's room for compromise.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John immediately would be the safe option, but it would leave money on the table.  I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  My goal is to secure a price as close to $11,500 as possible without risking losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but my product truly is worth more than $10,000.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Value Focus:** I'm again highlighting the value of the product for Bob to encourage him to see the worth of my counteroffer.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the desire to reach an agreement, creating a sense of urgency and pushing Bob towards a decision.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This is a reasonable compromise that I believe Bob will be more inclined to accept, given his desire for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I still think $11000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9500. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I need to be flexible, accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John immediately would guarantee a profit, and it's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to get a better price from Bob.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  While Bob has lowered his offer, I still believe there's room for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob again, aiming to meet in the middle.  I need to be careful not to let Bob's low offer push me too far down. I'm still confident that I can secure a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you'll get.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's latest one. It shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a profit.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that this deal is still a good investment for him.
* **Urgency:** I  use phrases like ""close this deal"" and ""move forward"" to subtly create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a calculated risk by going down to $10,500, but it's my last shot at getting closer to my desired price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John to secure a profit and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $10500, but I'm willing to make another offer. I'd like to propose $9000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter:** Bob's offer is even lower than his previous one, and it's now below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited Time:**  We're reaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and I've already made several concessions. There's a high risk of not reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit, and the risk of a further decrease in Bob's offer is too high. 

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed profit. Bob's continued refusal to meet my price suggests a lack of real interest in the product at a price that's fair for me.  While I would have liked to secure a higher price, John offers a reliable and safe alternative."
