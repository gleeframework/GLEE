"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1,000,000?  This would give you a good deal, and it's still within a reasonable range for me.  Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",950000.0,Bob,4,
