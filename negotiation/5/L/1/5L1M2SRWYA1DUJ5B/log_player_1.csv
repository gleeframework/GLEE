{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **""Fair price""**: This phrase implies I'm open to negotiation while also suggesting the price is justified.

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards while still earning above my minimum.
* **Initiate the negotiation:** A clear offer sets the stage for a productive conversation. 
* **Maintain flexibility:** The wording allows for adjustments if Bob counters with a significantly lower price.

Remember, this is just the first step. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response to maximize my earnings while keeping John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $16000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is higher than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. He has clearly shown interest in the product, and I'm confident that I can push for a price closer to my initial offer. 

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, perhaps $17,000. This shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm not willing to drop my price too drastically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking to get closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to consider $17,000? It's a fair compromise that still allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lowering the price:** I've lowered my price from $18,000 to $17,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the $17,000 as a ""fair compromise,"" implying it's a reasonable price for both of us.
* **Reminding Bob of my costs:** Mentioning my costs indirectly reinforces my need to get a price closer to my initial offer.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Keep negotiations moving:** A moderate counteroffer keeps the conversation going without giving away too much.
* **Gauge Bob's willingness to pay:** His reaction to $17,000 will reveal if he's serious about buying the product.
* **Prepare for further negotiation:**  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to reassess my position and consider whether to lower my price again or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $16500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $16,500 is only $500 less than my previous offer of $17,000. This means I'm very close to my desired price range and it's unlikely I'll be able to get significantly more. 

**Here's why I'm accepting:**

* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, potentially forcing me to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Time is a factor:**  The longer I negotiate, the more time I'm spending and the greater the chance of another buyer emerging.
* **Good profit:** $16,500 is still a good profit for me, significantly exceeding my minimum value of $12,000.

**By accepting, I secure a sale that is both profitable and timely.**"
