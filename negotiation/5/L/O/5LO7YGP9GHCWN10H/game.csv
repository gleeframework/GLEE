"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about $108?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $108 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $112.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise for both of us.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $112 is still outside my budget.  Would you be willing to accept $110?  This is a good compromise for both of us, and it's the highest I can go at the moment.",110.0,Bob,6,
