""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special price of $14,000. I think it's a fantastic deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, aiming slightly above that increases our potential profit while still being within a reasonable range for Bob to consider.
* **Alternative Option:** We have a safety net with John, who's willing to buy the product for $15,000. This gives us leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

By offering the product at $14,000, we're aiming for a win-win situation:

* **If Bob accepts:** We make a $14,000 profit, which is $1,000 more than we would make from John.
* **If Bob negotiates:**  We have room to lower the price slightly, potentially settling around $13,000-$13,500, still making a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:**  We confidently sell the product to John for our guaranteed $15,000."
