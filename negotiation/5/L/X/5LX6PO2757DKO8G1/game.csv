"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would really benefit you. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. $200 might have been a little high, but $120 is quite low for the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",140.0,Bob,4,
