"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good price for you considering you value it at $12,000. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still out of my price range. I'm firm at $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a new offer of $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,5,
