"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1200000 is a significant amount, it doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1500000.  This price still allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
