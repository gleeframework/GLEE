Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,750,000.  This reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle this right now at $1,600,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down on her price, her ""final offer"" of $1,600,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and continuing the negotiation risks exceeding your budget or missing out on John's offer. Buying from John guarantees you stay within budget and get the product."
