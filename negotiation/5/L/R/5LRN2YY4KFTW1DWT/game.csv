"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. It's a fair price considering its value and condition. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is my absolute bottom line. Let's make a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $9,750 isn't going to work for me. How about $10,250? It's a fair compromise that's closer to my asking price, and still gives you a good deal. Let's close this deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
