"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. It's a fair price considering its value and condition. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is my absolute bottom line. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750?"", ""product_price"": 9750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $9,750 isn't going to work for me. How about $10,250? It's a fair compromise that's closer to my asking price, and still gives you a good deal. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $10,000. You've successfully negotiated her down, but you have a guaranteed option with John at your target price."
