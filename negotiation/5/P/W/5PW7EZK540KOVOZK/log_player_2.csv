"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are looking to spend no more than $1,200,000.
* Alice's offer is $1,300,000, which is more than your budget.
* Buying from John for $1,200,000 is also an option, but it's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, offering $1,100,000. This is a substantial discount from Alice's initial price, but still within the range I'm willing to pay. 
*  I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate and how far she is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above my target price of $1,200,000.  
* I can still potentially negotiate a better price, but I need to be careful not to go too low and risk losing the deal entirely. 
* I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,150,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am still trying to get a good price. 
*  I believe this is a reasonable offer, considering Alice's previous counteroffer of $1,250,000. 
* I want to see if I can reach a compromise with Alice.  If she rejects this, I'll likely buy from John."
