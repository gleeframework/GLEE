Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully allows me to get a better price. I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can push for a higher price. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm glad you're interested. While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $925,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $940,000? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 940000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $940,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I can only go up to $920,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price. I will counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $920,000 is still a bit too low. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $930,000. This is my final offer - let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 930000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are getting close to my minimum, but I'm running out of time and the risk of not getting a better offer is high.  Given that I can sell to John for $1,200,000, I'm going to take the guaranteed deal and move on."
