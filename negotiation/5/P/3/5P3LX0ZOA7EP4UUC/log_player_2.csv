"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can always go to John if you can't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $115 is a tempting offer, I'm aiming for something a little closer to my initial price. Would you consider $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$125 is a good price, and it's still within your budget. It's better than going to John and paying $150."
