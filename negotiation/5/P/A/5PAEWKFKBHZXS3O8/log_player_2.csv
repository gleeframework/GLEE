"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I believe a price of $925,000 reflects that value while still being a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is too high. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to get her to lower the price closer to her value of $800,000."
