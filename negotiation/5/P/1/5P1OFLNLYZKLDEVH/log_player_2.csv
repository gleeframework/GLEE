"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a truly unique item with significant value. I'm confident this price is fair considering its potential benefits for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the same product for $800,000 from John.  It's worth exploring if he can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer, but $850,000 is significantly lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He should continue negotiating with Alice.  He can likely secure a better price by continuing to make counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting close to Bob's budget, it's still more than what he's willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation. He should continue to counteroffer with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit higher than where I can go.  I'm willing to pay $925,000. This is a fair price given the value to me and is within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer! I understand your budget, but $925,000 still doesn't quite cover the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While $940,000 is a better price than previous rounds, it's still above his ideal budget. He can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. Also, he always has the option of buying from John if the negotiation falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can go up to $930,000. This is my final offer, as it's within my budget and reflects the value I place on this product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 930000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $930,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $935,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident this price is fair given the value of the product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $935,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, as $935,000 is close to Bob's ideal budget. However, there's only one round left.  There's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and Bob risks getting stuck with a price higher than what he'd pay John.  It's safer to buy from John and secure the product at his lower price."
