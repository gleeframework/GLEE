,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I really appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $110? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125?  That's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $125 is still a little higher than I'd like to pay. How about $120? That's the absolute most I can go for this. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,4,
