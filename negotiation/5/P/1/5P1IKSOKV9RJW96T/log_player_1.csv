"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and persuasive. This allows for potential counteroffers and gives me a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I need to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I think I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
``` 
 
I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm also showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer.  I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob to encourage him to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had budgeted. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer to my bottom line. I've already rejected him once at $13,000, and continuing to reject him might result in him walking away. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and gets me closer to my minimum. I can always try to negotiate with him further in the future if the opportunity arises."
