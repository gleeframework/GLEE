"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position that gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $1,600,000.  This shows flexibility while still maintaining a strong negotiating position. I believe Bob is getting closer to my desired price range, and I'm hoping he'll accept this offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,450,000 is getting close, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can reach my target."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}

This is my final counteroffer. I'm dropping the price to $1,550,000, which is just above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While I was hoping to get a higher price from Bob, we've reached a point where it's unlikely I can secure a better deal with him. John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation and potential losses."
