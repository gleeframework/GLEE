Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer shows interest, it's not close to what the product is worth to me. I have room to counteroffer and potentially reach a more agreeable price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you.  This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Within Range:** $10,500 is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a decent profit margin.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing that this is a ""one-time offer"" to create a sense of urgency and potentially push Bob towards accepting.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product by emphasizing that it's a ""great deal"" for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer, but Not Enough:** Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price.
* **Time is Money:**  I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and further haggling could take time that I could use to find other buyers or pursue other opportunities.
* **Guarantee with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $15,000, which is a much safer and more lucrative option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

While there's a chance I could get a slightly better price with more negotiation, the risk of Bob not accepting my next offer or the negotiation dragging on is not worth the potential $200 difference. Selling to John ensures a quicker and more certain outcome."
