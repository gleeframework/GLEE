"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention.  However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While the product is extremely valuable, I'm willing to adjust my price to  $1,050,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
