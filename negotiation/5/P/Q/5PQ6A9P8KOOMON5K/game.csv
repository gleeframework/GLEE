"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the significant value this product holds, while still offering you a substantial savings compared to its full potential.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
