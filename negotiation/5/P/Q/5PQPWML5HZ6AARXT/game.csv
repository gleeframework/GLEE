"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $1,025,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
