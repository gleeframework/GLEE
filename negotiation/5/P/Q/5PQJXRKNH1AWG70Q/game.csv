"Bob,  I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our continued discussion, $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to reach a deal in this round!",1150000.0,Alice,3,
