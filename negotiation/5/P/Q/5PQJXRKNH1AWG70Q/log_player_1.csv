"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  This is a great price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is a significant amount for Bob but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great price"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Room for compromise:**  This leaves room for me to lower the price in subsequent rounds if necessary. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **I have leverage:** Knowing John is willing to pay more gives me the confidence to push for a better deal.
* **More rounds available:**  I still have 8 rounds to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our continued discussion, $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to reach a deal in this round!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from the previous round.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  I remind Bob that $1,150,000 is still a good deal for him, given the product's worth to him.
* **Urgency:** I add a sense of urgency by suggesting the need to reach a deal in this round. This puts a bit of pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Still above my minimum:** $1,150,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, so I'm in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** With John ready to buy at $1,500,000, I have no reason to settle for less, especially with several rounds remaining.
* **Room for negotiation:** I can continue to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,075,000 is still not in the range I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and lets get this deal done.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm showing I'm serious about my minimum price but still willing to compromise.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm highlighting that the offer is ""fair"" for both of us, making it less likely Bob will feel pressured or taken advantage of.
* **Urgency:** Again, I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept.
* **John as a backup:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price from John if necessary."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a specific price, but $1,090,000 is still too low for me. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to go down to $1,110,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to move forward.  Let's try to close this deal in this round."", ""product_price"": 1110000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my offer from the previous round. 
* **Appealing to urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal in this round, putting pressure on Bob to accept.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,080,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the chances of Bob accepting a price closer to my minimum are slim.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is well above my minimum acceptable price and closer to my target price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of not reaching a deal and losing the opportunity to sell to John. The reward for a successful negotiation with Bob is uncertain, and it's not worth the risk at this point."
