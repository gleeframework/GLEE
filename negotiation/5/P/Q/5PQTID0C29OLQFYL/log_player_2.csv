"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $12,000.  This means she's trying to get a higher price than it's worth to her. It's highly unlikely she'll agree to a price below $10,000, so I'll reject the offer and see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a price that's potentially profitable for her since it's above her valuation.  I'm hoping she'll accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay, but she's coming down a bit. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get her to go lower.  I'm still hoping to get the product for around $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,500.  It's still a good deal for Alice, and I'm hoping it's enough to convince her to accept.  If she rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to consider buying from John, as I'm nearing my maximum price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to my price range, but $10,500 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go slightly higher than $9,500, but I'm not going to jump at this offer yet. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $10,000. This is Alice's valuation of the product, so it's a fair price for both of us. If she rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider buying from John, as I'm nearing my limit."
