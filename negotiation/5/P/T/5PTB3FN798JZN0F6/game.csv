"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $90? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $80.  Would you be willing to go down to $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $85? It's still a bit above your target, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",85.0,Alice,5,
