"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming to maximize profit, so starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) makes sense.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,400,000 price tag gives us room to negotiate downwards while still staying well above our minimum ($1,000,000) and John's offer. 
* **Positive Tone:**  We want to maintain a collaborative and positive tone with Bob throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a significant sum, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob clearly sees value in the product, and we have room to push back towards our initial offer.  We're aiming higher than his first counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still holding firm on a price above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** We reiterate the inherent value of the product to justify the higher price.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  By framing the counteroffer as a potential agreement point, we encourage Bob to move closer to our target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, Alice. I would like to counter your offer with $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which indicates he's willing to pay more than his initial counter-offer. We're still in a good position to negotiate, and while $1,325,000 is tempting, we can push for a slightly better deal.  We'll use the remaining rounds to try and nudge him closer to $1,340,000 or so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value here. I appreciate that. Let's make this happen â€“ how about we settle at $1,340,000 and call it a deal?"",
""product_price"": 1340000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong but Fair:**  We're holding firm on a price closer to our end goal while still acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By framing it as ""let's make this happen,"" we introduce a subtle sense of urgency without being overly aggressive. 
* **Clean Number:**  $1,340,000 feels like a more natural stopping point in the negotiation than $1,330,000 or similar."
