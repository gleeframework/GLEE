You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price from Alice.  $85 is a good starting point, but you can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $70. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still a fair price for a product I value at $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer. While $80 is closer to my ideal price, I think I can still push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm offering $75.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  Hopefully, she'll accept and we can close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to pay less, Alice is not budging much. At this point, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and buying from John would cost me significantly more. Accepting this offer is the best way to guarantee I get the product while still saving money."
