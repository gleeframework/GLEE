"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm Alice. I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $14,000. I believe it will be of great value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's opportunity to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $13,000?  This would give me a good price while still allowing you to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met Bob halfway with a price of $13,500. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he is getting the product for less than his maximum budget of $15,000.  There's a good chance Bob can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, but it's also a risk.  Accepting this offer guarantees a good deal and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer or the negotiation going on for too long."
