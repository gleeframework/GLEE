"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal.  There's significant room for negotiation, as the product is worth $800,000 to Alice and $1,200,000 to Bob. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to establish a lower starting point for his counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe $900,000 is a bit high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you and a good deal for me. Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm still willing to make a significant profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  Accepting the offer for $875,000 secures the product at a price well below Bob's maximum threshold of $1,200,000.  While further negotiation might be possible, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or Bob might need to resort to buying from John, which is a less desirable outcome."
