# Alice's message: Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value proposition and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential return on investment. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,150,000. This price reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $1,150,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the potential of this product.  Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
