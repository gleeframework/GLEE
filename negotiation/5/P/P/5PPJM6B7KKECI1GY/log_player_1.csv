Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value of this product, your initial offer is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  I'm confident that this price reflects the product's worth while also being fair to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $1,150,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the potential of this product.  Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, he's still significantly below our $1,000,000 minimum.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's acceptable within the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, ensuring we don't risk ending up with an even lower offer from Bob.  It's time to secure the guaranteed profit."
