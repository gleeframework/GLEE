Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 gives Bob a potential bargain while still leaving room for Alice to profit. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While this message doesn't explicitly invite negotiation, the tone is friendly and open, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he wants to. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit by first attempting a sale above the minimum Alice is willing to accept. If Bob rejects this offer, Alice has the security of selling to John at her desired minimum price."
