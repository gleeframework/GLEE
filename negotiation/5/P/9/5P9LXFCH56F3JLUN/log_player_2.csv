Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $700,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you, but $750,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's close this out and move forward.
