"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you. I'm offering it for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point. I'm pricing the product higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but not that much. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $80?  That's still a great deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $80, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $70 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80. Accepting this offer will ensure a sale and minimize the risk of further negotiation.  While selling to John for $80 would be slightly more profitable, there's no guarantee that future rounds will result in a higher price from Bob."
