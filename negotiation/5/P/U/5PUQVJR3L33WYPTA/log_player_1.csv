"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer downwards in the subsequent rounds.  However, I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm still trying to get a higher price, but I'm also aware that I need to be reasonable to avoid losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,200 is a good deal considering the remaining rounds.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a better price, but there's a risk of losing the sale altogether.  It's better to secure the sale at a price that is still profitable for me."
