Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset that's worth every penny. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's above what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for him to counteroffer.  It also expresses confidence in the product's value and sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a substantial amount, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $950,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
