Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a significantly higher price ($2,250,000) than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a much higher profit.
* **Confident Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product to justify the high asking price, even though I haven't revealed the specifics of Bob's valuation. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware that this high initial offer could be rejected. However, having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 provides me with a strong fallback position. This allows me to be bolder in my negotiation with Bob."
