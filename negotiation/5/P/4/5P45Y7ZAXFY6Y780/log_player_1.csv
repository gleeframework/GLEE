Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  This gives you room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to the product's value to Bob.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A much higher price might make Bob immediately walk away.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This avoids confusion and sets the tone for a professional negotiation. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum desired value of $800,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to the product's value to Bob, which is $1,500,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  This still gives you a significant savings compared to the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your goal.
* **Highlighting value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth reinforces the value of your offer. 
* **Staying firm:** While you're willing to negotiate, the price remains above your minimum, ensuring you still profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still below my initial desired price, it is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Considering Bob's budget constraints and the risk of him walking away completely, accepting his offer at $1,050,000 is the most logical choice. This ensures I still secure a profitable sale and avoid the potential for a prolonged negotiation or losing out to John's lower offer."
