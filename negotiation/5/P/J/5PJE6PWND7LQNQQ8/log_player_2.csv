# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you can potentially get a better price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000 and John is your backup option at that price, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal."
