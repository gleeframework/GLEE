"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on your product, $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in making a deal, but I'm only comfortable paying $85.  This would allow us both to benefit and finalize a transaction. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
