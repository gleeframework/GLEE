Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but the ""exclusive opportunity"" framing and mention of other buyers might make him reconsider. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial high price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to capitalize on the potential for a higher profit from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
