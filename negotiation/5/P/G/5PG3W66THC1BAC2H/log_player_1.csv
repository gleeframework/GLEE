Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will be telling. If he's immediately turned off, you know you may need to come down significantly. If he counters, it suggests he's seriously interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John at $15,000, which provides you with a strong fallback position."
