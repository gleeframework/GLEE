Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $10,000. This information is incredibly valuable in negotiations.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John. This gives you leverage, knowing you won't be left with the product if Bob declines. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perception:** While you know Bob's valuation, he doesn't know yours.  Your message aims to convey the product's value to justify the high price.
* **Negotiation Tactics:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can then decide if you want to negotiate down or stick closer to your initial offer.
* **Relationship Building:**  Even though you have a backup buyer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob can be beneficial for future interactions."
