"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's inherent value while still acknowledging your perspective.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $1,075,000.  The value of this product is truly significant.  My final offer is $1,090,000.  This represents a substantial profit for you while still respecting the product's worth.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm starting to think about buying from John. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1,075,000, the same price I offered earlier?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
