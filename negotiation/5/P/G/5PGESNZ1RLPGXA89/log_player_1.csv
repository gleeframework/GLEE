Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $1,200,000.  I know it's a significant investment, but I believe the value it can bring to your business is exceptional.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I want to try to squeeze a little more out of this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price,  $950,000 is still not acceptable. I want to see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your continued interest.  While I can't go as low as $950,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but it's the best I can do at this time. I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $980,000 is a good offer, I'm running out of time and I'm worried that Bob might not meet my minimum price in the remaining rounds. To avoid losing out on a good opportunity, I'll go with John's offer of $1,000,000."
