"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your needs perfectly. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $120. Considering its high worth to you, this might be an excellent opportunity to acquire it at this exclusive price. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product, and John is offering it for that price. Alice is also offering it for $120.  There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer since you can get the same product for the same price from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to explore other options or potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price in the future."
