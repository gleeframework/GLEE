"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair offer, considering its value to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $7,500. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer it to you for $10,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value I've already added to the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
