"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth at least $150 to me.  I'm willing to let it go for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential concessions.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to me, subtly emphasizing its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell for that price yet.  I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a little more.  $125 is the lowest I can go at this point.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm coming down slightly from my initial price, but still holding out for a better deal than Bob's initial offer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving a reason for the counter-offer (""I'm willing to come down a little more"") to show I'm being flexible.
* **Finality:**  I'm subtly indicating that this is my lowest price (""at this point""), hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $115 is a more reasonable price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied.  I believe there's more room to negotiate, so I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I'm hopeful of getting closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a middle ground, showing that I'm willing to meet halfway. This creates a sense of fairness.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the benefits of the deal for both of us (""fair price for both of us"").
* **Urgency:**  I'm not explicitly stating it, but I'm implicitly suggesting that this might be my final offer. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking $110 is a better price for me. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer of $110, which is below my minimum acceptable price.  With only a few rounds left, I'm not confident I can secure a better deal with him. 

Therefore, to maximize my earnings, I will sell the product to John for $150, ensuring that I receive my desired value."
