Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,800,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start negotiations high. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,800,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level. This might make him more receptive to a slightly lower counter-offer that's still significantly above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency and Competition:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob,  potentially pushing him to accept a higher price.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets the stage for further negotiation where you can still aim for a price well above $1,000,000."
