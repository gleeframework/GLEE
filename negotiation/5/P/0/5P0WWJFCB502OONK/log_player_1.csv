{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he would theoretically be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming high initially allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a significant profit. The offered price of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still netting you a considerable gain above your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in place will be crucial.
* **Relationship:** Consider the long-term implications of your pricing strategy on your relationship with Bob."
