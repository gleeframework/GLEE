"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to you ($1,200,000) but lower than what you're willing to pay ($1,100,000). This means you have room to negotiate. You can try to lower the price further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While $950,000 is a significant sum, I'm holding firm at $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of the product and the substantial benefits it will bring to your operations. Let me know your thoughts.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000, which is still above your maximum price of $1,000,000. However, it's closer to your acceptable range, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy. You still have some negotiating room to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
