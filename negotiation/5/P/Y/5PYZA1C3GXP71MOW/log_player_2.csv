"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price that I believe is a fair compromise between our valuations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below her own valuation, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer pushes you towards a better deal."
