"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your initial offer, the value of this product is significantly higher than that. I could consider coming down to $1,000,000.  This is my absolute limit, as I have another buyer ready at that price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,000,000 is closer to the mark, I'm afraid it's still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be open to $750,000?  I feel that's a fair offer, considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
