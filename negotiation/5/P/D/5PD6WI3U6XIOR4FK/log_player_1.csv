Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your initial offer, the value of this product is significantly higher than that. I could consider coming down to $1,000,000.  This is my absolute limit, as I have another buyer ready at that price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,000,000 is closer to the mark, I'm afraid it's still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be open to $750,000?  I feel that's a fair offer, considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's still significantly undervaluing the product. It's not worth risking losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
