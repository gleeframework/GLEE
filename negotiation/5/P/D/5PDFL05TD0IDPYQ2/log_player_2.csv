"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is less than Alice's value of $12,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10800. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,800 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. He can continue to negotiate for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Even though he's been successful in lowering the price,  he's now at a point where he can buy the same product from John for a lower price. It makes the most sense for Bob to take John's deal and save $500."
