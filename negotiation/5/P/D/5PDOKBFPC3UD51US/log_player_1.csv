"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm taking a gamble that he might be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm now  within a range I'm comfortable with.  While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle with John.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
