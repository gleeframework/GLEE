"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product for a price that's below its true value, and I get a good deal while still valuing the product highly. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $950,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000 - I'm sure you'll agree it's still a great price for such a valuable product.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can agree to this price.",925000.0,Bob,4,
