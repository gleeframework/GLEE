Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to sell the product, $850,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can agree to this price.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $925,000 is a decent compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price, and Bob seems committed to buying at this price.  I'll accept his offer."
