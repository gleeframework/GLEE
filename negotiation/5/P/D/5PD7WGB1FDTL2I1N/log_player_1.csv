Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob might reject it. This allows me to gauge his interest and negotiate from a strong position.  I'll be ready to counter his offers if he comes back with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000.  This is closer to Bob's offer, and I'm hoping he'll see that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below my minimum of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not going to budge on his price, and I'm not willing to drop below my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to sell to John and secure the $1,000,000 than risk further negotiation and potentially get a lower price from Bob."
