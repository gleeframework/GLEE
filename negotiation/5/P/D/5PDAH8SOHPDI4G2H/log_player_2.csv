Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand it's a bit of a gap from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $90 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  To be honest, I have another offer for $150.  If you're able to meet that price, the product is yours.  Otherwise, I'll need to consider the other offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking close to her valuation of $150 and even mentions another offer at that price.  It's unlikely she'll go down significantly. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $100 and avoid potentially wasting more time negotiating."
