"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand it's a bit of a gap from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"It seems like we're still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to come up a bit to $90, but that's about as high as I can go.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $90 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  To be honest, I have another offer for $150.  If you're able to meet that price, the product is yours.  Otherwise, I'll need to consider the other offer.",150.0,Alice,5,
