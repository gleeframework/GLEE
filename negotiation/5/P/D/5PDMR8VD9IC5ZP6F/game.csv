"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to me. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is far too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you're getting the product for significantly less than it's worth to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would allow me to acquire the product within my price range.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit while ensuring you get a great deal. Let's finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your constraints. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's close this now.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move on.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
