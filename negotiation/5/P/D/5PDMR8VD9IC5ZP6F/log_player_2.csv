Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you're getting the product for significantly less than it's worth to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit while ensuring you get a great deal. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is getting closer to my price range, but $1,300,000 is still a little too high. I'm going to try to get her down further before I consider buying from John."
