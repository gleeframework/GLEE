Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer sets a price that is higher than your minimum acceptable value, but also leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob is willing to pay more than $8,000, he might be willing to pay $9,000.  If he's not, you can always fall back on selling to John for your minimum price."
