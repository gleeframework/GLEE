"I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",115.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $115 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a little more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $120?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good deal.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $120. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",110.0,Bob,4,
