Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while my asking price is $1,150,000, I'm open to discussing a figure that benefits both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going below our own $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have the security of John's offer, so there's no pressure to accept a lowball offer from Bob.

**Important:** This strategy assumes we don't know Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above $1,000,000."
