Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your budget considerations, but $1,400,000 is already significantly less than what I believe the product is truly worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects the product's inherent value while still offering you a good deal.  What do you say?
