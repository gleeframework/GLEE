Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you.,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10500. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $11800. This is a reasonable compromise, taking into account the value it holds for both of us.",11800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's try to finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
