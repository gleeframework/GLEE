Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $12,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000), but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).  
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and encouraging. I emphasize the value for Bob and show confidence in the deal. 
* **Strategy:**  This starting price allows for negotiation but also gives me a good starting point.  I'm open to making counteroffers if Bob rejects, but I also have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get a better price.  I'm not desperate and have the option to sell to John for a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $11,250, which is the midpoint between my last offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This shows flexibility while still staying within my acceptable range.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing a desire to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm framing the $11,250 as a fair compromise. 
* **Strategy:** By splitting the difference, I'm hoping to show good faith and incentivize Bob to accept. If he still rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
