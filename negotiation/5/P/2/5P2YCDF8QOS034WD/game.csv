"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately far below what I can accept.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great price for the product, and it's within my acceptable range.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be open to $7,500? I think that would be a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still too low for me. To be completely honest, I'm not sure I can go any lower than $8,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a fair profit.  I believe this is our best chance to reach an agreement. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
