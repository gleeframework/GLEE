This offer gives me a good chance of making a higher profit than selling to John, while still being attractive to Bob. 

Here's the logic:

* **My minimum:**  I won't go below $10,000 because that's my minimum value.
* **Bob's maximum:**  Bob is only willing to pay $8,000.
* **John's value:**  John is willing to pay $10,000, creating a safety net if Bob rejects.

Offering $9,500 gives Bob a better deal than John, potentially tempting him to accept.  It also gives me a decent profit margin."
