"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to walk away if this doesn't work out.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to make a deal,  $750,000 is below my bottom line.  Could you do $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $925,000 is not a good fit for my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $800,000. I've already spoken to another seller who is willing to sell it to me for this price, so I'm not willing to go any higher.",800000.0,Bob,4,
