{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for you given your own valuation.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
