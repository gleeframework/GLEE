"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that will be a significant benefit to you. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its worth to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows for a good profit margin for me while still being a great value for you considering the product's potential.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about finding a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, but I believe it reflects the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $962,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's reach an agreement.",962500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $962,500. I'm willing to meet you at $955,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",955000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm ready to make one final concession. I'm willing to accept your offer of $955,000.  Let's wrap this up and finalize the deal.",955000.0,Alice,9,
