"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum ($120).
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and encouraging tone helps build rapport and increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not setting a hardline price, so there's room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $105. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $120, which is my minimum. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $115 to $110. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that he's getting a good deal even at this price.
* **Keeping the Door Open:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, but I'm also setting a clear price expectation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $108? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I appreciate Bob's willingness to meet halfway, it's not enough for me to close the deal at this point. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still some room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and willing to pay more than his initial offer. 
* **John is a Safe Alternative:** Selling to John for $120 remains a viable option if we can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob. 

I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to go down to $112, which is a good compromise for both of us.  This is still a very fair price for the value you're getting.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):**  I'm offering a price that's almost halfway between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $108. This shows I'm flexible and willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that he's getting a good deal even at this price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $108. Would you be willing to meet me at $109? I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer of $109 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Few rounds left:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my target.
* **John is the safer option:** Selling to John for $120 is a secure option.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds.

I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $109 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $111?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets me move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 111}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a final compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer of $112 and Bob's offer of $109.  This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway and shows a commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing the Deal:** I'm reminding Bob that this price is a good deal for him, considering the value of the product.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly suggesting that this is my final offer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are down to three rounds, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my target.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm more likely to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $109. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are down to two rounds. It's unlikely we'll reach a better price in the remaining time.
* **John is a Safe Alternative:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $120.

While I'd prefer a higher price, it's more beneficial to accept this offer and secure the sale than to risk losing both Bob and John as buyers."
