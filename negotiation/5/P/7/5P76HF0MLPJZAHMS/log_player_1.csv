Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is significantly higher than John's offer, leaving room for potential negotiation, but also secures a profit significantly above my minimum requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I will counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway and increasing the potential profit while still being significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll see if I can get a better deal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to meet Bob's last offer, but only if he's willing to go to 1,300,000. This price is still above my minimum and I feel we can close the deal here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm concerned we're getting stuck in a stalemate. It's unlikely he'll go any higher.  It's time to secure the sale with John and guarantee a profit."
