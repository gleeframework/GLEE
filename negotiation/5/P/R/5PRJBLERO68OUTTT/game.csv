"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $105 for this product. Let's split the difference and I'll do $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
