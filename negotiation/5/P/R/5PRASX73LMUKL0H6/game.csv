"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your starting price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is quite low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could potentially go up to $9,000, but that's really the top of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9,000, but I'm still not sure that's enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $18,000, which is $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground here. However, that price is still a bit too high for me. I can stretch my budget to $9,500, but that's really the absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you halfway between $9,500 and $18,000, which is $13,750. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,7,
