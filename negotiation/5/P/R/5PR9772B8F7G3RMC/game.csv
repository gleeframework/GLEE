"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,750, as I believe this is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,600.  I really think this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8600.0,Bob,4,
