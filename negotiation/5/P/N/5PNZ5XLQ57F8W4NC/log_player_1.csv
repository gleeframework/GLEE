Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** $900,000 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This leaves you room to potentially negotiate down to a price that is still acceptable to you.
* **It shows you're serious:** This offer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate with Bob rather than immediately going to John.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is significantly less than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's still interested. This gives you an opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance you could get closer to that price by negotiating further with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you maintain leverage and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to consider a price closer to the middle ground. I'm prepared to lower my price to $850,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's but lower than your minimum:** This keeps the negotiation moving while still protecting your interests.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  By highlighting a ""middle ground"" and ""fair deal,"" you appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Maintain flexibility:**  This counteroffer still gives you room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $820,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your minimum:** While $820,000 is still below your ideal price of $1,000,000, it's only $80,000 away.  
* **Negotiation is getting lengthy:**  Continuing to negotiate risks further lowering the price and also takes time. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  You can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so accepting Bob's offer provides a decent return with less risk and effort. 

This situation presents a good opportunity to close the deal and secure a relatively good price."
