"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my desired price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than what John is offering.  There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice when he can get the product for a lower price from John."
