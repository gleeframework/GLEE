# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Alice's offer is a good deal, but there's a chance I can get a better price. By rejecting her offer, I might incentivize her to lower the price even further. I'm willing to risk going to John (my $15,000 backup plan) for the potential of saving an additional amount."
