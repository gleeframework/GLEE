"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750.  This is a fair price that's closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal here.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,750 is closer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher number. Would you consider $8,900? This would be a great price for both of us.",8900.0,Alice,5,
