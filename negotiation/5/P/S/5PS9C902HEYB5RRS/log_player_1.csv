Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal and would be very useful to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, I want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down slightly while still getting me a better profit than John. 
* **High but Appealing:** The price is high, but the message attempts to frame it as a ""deal,"" potentially swaying Bob if he's particularly interested in the product.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might find $119 too high. However, this strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit, knowing I have a fallback option with John."
