Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth $8,000 to you, and to be fair, I wouldn't sell it for any less than that.  How about we settle at $8,500?"", 
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You have valuable information â€“ you know the product's worth to Bob is $8,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $8,500 leaves some space for negotiation. Bob might try to counter-offer, but you've set a firm floor at $8,000.
* **Backup Plan (John):**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum."
