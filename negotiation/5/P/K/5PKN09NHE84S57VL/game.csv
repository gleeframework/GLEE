"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to stay within a budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to me and your minimum price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $1100000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.
