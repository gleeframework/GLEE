Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a higher final price. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving you leverage in the negotiation.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while maintaining a professional and appealing offer to Bob."
