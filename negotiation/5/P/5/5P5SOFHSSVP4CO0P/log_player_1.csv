Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $15,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($19,000) allows for potential negotiation while still leaving room to go down to a price that's profitable for you. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed as a potential deal for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might reject a higher offer. However, this strategy balances risk and potential reward, as you have a safety net with John's offer."
