Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $110. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's important to be aggressive early on to try and establish a lower starting point for the negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $120. I'll continue to negotiate and hope for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to offer Alice my maximum price of $120.  Since I have the option of buying from John for this price, I don't want to go any higher. If Alice accepts, it's a win for me. If she rejects, I can always switch to John."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, even though it's lower than her previous offers.  Since I have the option to buy from John for $120, it's more advantageous to go with John.  It's not worth risking further rounds of negotiation when I can get the product at my target price from John."
