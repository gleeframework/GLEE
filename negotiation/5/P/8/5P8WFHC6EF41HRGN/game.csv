"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not ready to accept $850,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I believe the product holds. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good return on your investment. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
