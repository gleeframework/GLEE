{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This leaves room for negotiation and makes the offer attractive to him.
* **It leaves space for potential counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, we can likely do better.  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to pay a premium, so it's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we meet at $12,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12,000. I'd like to try to get even closer to my target price. How about we meet at $11,500? It's a small step closer to my ideal price, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is a good deal. It's higher than what John is offering, and it's close enough to our desired price that it's worth accepting. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a higher price, but it's also risky, and we could end up with a lower price or even losing the sale altogether.  It's best to take the guaranteed profit at this point."
