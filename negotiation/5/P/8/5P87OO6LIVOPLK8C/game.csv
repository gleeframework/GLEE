,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we meet at $12,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12,000. I'd like to try to get even closer to my target price. How about we meet at $11,500? It's a small step closer to my ideal price, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
