"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm thinking of $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm finding it hard to justify $11,000.  I'd be willing to move up slightly to $10,000, but that's truly the best I can do.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up to $10,000, but I'm still not convinced that's a good enough price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $11,250. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. To be completely honest,  $10,500 is the absolute highest I can go. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is the highest you're willing to go, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet in the middle. I'll come down to $11,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal at this price. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",11000.0,Alice,9,
