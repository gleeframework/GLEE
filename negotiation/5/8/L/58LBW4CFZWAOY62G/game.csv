"Thank you for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $12000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your maximum is $12000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort, but $16000 is still beyond my budget. I'm really determined to get this product, and I'm confident it's a great investment.  Let's split the difference and finalize this at $14000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're determined to get the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $15500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,7,
