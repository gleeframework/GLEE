```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your maximum is $12000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $16000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. While it's closer than before, I want to try and see if I can get her down to my target price of $12,000. It's worth negotiating a little longer before resorting to buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort, but $16,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm really determined to get this product, and I'm confident it's a great investment.  Let's split the difference and finalize this at $14,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing a price halfway between my last offer and Alice's offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a firm stance.  I'm emphasizing the positive aspects of the product to make Alice more inclined to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're determined to get the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $15500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she's not willing to go below $15,500. This is still above my budget, and with only a few rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate.  It's better to buy from John at $12,000, which guarantees I get the product within my budget."
