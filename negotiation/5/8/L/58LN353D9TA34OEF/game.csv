"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $950,000 is a bit above my budget.  Let's start with a price of $850,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the value to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
