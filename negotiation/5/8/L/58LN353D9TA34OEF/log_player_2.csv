"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $950,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  While John's price is higher, it's a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $950,000 is a bit above my budget.  Let's start with a price of $850,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above Bob's target:**  $900,000 is still more than Bob wants to pay.
* **Continuing negotiation:**  There's room to bargain further.  
* **John is still an option:**  Bob can always buy from John as a last resort."
