{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You haven't gathered any information about the product's value to Alice.  Rejecting allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a bold opening counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. It's designed to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and understand their bottom line. This offer gives Alice ample room to counter while still ensuring you are negotiating within your desired price range."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, so it's time to raise your offer.  A $1,100,000 counteroffer is still significantly lower than her latest offer, but it shows you're willing to move closer to a compromise. This allows for further negotiation and potentially a middle ground."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to come down in price, but you're still within your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better price. While John is a backup option, it's worth exploring if you can get a lower price from Alice."
