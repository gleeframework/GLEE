Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable buying the product from another seller for that price. Let me know if you're willing to accept.

I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to the value it holds for me. I'll meet you at $825,000, but I need you to throw in some extras or guarantees to make it worth my while. If not, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 825000}"
