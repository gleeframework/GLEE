"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $950,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I can meet you in the middle at $825,000, considering the product's value to you. This is my best compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $825,000, but I'm still a bit too far apart.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable buying the product from another seller for that price. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to walk away at $800,000, but I'm not willing to accept that price. I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to the value it holds for me. I'll meet you at $825,000, but I need you to throw in some extras or guarantees to make it worth my while. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
