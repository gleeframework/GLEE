"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within his budget, it's not the best deal.  He can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget.** While he'd prefer a lower price,  $102 is still a good deal compared to John's offer of $120.
* **Time is a factor.**  With 7 rounds left, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a higher price. 
* **The middle ground.**  Alice has shown willingness to compromise, making accepting her offer a logical choice."
