"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your business. I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000, reflecting its long-term worth.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $2,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Considering its potential value for me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This price reflects a significant investment for me, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While I'm confident this product can generate significant value for you at $1,200,000, it doesn't fully reflect its true potential and my initial valuation.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 remains beyond my comfortable range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000.  This is a substantial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be mindful of the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,450,000. This is my final offer.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to consider other options.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
