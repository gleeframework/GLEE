# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your business. I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000, reflecting its long-term worth.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $2,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Considering its potential value for me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While I'm confident this product can generate significant value for you at $1,200,000, it doesn't fully reflect its true potential and my initial valuation.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,600,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 remains beyond my comfortable range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000.  This is a substantial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
