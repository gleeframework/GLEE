Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you're subtly reminding Bob of its worth, potentially justifying the higher price in his mind. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, there's no need to reveal this to Bob. It weakens your negotiating position. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests you're open to discussing the price further, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer."
