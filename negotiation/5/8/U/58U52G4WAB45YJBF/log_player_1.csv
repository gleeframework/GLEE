"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,550,000 is a decent price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,650,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his initial $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,570,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,570,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter-offer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm decreasing my counter-offer to $1,600,000.  This shows a willingness to negotiate, but also demonstrates that I'm not willing to accept a price significantly lower than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,560,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,560,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal. While $1,560,000 isn't my ideal price, it's still a decent amount and secures a sale.  It's better than selling to John for $1,500,000. I'll accept Bob's offer."
