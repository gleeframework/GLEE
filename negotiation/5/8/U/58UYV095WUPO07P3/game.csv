"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in your product, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my spending limit.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,275,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product while still being reasonable. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,275,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of your product while staying within my financial limits. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still hesitant to go above $1,250,000, Bob. However, I want to emphasize that our product is a unique opportunity that can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $1,260,000. This is as close as I can get to your budget while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1260000.0,Alice,5,
