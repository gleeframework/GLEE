"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer of $90. Our product is valued at $120 by you, and we aim to maintain a fair pricing strategy that respects both our business interests and the perceived value of our products. We would like to offer you the product at $105, which we believe strikes a balance between our valuation and your budget.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $95. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay, and I'm still interested in purchasing the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. While we would ideally like to maintain our product's original asking price, I understand the constraints of your budget. We are willing to consider a price of $100 for the product, which is just slightly above your proposed counteroffer. This allows us to maintain a fair valuation while also accommodating your financial considerations. We hope this proposal meets your expectations.",100.0,Alice,5,
