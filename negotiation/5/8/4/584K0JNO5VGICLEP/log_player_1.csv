Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product.  I believe it would be very valuable to you.  How about a price of $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $115 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** $115 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring a good profit.

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic chance of Bob accepting the offer."
