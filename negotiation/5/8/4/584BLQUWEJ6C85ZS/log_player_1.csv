Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and leaves room for us both to profit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. However, $1,025,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.

This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
