You can definitely do better than $1,200,000.  It's worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."

Alice is coming down, but it's still higher than my ideal price. I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of the deal."

Alice has come down significantly, and we're getting close to my ideal price. Accepting this offer means I can buy the product for $1,280,000, which is a good deal considering my budget. I could keep negotiating, but the risk of losing the deal to John and paying $1,500,000 is too high."
