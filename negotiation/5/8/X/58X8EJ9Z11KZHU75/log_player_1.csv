Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't just throw out a number. It emphasizes ""value and potential,"" hinting at reasons why the price is above what Bob might initially expect.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is polite and professional, inviting Bob to engage in discussion rather than issuing an ultimatum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:** This strategy assumes Alice has some knowledge about typical profit margins or price flexibility for products like hers. 
* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob to be extremely price-sensitive, she might adjust her strategy. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice is under time pressure to sell, she might lower her asking price to ensure a quicker sale to Bob."
