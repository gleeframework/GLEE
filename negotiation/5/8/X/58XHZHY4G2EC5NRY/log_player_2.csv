"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would really benefit you. I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.**  You're willing to spend up to $10,000, and Alice is asking for $9,500.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a fallback option.**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you can still buy the product from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's tempting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my original price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your target.** You're aiming for a price below $9,000, and she's now offering $9,250.
* **There's a good chance you won't get a lower price.**  Further negotiation might take time and could risk Alice getting a better offer from someone else.
* **John is still a backup.** You can still buy from John for $10,000, so accepting Alice's offer gives you a $750 saving."
