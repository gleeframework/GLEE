"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",7800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to see eye-to-eye on this. $7,800 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I accept $8,200? This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",8200.0,Alice,5,
