"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are still a bit far apart.  I'd be willing to go up to $760,000.  Do you think that would work?",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I can tell you're serious, so I'm willing to come down a bit more to $825,000.  That's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest,  $800,000 is about as high as I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
