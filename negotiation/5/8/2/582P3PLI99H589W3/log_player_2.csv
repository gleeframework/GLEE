**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* Even though you could potentially get a better deal from John, accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000. 
* This decision aligns with your goal of saving as much money as possible while still acquiring the product."
