"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You have a significant buffer ($500,000) before reaching the price of John's offer. By rejecting the offer, you can gauge Alice's willingness to drop the price and potentially secure a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's unique value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $1,000,000 to $900,000, which is a good sign. However, there's still room for negotiation. You're still comfortable with a price below $1,000,000, and rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your initial counteroffer of $750,000."
