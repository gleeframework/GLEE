"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. He has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible and knows he has a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to immediately show Alice his serious intent to negotiate and establish a lower starting point. He knows Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation. This initial offer leaves room for further compromise while still demonstrating a willingness to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, Bob is still within his goal of saving as much money as possible.  Since he has a fallback option of buying from John for $1,000,000, he's not under pressure to accept Alice's offer yet.  By rejecting the offer, he can continue to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now close to his target price of $1,000,000 and has a clear alternative with John. This offer is a compromise, demonstrating his willingness to meet Alice halfway. He's betting that Alice, wanting to close the deal and potentially seeing the urgency in Bob's offer, will accept. If she doesn't, he can always purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's target price, and he has a clear alternative with John. Accepting this offer means securing the product for a slightly higher price than his initial goal, but it guarantees the deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential price increases. It's a good balance between saving money and closing the deal within a reasonable time frame."
