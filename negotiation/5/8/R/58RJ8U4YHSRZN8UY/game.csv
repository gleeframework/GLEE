"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $102.50?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $102.50, which would be $96.25. Can you consider that?",96.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $96.25 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is the midpoint between our last two offers.  Let's close this deal and get you the product you want.",100.0,Alice,5,
