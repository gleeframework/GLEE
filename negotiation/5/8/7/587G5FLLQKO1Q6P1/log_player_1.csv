"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is truly interested and to leave room for negotiation. I believe the product is worth more than $15,000 to me, and I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $18,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000.  This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $17,500 is getting close to my minimum, and we're already on round 4.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers, especially with John waiting in the wings. I'll take the $17,500 and close the deal."
