Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you recognize its true value, and I believe  $950,000 is a fair price that reflects its worth.  Let me know your decision - this offer stands for the next 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The 24-hour limit adds a bit of pressure and might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:** By stating you ""believe $950,000 is a fair price that reflects its worth,"" you subtly imply the product might be worth even more.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insight into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., is he easily offended by high prices?), adjust accordingly. 
* **Risk Tolerance:**  A higher offer has the potential for higher profit but also increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.

**Remember:** This is just one strategy. You can experiment with different prices and messages to see what yields the best results in your negotiation with Bob."
