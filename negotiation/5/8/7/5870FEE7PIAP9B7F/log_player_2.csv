"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($100):** This is within your budget of $120 and saves you $20 compared to buying from John.
* **John's offer ($120):** While this is your maximum budget, it's not as favorable as Alice's offer.

Since Alice's offer is a better deal, it's the logical choice to accept it."
