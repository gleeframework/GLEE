"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's still a good deal for me (since it's below the product's worth to Alice), I want to see if I can get a better price.  Rejecting her offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,325,000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,325,000 is within my budget, and still a good deal considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially driving the price up again is not worth it. Accepting her offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
