"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in.  It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice. $100 is still a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively low counteroffer to try and gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  There's a chance she accepts it outright, but even if she doesn't, it gives us room to move upward in future rounds while staying well below my $120 maximum."
