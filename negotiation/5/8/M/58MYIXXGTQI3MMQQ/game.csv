"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a little, but $150 is simply too low for me. How about $175? It's a great deal for a product like this.  Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still not sure if $175 is within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160?",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  $160 is closer, but I'm still a bit too far from my target.  How about we split the difference and go with $165? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think!",165.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $165 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $155?",155.0,Bob,6,
