I am rejecting Bob's offer.  Even though I am getting closer to my minimum price, it is still below my value for the product and I believe I can get closer to my ideal price in the next round."

I'm choosing to sell to John. While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, we are nearing the end of the rounds and I'm not confident I can reach my minimum value of $12,000 with him. Selling to John guarantees me that amount, and I'd rather take the sure thing than risk a lower price with Bob."
