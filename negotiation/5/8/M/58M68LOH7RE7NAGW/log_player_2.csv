Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while also allowing you to make a profit. Let's find common ground.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However,  $975,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down to her minimum price of $1,000,000.  This is the same price John is offering. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice as it's unlikely she'll go any lower. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
