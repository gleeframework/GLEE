Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. It's a fair price considering its value to you.,140.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $140 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we split the difference and settle on $120?  It's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
