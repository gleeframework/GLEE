Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation. I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob. If he rejects this offer, I can always go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
``` 
I'm countering with $9,750. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $9,600 is a good price, considering my minimum desired price is $8,000.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only prolong the process and might not result in a significantly better price.  It's better to secure a good deal now."
