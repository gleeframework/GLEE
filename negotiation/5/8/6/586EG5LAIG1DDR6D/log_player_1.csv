Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $175. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I'd accept from John, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the potential ""steal"" for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which could lead to a higher price.
* **Keeping John as a backup:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can always sell to John for $150, guaranteeing at least some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and my starting offer of $175. 
* **Opportunity for better negotiation:**  I can likely get a better price by counter-offering and continuing the negotiation. 
* **John is still an option:** If I can't get a better deal from Bob, I can still sell to John for $150, so I'm not losing out on the opportunity cost."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $160.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's offer but still below my initial offer, showing flexibility while maintaining my profit margin.
* **Positive and encouraging language:**  I acknowledge Bob's interest and express willingness to compromise, creating a positive negotiation tone.
* **Focus on value:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify my counteroffer, making it seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I end the message by asking for Bob's thoughts, implying I'm open to further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is just $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  rejecting this offer and counter-offering again might risk losing Bob entirely.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I still have the option to sell to John for $150 if I'm unable to reach a better deal with Bob. 

In this situation, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the potential of a drawn-out negotiation that could ultimately lead to a lower price or no sale at all."
