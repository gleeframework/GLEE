"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. My asking price is $17,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  There's no point in accepting her initial offer. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $17,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $12,000? I'm genuinely interested in the product, but that's my maximum budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message provides a clear reason for the lower price and expresses interest in the product.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  A lower counteroffer encourages Alice to consider your offer seriously, while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further but not at that price point. I can always buy from John for a guaranteed $10,000, so it's worth seeing if I can get Alice lower before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $13,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be able to finalize the purchase quickly. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:**  I'm increasing my offer from $12,000 to $13,000, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Time pressure:**  Mentioning a quick purchase can incentivize Alice to accept.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize that this price would be beneficial for both of us.
* **Still under budget:**  My offer is still below my maximum budget of $10,000, so I'm not taking a significant risk."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant about $13,000.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This would be a good compromise, and we can finalize the deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point. I'm committed to saving as much money as possible. I have the option to buy from John for a guaranteed $10,000, so I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a lower price. There are still 5 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still sticking to my budget of $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal now.  If we can't agree on this, I'm ready to move forward with another seller."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm stance:**  I'm reiterating my $13,000 offer, showing that I'm not willing to go higher.
* **Time pressure:**  I emphasize that a quick deal can be made.
* **Alternative option:**  I remind Alice that I have an alternative seller (John) which reinforces my commitment to saving money. 

This strategy aims to make Alice feel the pressure of potential lost revenue, encouraging her to accept my offer."
