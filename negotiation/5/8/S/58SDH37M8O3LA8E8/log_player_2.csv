"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth accepting Alice's offer at $1,200,000.  You can get the product from John for less.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives you a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

I'm going to start by offering Alice my maximum price.  If she rejects this, I can move on to buying from John without any further negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice is still too high.  I'll reject her offer and see if we can negotiate further.  I'm still willing to pay up to $800,000, but I'll keep pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to offer a little more than my maximum, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation.  Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will be tempting enough for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still coming in too high.  I'm going to reject her offer and see if we can get closer to my target price.  I still have a few rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying under $1,000,000.  This is a good compromise and hopefully Alice will recognize that we are both getting close to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above my target price. I'm going to reject her offer and see if we can get even closer in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product.  I'm also getting closer to my maximum price, but there's still a little room for negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While it's still a bit higher than I'd like, Alice is getting closer to my target price. With only one round left, it's not worth risking losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at $800,000. I'll accept the offer and secure the product."
