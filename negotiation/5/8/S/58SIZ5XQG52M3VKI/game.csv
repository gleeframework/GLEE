"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $20,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to something closer to my budget, perhaps around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  This product is worth a lot, and I'm confident it can bring you value beyond even $15,000. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still hesitant to go above $12,000. Could we possibly negotiate down to $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
