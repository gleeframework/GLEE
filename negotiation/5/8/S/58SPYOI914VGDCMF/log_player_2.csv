"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $120 to you and Alice is offering it for $100, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved up slightly from her initial offer, but it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $105 is closer to your limit, but you can likely get it down further.  Rejecting the offer will allow you to try again with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  $105 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $97.50. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. How about we try $102.50? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's counteroffer of $102.50 is getting closer to your ideal price, and it's a good compromise.  It's still within your budget, and you've already made multiple counteroffers, so it's likely you won't be able to get a much lower price.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product while saving some money compared to buying from John."
