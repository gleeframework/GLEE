"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  $105 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $97.50. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. How about we try $102.50? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",102.5,Alice,5,
