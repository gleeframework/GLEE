"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,280,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,280,000 is still a little high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,260,000? This is a fair compromise, and it leaves some room for us to finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 1260000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,260,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,270,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,270,000 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $1,260,000.  This is a good compromise for both parties.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product for a reasonable price, while also saving him money compared to buying from John.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will result in a significantly lower price, and there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal."
