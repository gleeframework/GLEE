"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $10,000? It's a fair offer considering my budget constraints.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $11,500? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and your budget constraints. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly. How about $12,000 even?  That's the absolute limit of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob! However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,200. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and your budget constraints. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,7,
