"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I see in the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
