"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your interest in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, and I'll offer the product for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me. $825,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $780,000.  Would you be willing to meet me around there?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'll offer the product for $812,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  While it's not the $780,000 you were aiming for, $812,500 is a reasonable compromise, and continuing to negotiate might risk the deal entirely."
