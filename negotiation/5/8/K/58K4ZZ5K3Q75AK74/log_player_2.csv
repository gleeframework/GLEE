While $125 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you at $115, which is still a good deal for both of us.
