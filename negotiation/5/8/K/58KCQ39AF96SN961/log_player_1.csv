Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  The product sounds interesting, but I'm looking to invest a bit less than that. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. This aligns with my budget and allows room for a profitable return. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
