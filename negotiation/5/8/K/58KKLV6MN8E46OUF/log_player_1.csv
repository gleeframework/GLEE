"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is significantly above my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for this product.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to accept. However, I'm not desperate to sell. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my original offer, but it's still higher than Bob's current offer. I'm hoping to meet him halfway and close the deal."
