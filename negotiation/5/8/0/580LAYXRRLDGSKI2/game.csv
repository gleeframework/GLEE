"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to accept $1100000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know if you're interested.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
