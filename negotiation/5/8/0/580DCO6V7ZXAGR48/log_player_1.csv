{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I know it would be incredibly valuable to your operation.  I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000. This is a very competitive price considering its potential return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I believe this product would be valuable for me, but the price is a little high.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value it holds for you while still being a fair deal for me."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position on the value, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed offer. There's no benefit to risking further negotiation for a potentially small gain. Accepting $1,200,000 now is the safest and most logical choice."
