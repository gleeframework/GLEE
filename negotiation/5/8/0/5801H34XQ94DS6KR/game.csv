"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $780,000, considering your interest.  This is still a great value for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's worth.  Let's meet in the middle.",780000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $780,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $740,000 is a more reasonable price for me. Can we discuss further?",740000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $740,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $760,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize this.",760000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure I'm willing to go up to $760,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I don't want to overpay for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",750000.0,Bob,6,
