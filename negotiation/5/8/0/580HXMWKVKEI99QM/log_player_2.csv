"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob. There's potential to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm confident this is a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he's still aiming for a lower price. There's room to negotiate further and possibly get closer to his $10,000 target. It's worth trying another counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $10,500 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's try $11,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking to $11,000. Bob has already rejected her offer at this price, but it's a better deal than buying from John.  At this point, it's likely that Alice won't budge further.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with, saving him money compared to buying from John.  He's also limited to only 5 more rounds, which increases the risk of not getting a deal at all if he rejects."
