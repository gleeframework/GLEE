Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($120).  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $100 allows room for negotiation, as Bob's maximum willingness to pay is $80.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and positive message can help create a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120 and even lower than my initial offer.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob is interested, I believe there is room to negotiate a higher price. 
* **John as backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $120 gives me the flexibility to hold out for a better price from Bob without risking selling below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  $65 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85?  I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  My counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a profitable sale. 
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm suggesting $85, which is halfway between Bob's offer ($65) and my previous offer ($100). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language (""appreciate"", ""fair price"") to maintain a friendly tone and encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
