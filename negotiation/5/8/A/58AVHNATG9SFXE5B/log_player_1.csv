"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I think the product is a great opportunity, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too far below what I'm willing to accept. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a good deal for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, $9,500 is still below my minimum. I will reject Bob's offer and try to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $10,000 is still below my minimum. I will reject his offer and try to squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,250. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we try $9,750? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're at the end of round 8, and it's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to go much higher.  While $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000, which is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
