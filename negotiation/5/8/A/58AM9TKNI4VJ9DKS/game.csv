"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This seems like a fair price considering its value and your potential profit.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still allows you to save a significant amount compared to its true value to you, and it's fair for me considering my costs.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That allows me to get closer to my budget while still giving you a fair price.",9750.0,Bob,4,
