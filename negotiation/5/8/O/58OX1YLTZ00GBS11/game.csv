"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I have to stay within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $600000 is far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you and shows my willingness to compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $900000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable paying, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
