Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, it's always best to explore maximizing profit.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so we need to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable for us.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Confidence:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we don't have significant time constraints. If we need to sell quickly, accepting John's offer might be the safer choice."
