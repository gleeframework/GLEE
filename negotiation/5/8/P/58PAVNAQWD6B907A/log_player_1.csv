{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) but still lower than what John would pay. It leaves room for negotiation but ensures I get a decent return if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). While I want to make a sale, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's still a great deal for you, considering what it's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $150 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to lose money on it.  John is a guaranteed sale at $150, so I'll choose to sell to him."
