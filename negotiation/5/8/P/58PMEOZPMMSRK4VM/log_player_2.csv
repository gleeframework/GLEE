"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  It's something I'm confident will significantly enhance your operations.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $950,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire something that will generate a strong return on investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer will put pressure on Alice to come down in price."
