Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given your expertise in [Mention Bob's expertise or area of interest], this product could be a game changer.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,150,000. It's a fair price, considering the potential benefits this product offers.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $1,150,000 as the offer price. This is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob has some room for negotiation.  It's more than my guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, but still leaves $50,000 of potential profit for Bob.
* **Message:** The message focuses on the value the product offers to Bob,  using his expertise as a hook.  It emphasizes fairness and invites him to consider the offer without putting pressure on him. 

**Why this approach is good:**

* **Prioritizes Value:** It focuses on the benefits Bob will get, increasing his incentive to buy.
* **Open Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer or negotiate,  keeping the deal open.
* **Fair Price:** $1,150,000  is a good starting point for negotiation,  allowing for a win-win scenario."
