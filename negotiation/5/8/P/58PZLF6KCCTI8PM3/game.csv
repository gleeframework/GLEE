"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to accept $105 for the product? I think this price would be fair to both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I would like to respectfully suggest that we aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to consider your offer, but I would need to adjust my price slightly to $107. This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while offering you a competitive price. I look forward to your consideration.",107.0,Alice,3,
