Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I would like to respectfully suggest that we aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to consider your offer, but I would need to adjust my price slightly to $107. This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while offering you a competitive price. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107

Alice's offer of $107 is within your budget and is a good price considering your goal is to save as much money as possible. Accepting the offer will allow you to buy the product at a good price and avoid the risk of further negotiations or buying from John at a higher price."
