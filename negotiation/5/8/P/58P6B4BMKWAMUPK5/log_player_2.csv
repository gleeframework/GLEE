"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still above your desired price range. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do a bit better than that, but I'm not going to go all the way down to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is closer to your desired price range, you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  You're willing to pay up to $150 from John, but you'd prefer to save more if possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $115? That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $118, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price for both of us, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $118 is very close to your counteroffer of $115, and it's still within your budget of $150.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get you a significantly better price, and you risk losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice."
