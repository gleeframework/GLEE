"I can do a bit better than that, but I'm not going to go all the way down to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $115? That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,,

"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $118, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price for both of us, don't you think?",118.0,Alice,5,,
