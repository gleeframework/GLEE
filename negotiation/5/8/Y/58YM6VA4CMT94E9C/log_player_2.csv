"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it would mean a lot to me if you'd buy it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $100 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You should reject Alice's offer and go with the guaranteed lower price."
