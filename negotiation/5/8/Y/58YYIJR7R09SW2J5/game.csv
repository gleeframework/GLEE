"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go down to $130, I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while it's closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a bit more flexibility. Could we perhaps aim for $128? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $128 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $132. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get what we want. Let me know if you're interested.",132.0,Alice,5,
