"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product. We're excited to discuss the terms of the sale with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After reconsidering our position, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 remains outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe represents a fair compromise. This offer reflects the value I see in your product and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring it."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand that you're trying to find a compromise. However, we're still not willing to go below $1,050,000. We believe this price is more in line with the product's value to you. We're willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is our final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget than previous offers, it's still above his maximum of $800,000. Bob has a few more rounds to negotiate, so it's still worth trying to secure a lower price. There's a possibility Alice might lower her price further to avoid losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you've made a final offer, but $1,025,000 still exceeds my budget. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer a final price of $975,000. This represents a significant concession on my part and a fair compromise considering the value we both see in the product.  I'm confident this offer is mutually beneficial and allows us to complete this transaction."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we understand that you're willing to make a significant concession, but we're still not comfortable accepting an offer below $1,050,000. We're willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,012,500. This is our final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,012,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  There are only three rounds left, and it's unlikely that Alice will lower her price enough for Bob to feel comfortable accepting.  Given the limited time and the risk of further negotiation, Bob is better off purchasing from John at a price that fits his budget."
