"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or consider buying from John."
