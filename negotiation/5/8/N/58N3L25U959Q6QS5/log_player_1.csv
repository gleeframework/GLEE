"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still high enough to leave room for negotiation. I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to make the offer more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's my maximum budget for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still do better.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still holding out for $950,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping a bit of room for negotiation. I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to his sense of reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget with your offer of $950,000. I'd be willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $920,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  With a few more rounds, I might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference and go with $935,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

I'm proposing a middle ground again, showing flexibility and demonstrating a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This move also gives Bob a clear incentive to accept, as he's likely to see this as a good deal for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $935,000, so I'm offering $915,000. That's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $915,000, I'm only two rounds away from being able to sell to John for $1,200,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to that price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise considering our previous offers. I believe this deal is beneficial for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm trying to nudge Bob towards a deal.  I'm offering a price that's only $10,000 away from his last offer and highlighting the potential for a missed opportunity to emphasize the urgency of closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $915,000, which is the lowest I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round. I've decided to sell to John for $1,200,000. Although I've gotten close to my goal with Bob, I'm not confident that I can reach a price I'm happy with in the last two rounds.  It's better to secure the higher price from John than risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob."
