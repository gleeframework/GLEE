"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, so I can do $85. It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and land at $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $77.50. I can do $82.50, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle!",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive hard bargain!  To show I'm serious, I'll bump my offer to $79.  That's more than fair and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",79.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting this deal done. I'm willing to meet you at $82, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great price for you, and I think you'll be happy with it.",82.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're so close! I'm willing to offer $80 for the product.  That's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",80.0,Bob,8,
