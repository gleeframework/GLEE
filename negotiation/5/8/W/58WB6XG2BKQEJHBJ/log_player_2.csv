# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,250. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $10,750. Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is getting close to Bob's desired price point.  Continuing to reject offers risks reaching a point where Alice is no longer willing to negotiate and Bob might have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal for Bob and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
