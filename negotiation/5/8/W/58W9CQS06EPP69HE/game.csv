"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I'm grateful for the reduction, I still feel that $950,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. However, I am willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me while also allowing for a fair transaction.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
