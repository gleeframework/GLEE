Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its value to me while also allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I'm grateful for the reduction, I still feel that $950,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. However, I am willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me while also allowing for a fair transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would like to get even more, $1,025,000 is a good compromise and a significant profit. It's better than risking rejection and having to lower my price further, or selling to John for less."
