"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's unique and has a lot of potential.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($10,000), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Expressing value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob's interest.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  
* **Ten rounds:** I have ten rounds to reach a deal, so rejecting this offer doesn't put me in a desperate position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to be flexible, $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll let it go for $13,500? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on fairness:** Emphasizing ""fair price for both of us"" helps frame the offer as a win-win situation.
* **Specific number:** I'm offering a concrete price rather than a vague counter-offer. This makes it easier for Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12500 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for improvement:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but there's still potential to get closer to my target price.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Continuing to negotiate can potentially lead to a better outcome.
* **Not in a rush:**  With ten rounds, I can afford to be patient and see if I can get a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to continue negotiating, $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm open to moving closer to your offer, but let's meet in the middle at $13,000. This seems like a reasonable compromise given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm showing flexibility by coming closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a higher price point.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify the price.
* **""Reasonable compromise"":** This phrasing emphasizes the fairness of the offer and encourages Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you consider $12750? I think that's a fair compromise given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Limited time:** We're in round 6, and with ten rounds total, there's not much time left to negotiate further. 
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  Even if I reject this offer, I'm not confident that I can get a much higher price from Bob. 
* **John's offer:** While selling to John guarantees $10,000, accepting Bob's offer yields a $2,750 profit. This is a better outcome than selling to John."
