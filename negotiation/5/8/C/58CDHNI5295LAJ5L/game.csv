"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a high-end item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $12000. I'm willing to come down to $18000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still represents a great value for the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $14000 for the product. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet a minimum of $16000 to make this deal worthwhile. Can you consider that?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $16000, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $13500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet a minimum of $16500 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16500 and $13500, so I'll offer it to you for $15000. This is my final concession, and I hope you can consider it.",15000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $15000. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere.",13000.0,Bob,8,
