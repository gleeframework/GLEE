Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I see the potential value, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Let's start with $600,000.  This reflects the significant gap between our valuations and leaves room for further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
