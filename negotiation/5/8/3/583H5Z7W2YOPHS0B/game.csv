"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Could you consider that?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $75 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the price.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $78? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $78 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about we split the difference at $81? That would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.",81.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $79.50. That's the lowest I can go and still feel comfortable with the purchase.",79.5,Bob,6,
