Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Could you consider that?

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to close the deal, $75 is below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $75 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the price."", ""product_price"": 85}

Round 4

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $78 is still below my minimum price, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a higher offer from Bob in the remaining rounds. However, I want to see if I can push for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $78 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about we split the difference at $81? That would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 81}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $79.50. That's the lowest I can go and still feel comfortable with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $79.5 is close to my minimum, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing the deal completely. John is a reliable buyer, and I can guarantee getting $80 by selling to him."
