Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $13,000 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's enough space between your offer and Bob's perceived value for a potential compromise.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and create a starting point for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
