"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's valuation of $8,000 as possible.  Offering $8,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and gives her room to negotiate while still being a better deal than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,700 is closer to Bob's maximum of $10,000, it's still not a great deal. There's still room to negotiate, and Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a price closer to his target of $8,500.  Offering $9,000 is a compromise that demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while also making a significant attempt to lower the price further.  This gives Alice room to agree while still saving Bob money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,600 is now very close to Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob ending up with a worse deal from John outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price within Bob's budget."
