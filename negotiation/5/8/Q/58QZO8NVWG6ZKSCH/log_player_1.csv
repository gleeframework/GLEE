**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's very focused on staying close to his $1,000,000 valuation. At this point, the negotiations are progressing too slowly and the potential gains from continuing with Bob are unlikely to outweigh the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed offer."
