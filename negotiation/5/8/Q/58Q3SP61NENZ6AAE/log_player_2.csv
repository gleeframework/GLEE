Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 just isn't going to work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,400, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's try to reach an agreement in this round! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer of $11,400 is a good deal. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and provides a $600 saving compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and there's a risk that Alice might increase her price in subsequent rounds."
