{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a valuable piece, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is slightly less than my minimum value, it's closer than my previous counteroffer.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale.  There's always a risk that Bob might reject my next counteroffer, and I could end up selling to John for a lower price."
