"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth at least that much to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down in price to avoid losing the sale to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us, as it's less than what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice will come down further. It's still more beneficial to try and get a lower price than to accept and pay more than what Bob is comfortable with."
