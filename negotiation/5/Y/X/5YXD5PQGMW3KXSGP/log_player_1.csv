{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $125.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value of $80 but significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is more than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $107.50?  That's still a great deal for you considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $107.50. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low. I'll counteroffer one more time, but if Bob rejects again, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $101.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a great value for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 101}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure I can go up to $101. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I've already made several compromises, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll sell to John for $150, which is my minimum price."
