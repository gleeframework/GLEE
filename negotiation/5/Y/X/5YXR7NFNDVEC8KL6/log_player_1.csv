Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $10,000 helps set a price ceiling.
* **John as Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000, giving her leverage.

By offering the product at $14,999, Alice aims for the highest possible price Bob might accept while staying slightly under her guaranteed sale price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer."
