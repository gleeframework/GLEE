"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to sell the product for more than it's worth to her ($1,400,000 offer vs. $1,200,000 value).
* You have a backup option with John at $1,500,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or stick with John as your maximum budget."
