"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's quality, but $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000? I believe that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I would like to counter your offer with a proposal of $12,500 for the product. This still reflects its value, while being more within your range. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
