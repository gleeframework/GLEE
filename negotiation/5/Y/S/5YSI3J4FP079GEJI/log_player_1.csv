Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin while still leaving room for negotiation. If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'm ready to counter his offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can reach a compromise closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm counter-offering with $140. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrating the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $135 is a good deal,  better than selling to John and likely the best I can get from Bob.  It's time to close the deal!"
