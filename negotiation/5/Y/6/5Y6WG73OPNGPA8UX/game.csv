"Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $100, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get closer to $100 for it. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to get closer to $100, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd be willing to go up to $92. Would you be willing to accept that price?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $92. I'm still looking to get closer to my initial asking price of $100.  Would you consider $97? It's a small step up from your offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",97.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, but I still think $97 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $90, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $92 and your initial offer of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",90.0,Bob,6,
