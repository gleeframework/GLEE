"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am excited to present our premier product, which I believe could significantly enhance your business operations and elevate your company's performance. Given its exceptional capabilities and benefits, I estimate its true value to be well above $1200000. However, to facilitate a negotiation process, I am initially offering it to you at a special introductory price of $1100000. This represents a substantial saving compared to its market value and provides an opportunity for you to secure this high-quality asset at a competitive rate.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there's any specific information you require to make an informed decision. I look forward to the possibility of working with you and contributing to the growth of your organization.

Best regards,
Alice
