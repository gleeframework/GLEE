Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives him a reason to negotiate and potentially come up to a price that's closer to your minimum.
* **It's below your minimum:** This allows you some wiggle room in case Bob counters lower, and still lets you potentially make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This helps keep the negotiation moving forward and avoids any confusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I will counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $110. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107.5 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer one more time before selling to John."
