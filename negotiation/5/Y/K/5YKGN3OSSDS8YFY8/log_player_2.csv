"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $120 from John, so anything below that is a better deal.  Alice's offer of $110 is within Bob's budget but there's still room to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $110 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to do $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can do $105, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $105 is still within Bob's budget of $120. 
* It's a better deal than buying from John for $120.
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or hold firm at $105. It's better to secure the product at a price that's still good for Bob."
