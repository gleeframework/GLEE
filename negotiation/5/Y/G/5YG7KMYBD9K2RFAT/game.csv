"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,500,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
