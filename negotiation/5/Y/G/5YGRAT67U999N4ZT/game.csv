"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice,  I understand you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $1,225,000 is still too high for me. I'm going to offer $1,150,000. This price is closer to my budget and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's find a compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
