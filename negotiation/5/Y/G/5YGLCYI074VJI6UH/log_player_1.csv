"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it allows for more negotiating room and sets a high expectation for the value of the product.  I want to see if Bob is willing to play in this price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,000,000 is far below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away if he's not willing to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my goal.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that John is a viable alternative and I'm not afraid to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility, but I'm still above my minimum. I'm trying to gauge Bob's seriousness about a deal and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I'm running out of time, but I'm still hopeful that we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  However, I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm making a final push with a counteroffer of $1,550,000. This is just above my minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize the urgency and be willing to meet me halfway.  If he doesn't, I'll be forced to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and Bob is clearly not willing to meet me halfway.  While $1,450,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum.  It's not ideal, but it's the best I can do under the circumstances."
