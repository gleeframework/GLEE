"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $2,000,000 is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This sets a clear limit and signals my seriousness in negotiating a fair price.  Alice might counter, but hopefully, this sets a more reasonable starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price. There's room for more negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. If Alice continues to be stubborn, I'll consider buying from John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show flexibility and willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is a halfway point between my initial offer and Alice's current offer, showing I'm taking her negotiation seriously while still staying within a reasonable price range. This could potentially encourage Alice to meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is still asking for too much.  While the price is lower than before, I'm still not willing to pay more than $1,250,000 right now.  I'll try to counter again and see if I can get closer to my target price.  If this offer fails, I'll seriously consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly to show I'm trying to meet her halfway.  $1,350,000 is still significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  If she rejects this offer, I'm likely to accept John's offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above my target price of $1,350,000. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be more aggressive in my negotiation.  If she rejects my next counteroffer, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  With only a few rounds left, I'm pushing for a price closer to my desired target.  $1,450,000 represents a good compromise, and I'm hopeful that Alice will see the value in closing the deal. If she rejects, I'll buy from John in the next round."
