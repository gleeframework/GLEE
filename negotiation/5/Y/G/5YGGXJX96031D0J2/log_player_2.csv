"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is good, but there's a decent chance we can negotiate an even better price.  Let's see if she's willing to go lower."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. Would you be willing to come down to $500,000?"", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth the investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $550,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While $550,000 is better, let's push a bit further.  There's still room to negotiate before reaching John's price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  $550,000 is getting closer, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be at $525,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 525000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $530,000, which is a small increase from your latest offer. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $530,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle, and $530,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $800,000.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
