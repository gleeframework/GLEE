"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your operations. My initial offer is $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $650,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **I have leverage.** I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to accept a low price. 
* **More negotiation rounds:** I have several rounds left to potentially reach a more favorable price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $650,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  I'm prepared to come down to $900,000.  This price still reflects the product's value, but it leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  How about $725,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $725,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John is a backup:** I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer. 
* **Negotiation continues:**  I have more rounds to try and reach a more favorable price with Bob."

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John is a safe option:**  I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making me less desperate to accept a low offer from Bob.
