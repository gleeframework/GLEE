"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I understand the product's value, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $500,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,400,000? This reflects the worth of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I can do $750,000.  That's a significant offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is increasing his offer, $750,000 is still far below my minimum and what I believe is achievable.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of undervaluing the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, we need to bridge the gap. Let's settle this at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a fair price considering its value."",
""product_price"": 1100000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we need to close this gap.  While I appreciate your final offer, I'm only comfortable going up to $900,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, $900,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. Bob has presented his ""final offer"", signaling he's unlikely to move much higher. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling completely."
