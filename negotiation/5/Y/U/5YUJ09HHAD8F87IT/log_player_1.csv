"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! My price is $100, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and positive message might encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking Bob's opinion, hinting that I'm flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price that works for both of us. 
* **Sell to John is a backup:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John open, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That would be a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to sell for his initial price.
* **Positive language:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and using language that suggests a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Direct question:**  I'm encouraging Bob to respond directly to my offer, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Would you be able to offer the product at $85? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer, $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I have several rounds left, so there's still time to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John is a backup:** Selling to John remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob continue to fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to come down to $95. This is a significant drop from my original offer, but it shows my commitment to reaching a deal with you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting commitment:**  I'm emphasizing that this is a significant drop from my initial offer,  making it seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive but firm:**  The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider the offer, but it's also firm in stating that this is my final offer at this stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. I'm willing to consider $90 as a fair price for the product, given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited time:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiations, and there's no guarantee that Bob will be willing to negotiate further. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:** If I reject this offer, I risk having Bob walk away or refusing to budge further, potentially leaving me with no sale. 
* **John is a backup:**  If this deal falls through, I still have the option of selling to John for $120. 

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer at $90 seems like the most reasonable choice to secure a sale and avoid losing out on a potential profit."
