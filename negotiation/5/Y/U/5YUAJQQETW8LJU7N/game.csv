"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $800,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 to make this work. It's a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects a fair price.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'd like to counteroffer at $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about $600,000? This offer represents a serious commitment from my end and bridges the gap between our valuations.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're making a serious commitment, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $675,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $675,000 is close, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $625,000? I believe this is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $625,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $650,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,7,
