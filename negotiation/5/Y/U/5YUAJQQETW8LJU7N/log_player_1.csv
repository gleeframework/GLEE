Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $800,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 to make this work. It's a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about $600,000? This offer represents a serious commitment from my end and bridges the gap between our valuations.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
