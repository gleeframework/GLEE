Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources and leading to even greater success.  I've priced it at $950,000, reflecting its immense worth.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential value to your endeavors."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a safety net of $800,000 from John, I aim to maximize my profit by offering the product to Bob at a price closer to his perceived value.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $950,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain (his value of $1,000,000 minus the price). This creates a strong incentive for Bob to accept, as he still benefits significantly from the deal.
* **Confidence & Value Highlighting:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price and increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
