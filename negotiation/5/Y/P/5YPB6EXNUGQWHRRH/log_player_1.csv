Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  He won't rationally pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob some room to feel like he's getting a deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,050,000. I believe this represents a fair offer, and I'm open to discussing it further."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,050,000 gives you room to negotiate down while staying above your minimum.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The language suggests flexibility and encourages Bob to counter-offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach.  Depending on your relationship with Bob and your negotiation style, you might choose a more aggressive or conservative opening offer."
