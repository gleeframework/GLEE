"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to maximize my potential profit.  While Bob values the product at $800,000, I know he's interested. This high opening price allows for room to negotiate and still reach a mutually beneficial agreement. It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 at any time, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  However, it's still a price that reflects the value I place on the product. By meeting Bob halfway, I hope to encourage him to accept the offer and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm going to reject this offer and try for a higher price. 

I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point, but if Bob doesn't come up, I'm willing to sell to John at $1,000,000. It's a much better deal than what Bob is offering right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,000,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that Bob understands the value of the product. This is a final offer, and if Bob rejects it, I will immediately sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I'm disappointed that I wasn't able to reach a deal with Bob, I am not willing to go lower than $1,000,000. 

John is offering a fair price that meets my minimum requirements, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale. It's important to remember that I value the product at over $1,000,000, and I'm happy with this outcome."
