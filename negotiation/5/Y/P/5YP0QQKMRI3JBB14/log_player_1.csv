Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's a significant amount above my minimum acceptable price ($80), but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for a back and forth, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement closer to the $120 value Bob sees.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage and helps build a positive relationship. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $80 serves as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fall through, I have a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a little steep for me, though.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it still indicates he's interested. I can counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer as a fallback:**  I can always sell to John for $80 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to counteroffer. $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  Would you be interested in $85?  That would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $85 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that he gets a good deal at $85, emphasizing the benefit for him.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and open tone, encouraging further negotiation. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  I still have John's $80 offer as a backup, so I can afford to be a little flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a price closer to what you need, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.
* **No further gains:**  While I could counteroffer, it's unlikely Bob will budge further, and I risk losing the sale altogether.
* **John's offer is the same:** John is offering the same price, so there's no advantage in selling to him. 
* **Finalizing the deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I sell the product at the minimum price I'm willing to accept."
