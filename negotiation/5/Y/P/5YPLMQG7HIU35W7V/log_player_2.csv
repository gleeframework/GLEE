Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1200000 is a good starting point, it's still below the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can't refuse given the potential this product holds. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.

Alice has lowered her price but it's still higher than what John is offering. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
