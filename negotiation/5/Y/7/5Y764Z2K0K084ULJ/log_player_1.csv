{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being attractive to Bob.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer again, but I'll keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you consider $10,500?  It's a good compromise and allows us both to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low for me. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as I negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair compromise.  This price still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}
