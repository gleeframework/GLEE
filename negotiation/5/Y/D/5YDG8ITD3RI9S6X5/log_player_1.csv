{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've expressed interest in.  I'm asking $175 for it.  It's a great deal for a product of this quality.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know John would pay, knowing Bob might be willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $175 leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without me immediately feeling like I need to sell to John.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  I have room to negotiate and increase the price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If I can't reach an agreement with Bob, I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of my own profit.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $115?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for One More Counteroffer:** I can make a final counteroffer closer to Bob's price, hoping to secure a deal without going too low.
* **John Remains a Backup:** If the negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to go a bit lower.  How about $120?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is my final counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions.
* **Close to Bob's Offer:** $120 is only $5 above Bob's last offer, increasing the chances of acceptance.
* **Positive and Motivating:** The message is upbeat, expressing my willingness to reach an agreement. 
* **Last Chance:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell the product to John for $150."
