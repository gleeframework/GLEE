"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11,250. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $11,250 is closer, I'm still a bit above my budget.  Let's split the difference and try $11,125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11125.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500, as I mentioned in our first offer. I'm willing to meet you at $11,375, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again.  $11,375 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $11,250, as a final offer. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go back to $11,250. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I'm not budging from there. I'm starting to think we might be too far apart. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
