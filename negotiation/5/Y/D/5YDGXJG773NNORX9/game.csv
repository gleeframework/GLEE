"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $950,000, which is a fair and reasonable offer given its value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price, closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000.  Would that price point be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiation. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I think $810,000 is the lowest I can go. This is a fair price that balances both our interests.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. Let's make this simple: $780,000. That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer the product to you for $820,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",820000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting very close to John's price. I'm willing to offer $790,000 as my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I will have to go with John.",790000.0,Bob,8,
