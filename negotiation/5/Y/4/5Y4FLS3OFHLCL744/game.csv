"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's close this deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go down to $109 for this product.  This is my final offer, and I think it's fair to both of us.  Let's make this happen!",109.0,Alice,5,
