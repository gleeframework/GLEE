"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $160 is better than my minimum of $150, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $180. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, giving him some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I initially hoped for a higher price, $170 is still a good profit and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing out on a sale."
