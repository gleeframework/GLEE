Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're struggling to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to make a significant move to bridge the gap, but only if you're serious about purchasing. If you can increase your offer to $1,200,000, we have a deal.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.
