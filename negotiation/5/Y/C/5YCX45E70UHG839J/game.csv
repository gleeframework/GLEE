"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the significant returns you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the product's worth and the value it will bring you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $800,000. It's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let's make a deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're struggling to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to make a significant move to bridge the gap, but only if you're serious about purchasing. If you can increase your offer to $1,200,000, we have a deal.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another interested buyer, but $1,200,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This demonstrates my seriousness about buying the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
