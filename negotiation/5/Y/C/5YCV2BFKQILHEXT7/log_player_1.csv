Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially achieving a good profit.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and positive in my message, highlighting the potential value for Bob. This approach aims to build rapport and encourage him to consider my offer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:** By offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, I create room for negotiation.
* **Be flexible:**  I'm prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial offer.
* **Maintain a safety net:**  The option to sell to John for $15,000 ensures I won't settle for a price below my minimum. 

I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 and even below my initial offer of $12,000. While selling to John for $15,000 is an option, I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob just yet. I believe there's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range. I'll need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to lower my price while still remaining above my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $10,000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would allow me to make a profit while still being within your budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Empathy:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints, which further shows good faith and makes my offer more appealing.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a clear reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the potential benefits for both of us.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintaining Value:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum value of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This tactic encourages a sense of fairness and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Building Rapport:**  Continuing to be friendly and understanding can help to build trust and facilitate a successful negotiation.

I'll continue to adjust my strategy depending on Bob's next move."
