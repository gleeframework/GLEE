"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for your product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's continue this negotiation and find a mutually beneficial solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $825,000.  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to close this transaction.",825000.0,Bob,4,
