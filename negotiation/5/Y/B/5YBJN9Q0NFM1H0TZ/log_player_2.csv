"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth $800,000 to you, and she's asking for $900,000.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for your product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's continue this negotiation and find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your target price, but $850,000 is still more than what you're willing to pay.  You can likely negotiate further to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $825,000.  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 825000}
