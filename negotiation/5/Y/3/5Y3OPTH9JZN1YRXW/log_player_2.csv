"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows me to earn a respectable profit.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency and make you think you'll miss out if you don't accept her offer. 
* You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to her and you have a backup option with John at $1,500,000. 
* By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price, closer to its actual value to Alice. 

**It's important to note:** There's a risk Alice will sell to the other buyer. However, the potential savings from a counter-offer outweigh the risk of losing the deal in this scenario."
