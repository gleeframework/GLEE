Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of your product, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I am willing to pay $850000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $925,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm hoping to get at least $900,000 and I still have 6 rounds to work with."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I would like to suggest $880000 as a counterproposal. This allows us to stay within my budget while still valuing the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's counteroffer of $880,000 is tempting, I'm concerned that we're getting close to the end of the rounds and I might not be able to get any closer to my target price. It's important to secure a sale and ensure I get a decent profit.  John's offer of $800,000 is a good deal and a safe option, especially with only 4 rounds remaining."
