"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's estimated value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me some room to lower the price in future rounds.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm hinting at the value of the product to Bob, implying that even at this price, he's getting a good deal. 

**Strategy:**

* This is a starting point. I'll analyze Bob's response to adjust my strategy for the next round. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to counter with a lower price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is lower than my starting price but still higher than his estimated value, which suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I believe I can still achieve a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Potential for Compromise:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might be closer to his preferred price, leading to a deal.

**Strategy:**

* I will make a counteroffer in the next round. I will aim for a price closer to $1,400,000, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While it's closer to my initial asking price, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to drop to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and its potential for you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and potential benefits, subtly reinforcing the attractiveness of this deal.
* **Reasonable Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is still above Bob's estimated value, giving him some room to negotiate while remaining profitable for me.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a quick resolution by presenting a reasonable compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to re-evaluate whether to continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,320,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,350,000.
* **Potential for Compromise:** There is still room for negotiation, and I believe I can potentially secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I want to exhaust all options with Bob first. The potential for a higher price with Bob outweighs the guaranteed but slightly lower price from John.

**Strategy:**

* I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price slightly higher than Bob's current offer. This will demonstrate my commitment to negotiation while still maintaining a profitable outcome for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once again and come down to $1,330,000.  This price is fair considering the product's value and allows for both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1330000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's current offer. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the ""mutually beneficial outcome"" to encourage Bob to see the value in accepting.
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is just slightly above Bob's estimated value, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. This might be the final push needed to secure the deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

*  If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John.  However, I want to see if I can get just a bit closer to my desired price before making that decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,310,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm getting close to my target, and I hope we can meet in the middle soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,310,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,310,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,330,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We are getting close to a negotiation stalemate, and there is a high chance Bob will not increase his offer further.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer and closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

* Although I've been persistent in negotiating with Bob, the risk of not reaching a mutually acceptable price is increasing. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
