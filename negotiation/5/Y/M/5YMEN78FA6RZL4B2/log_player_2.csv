Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. I'm not sure how much longer I'm willing to negotiate, though. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
