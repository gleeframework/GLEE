"I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $14,000, which is a significant step closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. I'm not sure how much longer I'm willing to negotiate, though.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $15,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,500, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close this deal.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $15,000, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, but I need to know you're serious about buying the product. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",15000.0,Alice,7,
