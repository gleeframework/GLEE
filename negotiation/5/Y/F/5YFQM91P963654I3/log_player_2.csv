"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a fair price, given its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best possible price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a lower price while still being within his budget. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price but leaving room for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob's maximum price is $150.
* **Current Offer:** Alice is offering $135.
* **Potential Savings:** While Bob could potentially negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go lower than $130, and there's a risk of her rejecting further counteroffers. 
* **Time Factor:**  Each round takes time, and Bob has a limited number of rounds.

Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product at a price that's within his budget and saves him $15 compared to buying from John. There's a good chance Bob could get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, but the risk of a deal breaking down or running out of rounds outweighs the potential for further savings."
