Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $107.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can reach a deal at $105. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really excited to get this product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $106.25. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has made a significant concession, and while $106.25 is a bit higher than my initial target, it's still within my budget and a good deal considering the product's value to me.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
