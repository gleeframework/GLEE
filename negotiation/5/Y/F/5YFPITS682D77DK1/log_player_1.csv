"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range. I'm running out of time, so I need to be firm in my negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and it's the closest I can go to your price. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,550,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but I'm not going any higher. Can you reconsider your final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where negotiations with Bob are no longer productive.  My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000, and Bob is unwilling to go that high.  Therefore, I will accept the offer from John, which is my minimum acceptable price."
