"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a counter-offer negotiation, potentially driving the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his $10,000 limit. This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to negotiate.  It's a reasonable starting point for the counter-offer phase."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial $7,500, it's still above Bob's target price of $10,000. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price. He still has 7 rounds left to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price point. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to meet halfway. If accepted, it would save Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John. However, there's still room for negotiation, so Bob shouldn't be afraid to continue if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is now within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While it's not the absolute lowest possible price, Bob has been negotiating for a while and it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. Accepting at this point ensures a deal, and Bob saves $1,500."
