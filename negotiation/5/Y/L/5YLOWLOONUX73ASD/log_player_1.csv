Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I know it's of great value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.  To make this simple, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I need to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit above my minimum. 
* **Respectful Approach:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing mutual benefit and leaving Bob open to counter-offering. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** I don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value of $1,200,000. My offer needs to strike a balance between being ambitious and realistic.
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer sets the stage for potential negotiation. I'm prepared to adjust my price slightly if needed, but I won't go below $1,200,000 knowing John is a guaranteed buyer."
