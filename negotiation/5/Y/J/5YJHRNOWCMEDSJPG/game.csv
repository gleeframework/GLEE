"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,250,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me a bit more than my minimum. However, if you decline, I have another buyer lined up at the $1,200,000 mark. Your decision ultimately determines the outcome.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
