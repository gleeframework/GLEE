"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,250,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me a bit more than my minimum. However, if you decline, I have another buyer lined up at the $1,200,000 mark. Your decision ultimately determines the outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is bluffing. She knows you have an alternative buyer (John) willing to pay $1,200,000.  It's unlikely she'd risk losing the sale by sticking to a higher price. 
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to overpay. She'll likely come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale to John."
