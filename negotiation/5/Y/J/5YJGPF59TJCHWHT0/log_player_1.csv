"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $170. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a good price while also giving Bob some room to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $160. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and hopefully will lead to a quicker resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $145 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll reject the offer and see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price.  I have John as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $155. This is closer to my minimum acceptable price and also closer to Bob's last offer. Hopefully, this will convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher offer from Bob, and I risk losing the sale altogether.  Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'd rather close the deal with Bob if possible.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale at my minimum price."
