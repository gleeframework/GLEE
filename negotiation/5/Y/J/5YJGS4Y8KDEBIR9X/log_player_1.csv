Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $140 is more than $120, which is what Bob believes the product is worth. This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $140 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This price allows for some back-and-forth before you potentially need to turn to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  It's important to remember that I have a backup option with John, so I can afford to be firm in my negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $132.50?  That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Fairness:**  The price is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting a fair solution.
* **Direct language:**  The message is clear and avoids any unnecessary fluff."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $125, so how about we settle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal, and I don't want to settle for less than I think the product is worth.  If this counteroffer fails, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $130 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about $135?  That's only a small step up from your offer, and it would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Push:** This is likely my last attempt to get a better price from Bob before I go with John.
* **Small Increment:**  A small increase from his last offer ($130 to $135) shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Closing Statement:**  The message emphasizes reaching a deal, encouraging Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I've got a limit of $128. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $128 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've made several counteroffers and have reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $150.  This ensures that I get a fair price and avoid further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
