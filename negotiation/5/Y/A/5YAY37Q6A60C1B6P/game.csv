"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a discounted rate. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given my budget constraints and the value I expect from the product. I look forward to your response.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $100. I've already invested a significant amount of time and effort into this product, and I believe it's worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $105. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a discounted rate. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
