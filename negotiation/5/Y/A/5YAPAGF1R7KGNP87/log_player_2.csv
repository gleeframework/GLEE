"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is less than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to the product's value to him as possible. Offering $125 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation but also demonstrating Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still above Bob's desired price, but it's getting closer to his limit.  At this point, Bob should consider the potential risk of continuing to negotiate. There's a chance Alice could refuse to budge further, forcing Bob to either buy from John at a higher price or walk away empty-handed. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's within Bob's budget and avoids potential loss."
