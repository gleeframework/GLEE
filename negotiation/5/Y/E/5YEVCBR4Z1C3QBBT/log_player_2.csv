"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice since you can get the product for less from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $9,500 is a little low for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $12,000 and still higher than Alice's desired price of $8,000. This allows both parties to get a good outcome."
