"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to get a fair price and you to acquire a valuable product.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
