"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still very confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1225000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer a counteroffer of $1210000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.
