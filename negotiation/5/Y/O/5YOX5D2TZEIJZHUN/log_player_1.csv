Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) allows you to maximize your profit.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting slightly lower than Bob's valuation leaves room for potential negotiation if needed. 
* **Backup Option:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so you're not desperate and can confidently aim higher with Bob."
