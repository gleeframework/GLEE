"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,150,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to lower the price to $1,250,000. This still represents a strong value for you, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still slightly over my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, my maximum. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's your desired value for the product. Let's finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
