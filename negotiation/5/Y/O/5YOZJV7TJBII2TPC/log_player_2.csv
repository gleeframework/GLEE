"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a steal, considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have the option to buy the product from John for $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while also establishing a lower price point.  This approach aims to put pressure on Alice to lower her price without completely closing the door to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $75 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than your maximum budget of $100. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get her closer to your desired price point. Rejecting her offer will allow you to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $80.  I really want this product, but my budget is tight. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that you're willing to compromise but are still pushing for a better price.  A $5 increase from your previous offer demonstrates a commitment to negotiating while keeping the offer within your budget. It's a small step towards Alice's price, but it keeps the negotiation moving forward."
