Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, reflecting its value and my financial limitations.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a fair reflection of the product's value and my budget. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""

``` 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he will reach my minimum of $800,000 in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
