Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $14,000 is a good starting point. It's closer to my minimum value of $15,000 than Bob's value of $12,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth accepting or if I should counter. 
* If negotiations stall, I'll move on to John, who is guaranteed to buy at my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value.**  While it's closer than his previous offer, it's still not profitable enough for me. 
* **I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000.**  This gives me a strong fallback position.
* **I can still negotiate with Bob.**  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but higher than his current offer. This will keep the negotiation moving while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the compromise.
* **Reasonable Price:** $13,500 is still above my minimum value of $15,000, so it's a good deal for me.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale at a reasonable price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to assess the situation carefully. If his counteroffer is still significantly below my minimum value, I'll sell to John. However, if it's close, I'll consider negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,500, but I'm still a little over budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to get the product within my price range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum value:** $13,000 is only $2,000 below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Potential for future business:**  Accepting Bob's offer could lead to future sales or partnerships. 
* **Risk of losing John:**  While John is a guaranteed buyer, there's always the possibility of a delay or unforeseen issues with the sale.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal. This ensures a successful sale with a potential for future collaborations with Bob."
