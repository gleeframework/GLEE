"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value for your specific needs and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  However, $1,000,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,180,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1180000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,180,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
