"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value for your specific needs and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), I leave room for negotiation while aiming for a maximized profit.
* **Gauge Bob's Reaction:** This first offer allows me to understand Bob's negotiation style and how serious he is about the purchase.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 gives me leverage. I won't settle for anything less,  allowing me to confidently negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is better than my fallback option of selling to John, but it's still significantly lower than my initial ask.  Rejecting this offer signals that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a substantial loss. By rejecting, I aim to encourage Bob to move closer to a price point that's more mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  However, $1,000,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,180,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 1180000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting a price almost exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a strong profit margin.
* **Justification:** Tying the price to ""the product's worth"" subtly reinforces the idea that my initial valuation was fair.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  Continuing the negotiation keeps Bob engaged and potentially prevents him from walking away prematurely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,180,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,100,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, demonstrating a genuine interest in the product. Accepting now capitalizes on that momentum and avoids the risk of him walking away. 
* **Time Value:** Prolonging negotiations further might not yield significantly better results and comes with the opportunity cost of potentially missing other deals.  Closing the deal now secures a substantial profit."
