"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value for your specific needs and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than her value of $800,000. There is plenty of room for negotiation. It's better to reject and attempt to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  However, $1,000,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,180,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,180,000 is still higher than my desired price point. While it's closer, I can likely still negotiate a better price. I'll reject and try to get closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,180,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
