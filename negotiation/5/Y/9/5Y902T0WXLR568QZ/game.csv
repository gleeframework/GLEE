"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value. However, the product's value to me is quite high, and $8,000 wouldn't be justifiable.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $8,750 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do even better than that. How about $8,250?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems like we both see the value in this product.  While I'm aiming a bit higher, I can be flexible. How about $8,500? That's a strong offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal work.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,375?",8375.0,Bob,6,
