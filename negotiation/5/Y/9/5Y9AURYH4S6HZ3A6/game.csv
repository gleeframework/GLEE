"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my desired price.  I'm still a bit too high at $850,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
