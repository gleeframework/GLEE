# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $7,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product!

Alice seems stuck at $7,500 and is unlikely to budge.  It's not worth risking a worse deal by continuing the negotiation with her. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is better than Alice's current offer."
