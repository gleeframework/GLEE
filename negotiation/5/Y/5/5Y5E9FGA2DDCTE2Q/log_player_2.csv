Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for this product. Let's find some common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1,100,000 is still not enough for me. I'm firm on my last offer of $1,125,000.  It's a fair price for a valuable product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue to negotiate, Alice seems firm on her price of $1,125,000.  It's possible we could get her down a little more, but there's a risk she won't budge, and we'll end up with a worse deal or having to go with John at the full $1,200,000. Accepting now secures a reasonable discount and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity."
