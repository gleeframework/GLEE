"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $775,000? This would still leave a good amount of value for you, and would allow me to make a reasonable profit.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That price is closer, but I'm aiming for something more in the $750,000 range. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and $750,000 is getting closer to where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $762,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",762500.0,Alice,5,
