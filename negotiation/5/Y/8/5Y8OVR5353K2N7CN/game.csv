"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",13000.0,Alice,7,
