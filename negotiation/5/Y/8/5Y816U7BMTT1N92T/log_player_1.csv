"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point while also showing that I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $9,000, it's far below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident you'll agree this is a good value for a product that's worth so much to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer again and see if we can reach a more agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,200, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I'm starting to think we might not be able to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
