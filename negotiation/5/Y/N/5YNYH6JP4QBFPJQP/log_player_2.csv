While $1,000,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're comfortable with. Continue negotiating and see if you can get Alice to come down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you have a budget constraint, but $900000 is still below the value I'm aiming for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know if this works for you.

Alice is coming down, but $950,000 is still above your budget.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $800,000, it's best to take that option and avoid further negotiation."
