"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $145 is less than $150.
* **You're getting a deal:** The product is worth $150 to you, and you're getting it for $145.
* **Even though Alice values it at $100, her offer is still within your range.**"
