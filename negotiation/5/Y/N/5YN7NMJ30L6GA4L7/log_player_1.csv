Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation above your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves a small buffer for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring you get more than your $10,000 minimum.
* **Create Urgency:** Highlighting that you'll offer it elsewhere creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification (optional):** You could add a line about why you believe it's worth this price to Bob, enhancing the perceived value."
