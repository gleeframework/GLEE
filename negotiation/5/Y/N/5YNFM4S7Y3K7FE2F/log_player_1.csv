"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still high enough to be profitable. This leaves room for negotiation and encourages Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'd love to make a quick sale, $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering your position and the value of the product, I would like to propose $12,500 as a compromise. This brings us closer to my budget while still acknowledging the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with selling it for under $13,000. There are still rounds left, and I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $13,500. It's a fair price that reflects the value of my product and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. I'm willing to increase my offer to $13,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is just below my desired price, but it's still within my acceptable range and a decent profit. There are only a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. It's time to close the sale."
