"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly a game-changer in its category. Given its exceptional quality and unique features, we believe it's worth more than $80. Considering this, I'd like to extend you an exclusive offer to purchase it at $120. This price reflects not only its intrinsic value but also the opportunity for you to benefit from its superior performance. I'm confident it will meet and exceed your expectations. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price point.  Since you can get the same product from John for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere."
