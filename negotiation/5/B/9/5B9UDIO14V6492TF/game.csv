"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I see its value, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,175,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for this product.  It's a fair price, considering the value it offers, and it's the highest I can go right now.  I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
