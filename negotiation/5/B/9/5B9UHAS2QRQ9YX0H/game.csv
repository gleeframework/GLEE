"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $850,000. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value you'll get from it.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $875,000. This is the minimum price I'm comfortable with considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $875,000. This is my final offer.",875000.0,Alice,5,
