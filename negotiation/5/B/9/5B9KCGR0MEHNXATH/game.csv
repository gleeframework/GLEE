"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique nature of the product, $1800000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1400000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1600000 is getting closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'll increase my offer to $1500000, which is my absolute top limit.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $1700000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
