Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that you're offering it to Bob before listing it publicly, you create a sense of exclusivity and imply that the price might increase later.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his willingness to pay. If he outright rejects it, you can always negotiate down, knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
