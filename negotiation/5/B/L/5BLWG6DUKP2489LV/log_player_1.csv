Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your endeavors.  I'm asking for $950,000, reflecting its true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower than that with Bob might secure a quicker sale and still yield a significant profit.
* **High Value Perception:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, justifying the high price.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. This strategy allows Alice to potentially secure a price closer to her ideal outcome while still exceeding John's offer."
