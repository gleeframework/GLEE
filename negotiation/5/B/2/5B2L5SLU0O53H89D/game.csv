"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $17500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",17500.0,Alice,3,
