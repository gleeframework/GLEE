**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($14,000 vs. $12,000).** This suggests there might be room for negotiation.
* **You have a backup option with John at $15,000.** This gives you leverage to reject Alice's offer and potentially get a better price. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate with her or potentially find another seller with a lower price.**"
