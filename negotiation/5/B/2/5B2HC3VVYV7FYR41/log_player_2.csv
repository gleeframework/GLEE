"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less than $9,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still think the product is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8800. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $8,800, which is still below his $10,000 limit.  It's a good deal for Bob, and he's unlikely to get a lower price from Alice."
