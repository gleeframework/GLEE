"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm confident in the value of my product, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work.  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's fair to me.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I would prefer a higher price, I'm getting closer to a deal, and the risk of further negotiation could lead to a lower offer from Bob or losing him altogether.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most pragmatic choice to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of selling to John for a lower price."
