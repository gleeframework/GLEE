,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $160 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $130 for it.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $160 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $145.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $145 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about $135? That's a fair price for us both.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $140 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to take $138? It's just a couple of dollars more than my last offer, and I really want this product.",138.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $138 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'd be willing to meet you at $142, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.",142.0,Alice,7,
