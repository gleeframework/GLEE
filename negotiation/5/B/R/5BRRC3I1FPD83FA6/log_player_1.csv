Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this, I can still get my minimum from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand you're working within a budget, but $85 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$90 is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm not sure how much more I can push Bob, and I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, he might walk away altogether.  I'll accept this offer and be happy to have made a sale, even if it's not my ideal price."
