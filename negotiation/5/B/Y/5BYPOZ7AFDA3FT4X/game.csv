"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9000.0,Alice,5,
