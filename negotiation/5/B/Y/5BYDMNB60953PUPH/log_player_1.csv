Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to potentially earn more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above my minimum. 
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the ""value"" of the product might make Bob more amenable to a higher price."
