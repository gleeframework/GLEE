"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is above his budget and he can get the product for $12,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob should start by making a significant counteroffer.  $10,000 is a bold move, but it shows Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal. This also gives him room to negotiate upwards if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He's already established that he's willing to walk away, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

Bob should increase his counteroffer to $11,000. This is a more reasonable compromise and shows Alice that he is willing to move towards her price, but still wants a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,500 is getting closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He's already established that he's willing to walk away, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. He could potentially get a better deal by continuing to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

Bob should increase his counteroffer to $12,500. This is a small increment, showing Alice he's serious about closing the deal. He's almost at his limit, but there's still room to negotiate a slightly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,000 is tempting, he's already established that he's willing to walk away and buy from John for $12,000.  With only a few rounds left, there's still a chance he could get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
```

Bob should increase his counteroffer to $12,750. This is a small increment, showing Alice he's serious about closing the deal. He's almost at his limit, but there's still room to negotiate a slightly lower price. With only two rounds left, he needs to make a strong move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose option (3) and buy the product from John for $12,000.  

Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** There's only one round left, and Alice is unlikely to budge significantly lower.
* **Small price difference:**  $12,800 is very close to his limit, and the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal.
* **John is a sure bet:** John is guaranteed to sell the product at his stated price, eliminating the risk of further negotiation and potential failure.

By buying from John, Bob ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the uncertainty of a final round of negotiation with Alice."
