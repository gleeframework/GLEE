"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $1,100,000 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,075,000. I really need to stay within my budget, but I'm interested in making a deal with you.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit away from your offer. How about $1,090,000? This is a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,090,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but I'd like to get closer to that price. How about $1,080,000? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal here.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
