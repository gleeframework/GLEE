Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's potential interest in the product. This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than $80 from John, it's still far below the product's value to Bob ($150).  It's worth trying to get closer to that value by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$105 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement over John's offer of $80, and it's likely the best we can get from Bob.  Accepting his offer brings us closer to our goal of maximizing profit."
