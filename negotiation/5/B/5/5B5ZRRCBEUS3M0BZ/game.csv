"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,200. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",13200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However,  $13,200 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could we settle at $12,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",12800.0,Alice,5,
