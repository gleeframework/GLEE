"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay a maximum of $80, and Alice is asking for $110. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum price of $80. This is a firm offer, as I'm willing to walk away and buy from John if Alice won't budge. This strategy aims to get Alice to accept quickly or signal a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to my limit, it's still above my maximum price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, aiming for a lower price, as I still have rounds left and can always buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $85. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. However, I'm staying below my maximum price and keeping the pressure on Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my target, I'm still willing to push for a lower price. It's important to remember that I have the safety net of buying from John for $80. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $87. This signals a willingness to compromise while staying within my budget. I'm hoping this offer is tempting enough for Alice to accept, but I'm still prepared to walk away if she refuses."
