Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's value (even if vague) can make the price seem more justified.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation.
* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome. 
* If negotiations stall, I'll switch to John to ensure I at least get my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Even though Bob has rejected my initial offer, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as a buyer for $150 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $150. I might use a strategy like a slight decrease from my initial offer to make it seem like I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by decreasing my price from $175 to $140. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value by stating it's still a good deal for him.
* **Focus on Profit:**  I subtly mention my need for a fair profit, suggesting that $140 is the lowest I can go.

**Next Steps:**

*  If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider John's offer or potentially make another counteroffer, depending on how determined Bob seems."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $110 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiations are stalling:**  Bob's consistent lowball offers suggest he's unlikely to budge much further. 
* **John's offer is a safe option:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees I'll get my minimum price and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll contact John and complete the sale to secure a guaranteed profit."
