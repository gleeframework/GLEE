"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $750,000? I believe it's a fair offer considering my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of offering the product for $850,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to settle at $825,000? That's the highest I can go.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've already made a significant concession by offering the product for $850,000, and now you're asking me to go even lower to $825,000. I'm starting to think that we're not on the same page. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me in the middle. I'll offer the product for $875,000. This is my final concession, and I expect you to meet me at this price or walk away.",875000.0,Alice,7,
