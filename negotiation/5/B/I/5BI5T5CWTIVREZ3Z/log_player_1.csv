Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $15,000 gives room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing my minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, knowing I have a safety net with John's offer."
