"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider a compromise, though. I can offer you the product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer you the product for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to budge a little more, but $10,500 is still pushing my limit. How about $9,750?  That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to budge a bit more, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $9,750. I can offer you the product for $10,250. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this deal. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely in the ballpark now.  I can tell we're both motivated to make a deal.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $9,900. I believe that's a very competitive offer, and I'm hoping we can close this out.",9900.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I can offer you the product for $9,950. It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to get a deal done. What do you think?",9950.0,Alice,9,
