# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's in my best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still higher than my maximum budget. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try to get a better price, as John's offer remains a safe fallback option."
