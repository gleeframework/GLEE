Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer allows me to earn a significant amount of money ($900,000) while still being lower than what the product is worth to me ($1,000,000). It is also higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($800,000), making it a potentially appealing offer for him. This strategy balances the potential for a higher profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If he does reject, I can still sell the product to John for $1,000,000, ensuring a decent profit."
