"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000, you can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice. You know the product is worth $800,000 to her, so there's room for a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $850,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $900,000. This price is still above Alice's minimum value of $800,000,  making it a potentially acceptable compromise. By offering a lower price, I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate and hopefully pushing Alice towards a deal that saves me money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is still within my budget, it's not a good deal. It's higher than my initial counteroffer of $850,000, and there's still room for negotiation.  I believe I can still push for a lower price, especially since Alice has already rejected my counteroffer.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $875,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  However, it's still a significant discount from Alice's latest offer of $950,000.  This counteroffer should hopefully push Alice towards a more favorable price for me while still leaving room for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is getting increasingly closer to my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to negotiate much lower than that. Rather than risking further negotiation rounds that might not yield a better price, it's more efficient and less risky to buy from John for $1,500,000.  I'm guaranteed to get the product and avoid the potential for further delays or failed negotiations."
