Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
