Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but I believe it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob is interested. I'm also confident I can sell to John for $100 if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that yet.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but it's still above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge from his $100 offer.  At this point, I've already spent a few rounds trying to negotiate a better price, and it's becoming clear that I won't get more than $100.  To avoid further negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100."
