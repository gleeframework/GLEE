Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. It's above my minimum of $80, but leaves room for Bob to potentially counteroffer if he feels it's too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's higher than John's offer of $80, it's still below my desired price point and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $105. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $120 and his offer of $90. It still leaves room for further negotiation, but hopefully, it's a price that Bob is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $95.  While I would have preferred a higher price, it's a good deal for me considering the value to Bob and it's higher than John's offer. It's time to close the deal and maximize my earnings."
