"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,500,000. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident this is a fair price. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price of $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and frames the price as ""fair,"" aiming to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message clearly indicates I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts, implying a willingness to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be subjective, but based on my research and needs, I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While Bob's offer meets my minimum acceptable value, it's still quite low, leaving little room for profit. 
* **Negotiation is key:**  I believe I can potentially secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation process.  
* **Time to counteroffer:**  I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe the value of this product justifies a slightly higher price.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $1,350,000.  This leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Middle ground:** My counteroffer of $1,350,000 is exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a reasonable profit.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its potential worth.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing that the proposed price is fair and beneficial for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget and the value I perceive in the product, I would like to propose a price of $1300000. I hope this aligns better with our negotiation goals. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my desired outcome and is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Limited time:** We are already in round 4, and I'm aware that we have a limited number of rounds to reach an agreement. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:** Rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer, and potentially needing to sell to John for a lower price.  
* **Reasonable compromise:**  This is a fair compromise, allowing me to secure a good price for the product while also moving forward with the sale."
