"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable item for a special price. I believe it's a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is being a bit cheeky by mentioning your maximum valuation, $900,000 is a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer nets you a $300,000 discount."
