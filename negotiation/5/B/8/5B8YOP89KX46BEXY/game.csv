"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity with a potential for significant return. I'm asking for $2000000, which reflects its value and the market demand. Let me know your thoughts!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $2000000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which is my maximum for this purchase. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1700000, which reflects a fair compromise. This price still allows for a good return for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still too high for me. My budget is capped at $800000, and I'm not willing to go beyond that.  If you're serious about making a deal, I'm ready to close it at that price. Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.",800000.0,Bob,4,
