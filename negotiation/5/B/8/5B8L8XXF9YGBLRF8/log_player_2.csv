Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While $5,000 is a bit too low for me, I want to see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This product really is worth more than that, but I'm trying to be flexible. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is still too low for me. This product is truly unique and offers significant value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? I'm willing to make this final compromise to close the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

At this point, Alice's offer matches the price offered by John. It makes sense to accept Alice's offer now, as further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price."
