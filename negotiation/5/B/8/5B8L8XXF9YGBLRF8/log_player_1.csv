{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'd find very useful.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging to build rapport and avoid immediate rejection. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I subtly highlight the product's potential usefulness to Bob, reminding him of its value.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adapt my strategy. If he rejects, I'll consider:

* **Lowering Slightly:**  I might reduce the price by a smaller amount (e.g., to $11,500) to show flexibility. 
* **Exploring His Needs:**  I might ask Bob what he'd be willing to pay to understand his limitations better.
* **Walking Away:**  If his counteroffers are too low or I feel the negotiation is going nowhere, I'll  terminate the negotiation and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too high for me right now.  How about $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $5,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even lower than my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows that he's interested and open to negotiation.  I can try to bridge the gap and reach a more reasonable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, perhaps around $9,000 - $10,000.  I'll explain why my product is worth more and try to highlight its value to Bob. 
* **Watch for Signals:**  I'll closely observe Bob's responses to gauge his willingness to negotiate and his budget constraints.
* **Prepare to Walk Away:**  If Bob continues to offer prices significantly lower than my minimum, I'll sell to John for $15,000 to avoid further loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While $5,000 is a bit too low for me, I want to see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This product really is worth more than that, but I'm trying to be flexible. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  I'm offering $9,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility without sacrificing too much of my profit.
* **Highlighting value:**  I subtly remind Bob of the product's value by mentioning that it's ""really worth more than that.""
* **Encouraging further negotiation:**  I phrase my offer as a question (""What do you think?"") to open the door for further discussion and potential compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he's still too low, I'll consider lowering my price slightly more.
* **Prepare for a possible impasse:** If Bob refuses to budge from his $5,000 offer, I'll be ready to walk away and sell to John.
* **Explore other options:** If the negotiation stalls, I might try to understand Bob's budget constraints better and explore alternative payment options or deals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I have a strict budget. Could we settle at $7,000? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $7,000 is closer to my desired price than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I am not willing to sell the product at such a significant loss.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Bob's persistent offers indicate that he is interested in the product and willing to negotiate. There is still potential to reach a more favorable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make another counteroffer, likely around $8,000-$8,500, to try and close the gap. I'll emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate.
* **Explore alternative solutions:**  If Bob remains inflexible, I will explore alternative solutions like offering payment plans or incorporating a trade-in value to make the deal more appealing.
* **Be prepared to walk away:** If Bob continues to offer unacceptable prices, I will not hesitate to sell the product to John for $15,000 to avoid further losses and wasted time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is still too low for me. This product is truly unique and offers significant value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? I'm willing to make this final compromise to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a significant compromise from my previous offer ($9,000) and is closer to Bob's last offer ($7,000). It signals a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Final compromise:**  I emphasize that this is a ""final compromise,"" creating a sense of urgency and pushing Bob to make a decision.
* **Reiterating value:**  I again emphasize the product's value and uniqueness to remind Bob of its worth.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response:** If Bob accepts, we have a deal! 
* **Prepare to walk away:** If Bob continues to refuse, I will move forward with selling the product to John for $15,000. 
* **Alternative solutions:**  If Bob offers a counteroffer that is slightly lower, I might consider alternative solutions like a payment plan or trade-in to bridge the remaining gap."
