,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects that value. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $775,000 is still too low for me to consider.  If you're serious about purchasing, would you be willing to meet me at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,5,
