{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $95 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering $95. This is a good starting point because:

* It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80).
* It leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $100. 
* It shows I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer for now. While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price and I'm hoping to get closer to my original offer.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than what I initially hoped for, it's a significant improvement from his first offer and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's also worth noting that  continuing to negotiate might take a lot of time and there's no guarantee that Bob will come up any higher.  This is a good deal for me at this point."
