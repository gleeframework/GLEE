"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite low, but I'm willing to come down to $130 for you. I believe this product offers significant value, and I wouldn't want to go any lower than that.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $130 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $80? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",80.0,Bob,4,
