"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This would be a fair price considering the product's benefits for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. Can we discuss further?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $15,500? This would be a win-win for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. Can we make a deal?",13500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your offers, but I've already got another buyer ready to pay $15,000.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic.  Is there any way you can meet me at $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,7,
