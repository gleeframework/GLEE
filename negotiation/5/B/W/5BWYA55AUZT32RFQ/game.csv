"Alice,  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
