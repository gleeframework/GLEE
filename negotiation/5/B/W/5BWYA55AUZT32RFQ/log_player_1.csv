Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
