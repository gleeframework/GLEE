Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $75 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $75 is below my minimum threshold, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $80. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum threshold, and it's a good deal for me. I'll accept his offer and avoid the risk of losing the sale to John or needing to negotiate further."
