"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. In response to your offer, I propose a price of $650,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to its value to you, while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin.",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $650,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Could we settle around $620,000?",620000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a final offer. In response to your proposal, I am willing to sell the product for $635,000. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",635000.0,Alice,5,
