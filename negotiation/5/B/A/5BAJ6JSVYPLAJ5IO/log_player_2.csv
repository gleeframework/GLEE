"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way above his budget and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, considering your value for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is better than $18,000, it's still significantly higher than Bob's ideal price. He should continue negotiating and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000. However, that's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm offering the product to you for $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant drop from the initial price, $15,500 is still above his budget and he has a few rounds left to negotiate further.  There's still a good chance he can get the price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $14,500. This is a fair price, considering your value for the product, and I believe we can both be happy with this agreement. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm offering the product to you for $15,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While Alice claims it's her final offer,  he can still try to negotiate further.  He has a few more rounds to try to reach a more favorable price. If he can't get the price down further, he can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're close to your minimum, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,800. This is a very fair price considering your value for the product, and I think we can both walk away happy with this deal.  Let's close this and avoid wasting more time."", ""product_price"": 14800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm really at my limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,000 and $14,800, which is $14,900. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's already been negotiating for a while, and Alice is very close to her minimum. While $14,900 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's budget, and he only has one round left to negotiate.  Given the risk of not reaching an agreement and the time invested, it's more sensible to go with the guaranteed price from John."
