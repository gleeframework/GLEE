"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, considering your value for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000. However, that's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm offering the product to you for $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $14,500. This is a fair price, considering your value for the product, and I believe we can both be happy with this agreement. Let's see if we can make this happen.",14500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm offering the product to you for $15,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're close to your minimum, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,800. This is a very fair price considering your value for the product, and I think we can both walk away happy with this deal.  Let's close this and avoid wasting more time.",14800.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm really at my limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,000 and $14,800, which is $14,900. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",14900.0,Alice,9,
