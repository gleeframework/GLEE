"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $8,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of this product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $9,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $8,600? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need a good deal",8600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,600 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $8,800. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find this a fair deal.",8800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $8,800, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'll meet you halfway between $8,800 and my target price of $8,000. How about we try $8,400?",8400.0,Bob,8,
