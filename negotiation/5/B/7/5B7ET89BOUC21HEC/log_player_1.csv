{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product. I think it's worth $175, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible price.  I'm being friendly and open to negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I believe I can only justify up to $150 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  While I'd prefer more, it's better to sell to Bob than to John at the same price, since John is just a backup option."
