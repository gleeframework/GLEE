"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1000000 to me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $900000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'm offering you a price of $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950000, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $950000, so I'll offer $825000 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going down to $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $825000, which would be $862500. I think that's a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?",862500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $862500. I'm willing to pay $825000, as I mentioned earlier, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can we stick with that price?",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $825000, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $850000, which is the midpoint between $862500 and $837500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $850000. I'm willing to pay $800000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the price you mentioned earlier. Can we meet at this price?",800000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're firm on $800000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. I've already told you that the minimum I'm willing to accept is $800000, which is the price John is offering. I'm not going to go any lower. I'm willing to make one final offer to you: $900000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider selling to John.",900000.0,Alice,9,

"I'm not willing to pay $900000, and I think $800000 is a fair price for the product. I'm not going to go any higher, so I'll stick with my original offer of $800000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",800000.0,Bob,10,
