Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. Can you consider this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

Explanation:

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches John's standing offer, there's no guarantee Bob will go any higher. It's unlikely we'll get a better offer from Bob, and further negotiation carries the risk of him lowering his offer or stalling. Taking John's guaranteed $1,500,000 is the safest and most logical decision at this point."
