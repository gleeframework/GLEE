# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it could be equally valuable for you. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. This is a significant price point, but I'm confident in the product's value.  What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $700,000 is quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $850,000?  This would allow us both to get a good deal.
