# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her minimum acceptable value but within your budget.** This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* **You have a higher limit ($1,500,000), which gives you a better position to negotiate.**
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.**"

{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks promising, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair price, given the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
