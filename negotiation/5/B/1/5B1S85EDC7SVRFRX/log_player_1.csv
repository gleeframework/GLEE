Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, significantly higher than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a good price if Bob is truly interested. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage with the offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob to create interest.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Upside in Counteroffer:** I can't expect to get more from Bob.
* **Time is Money:**  A counteroffer would prolong the negotiation, potentially leading to further rejections and wasting time.

**Conclusion:**

Since I'm already at my minimum price and I'm not sure about Bob's willingness to negotiate further, accepting his offer is the most efficient choice."
