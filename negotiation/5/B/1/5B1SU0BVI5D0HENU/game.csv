"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can sell the product to you for $100. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair deal considering the value of the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $85, so I'd like to propose $92.50 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $92.50 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can sell the product to you for $97.50. It's the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value of the product.",97.5,Alice,7,
