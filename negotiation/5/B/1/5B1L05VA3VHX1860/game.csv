"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on the product and is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of my product. Considering the original worth of the product to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still allows you to get a good price for the product. What do you think?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,325,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's original worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous one. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,312,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1312500.0,Alice,5,
