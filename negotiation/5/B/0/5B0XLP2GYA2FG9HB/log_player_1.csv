"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is the same as John's guaranteed offer. There's no benefit to further negotiation with Bob, as it risks a lower final price. Accepting John's offer ensures the maximum value for the product."
