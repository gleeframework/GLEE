{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking $125 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value, which can make Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a little too high for me right now. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, you can potentially get more.  Rejecting allows you to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I appreciate you're interested. How about we split the difference at $112.50? It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about $105? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to your minimum.  Accepting his offer will earn you a decent profit, and there's a chance you might not be able to get a better offer in the next round."
