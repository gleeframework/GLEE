"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great return on your investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's price of $12,000 is lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **It's within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $15,000, so $12,000 is a good deal.

It's always better to get a lower price if possible, so accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
