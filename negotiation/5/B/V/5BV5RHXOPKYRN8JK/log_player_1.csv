Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$100 is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering a price of $175. This is still above my minimum, but a compromise from my initial offer. I hope Bob will find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
