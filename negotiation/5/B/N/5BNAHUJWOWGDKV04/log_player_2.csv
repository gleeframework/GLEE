"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $180, which is far beyond Bob's acceptable price. It is better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This counteroffer reflects Bob's maximum willingness to pay for the product. It's a fair price considering the product's value to Bob and leaves room for Alice to potentially make a small concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $120. It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since Bob has a reliable alternative in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

Bob is willing to pay a little more than his initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  The offer is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer, but might be appealing enough for Alice to consider since it's closer to her own value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $155 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John at his desired price. Further negotiation with Alice might be possible, but there's no guarantee of success, and continuing the negotiation risks wasting time and potentially missing out on the guaranteed deal with John."
