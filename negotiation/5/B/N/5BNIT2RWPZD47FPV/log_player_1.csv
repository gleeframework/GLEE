This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $100 is a good price, it's still lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is a little low for me.  How about $110? That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

$105 is a good price and very close to my initial offer.  I'm happy to sell it to Bob at that price."
