Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,500. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality and I believe you'll find it very valuable."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $15,000. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John.

Offering the product at $14,500 creates a potential win-win situation:

* **Bob:**  Gets the product at a price potentially lower than he expected, saving $500 compared to your guaranteed sale price.
* **Alice:**  You make a profit of $14,500, which is close to your desired minimum and avoids the hassle of waiting for John's purchase.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept."
