``` 
At this point, you've gone back and forth a few times with Bob. While you could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's likely that he's firm on his offer of $125.  You've already gone below your minimum price of $120 and you're in round 6. Accepting his offer will allow you to close the deal and move on."
