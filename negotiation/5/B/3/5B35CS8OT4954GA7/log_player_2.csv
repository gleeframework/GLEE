{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $85 is a good price, but you want to see if you can get it lower. 
* You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate. 
*  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price $10 lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* This is a significant discount, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit if she's willing to negotiate.
* I'm trying to gauge her willingness to compromise and see how much she's willing to come down in price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is coming up slightly from her initial offer, but it's still not within my desired price range.
* I'm still willing to negotiate further, and I believe I can get a better price.
* I'm confident that I can secure a deal with Alice for less than $90 in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* $80 is still a good price for me, and it's likely that Alice will find it acceptable.
* I believe that this counteroffer will be close enough to her desired price that she'll accept it."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is increasing her price again, and it's starting to get close to my maximum price.
* However, I'm still not willing to pay $95. I believe I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating. 
* I'm confident I can get the price down closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly not willing to go below $90, and I'm not willing to go above $85.
*  I'm offering a middle ground that's a compromise for both of us.
* With only 5 rounds left, it's important to find a solution that both parties can agree on."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is not willing to negotiate lower than $100.
* This is getting closer to my maximum price of $120, and I don't want to risk going any higher.
*  Buying from John at $120 is a guaranteed price that's within my budget. 
*  It's better to secure a deal with John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
