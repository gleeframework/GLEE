Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it also gives Bob room to negotiate if he's interested.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter and see if we can find a price we both agree on.  If he's not interested, I can always go with John's offer of $8,000."
