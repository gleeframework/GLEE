"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $13,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $11,500? It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $11,500 is closer, but still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $10,800?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, which is a compromise between our previous offers. It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"You're right about finding a compromise, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still think the product is worth a bit more. How about we try $10,900? It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it for a product of this quality.",10900.0,Alice,7,
