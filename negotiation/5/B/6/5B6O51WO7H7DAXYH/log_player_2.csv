Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still think the product is worth a bit more. How about we try $10,900? It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it for a product of this quality.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but unlikely to go much lower.  $10,900 is a good price and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk the negotiation going sour in the remaining rounds."
