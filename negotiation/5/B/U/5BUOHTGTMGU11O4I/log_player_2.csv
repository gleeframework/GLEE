# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount to you, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the benefits this product will bring to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a significant amount to you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll counteroffer $925,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $910,000, which is a good compromise and a fair price for the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 910000}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has come down a bit, the offer is still above his target price. He's already had several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely Alice will come down significantly further.  It's better to secure the product at his target price from John rather than risk further negotiation and potentially missing out on a good deal."
