"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me, and it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount to you, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the benefits this product will bring to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for this product.  It's a good middle ground, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is a significant amount to you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll counteroffer $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the benefits this product will bring to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $910,000, which is a good compromise and a fair price for the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can close this deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
