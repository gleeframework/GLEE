Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $800,000 to both you and Bob, there's room for negotiation. Starting high gives you leverage and the potential to secure a much higher profit.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer gauges Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. His response will guide your next move in the negotiation.
* **Fallback option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 with John, so you can afford to be bold in your initial ask."
