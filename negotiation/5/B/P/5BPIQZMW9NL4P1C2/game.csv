"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",170.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While I'm interested, $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. Let me think for a moment... Ah, I've got it! I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle at $150, and I'll take it off your hands.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $150. I've already compromised a lot, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $160. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",160.0,Alice,5,
