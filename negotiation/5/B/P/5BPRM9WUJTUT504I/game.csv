"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of this product. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay at this time. I'm willing to offer $12,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to see you moving closer to my initial offer, $13,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $13,000, which represents a significant concession on my part. This would allow us both to secure a good deal.  I'm confident we can find common ground at this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $13,250. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering the value the product brings to you. What are your thoughts?",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I acknowledge the value you're placing on this product, I'm still feeling a bit hesitant about $13,250.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I can see you're committed to this deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to budge much further from my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you at $13,125, but that's as low as I can go. It's a small concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13125.0,Alice,7,
