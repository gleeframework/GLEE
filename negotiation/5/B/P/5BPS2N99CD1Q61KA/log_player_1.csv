{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price, but still lower than the product's value to Bob.  This leaves room for negotiation while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below my ideal goal. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or potentially even a higher offer from other potential buyers if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and ensure a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $920,000 is still a good deal and close to my ideal target. Accepting this offer would secure a sale for a significant profit and minimize the risk of further negotiation."
