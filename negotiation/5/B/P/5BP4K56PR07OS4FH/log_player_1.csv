"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's significantly above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will either accept or counter with a reasonable offer. This allows for some negotiation room while still setting a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,500. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more. It's a middle ground that could potentially lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my target price and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and allows me to get a good price without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
