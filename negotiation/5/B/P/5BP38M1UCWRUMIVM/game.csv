"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $60 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $90. This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a little too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $75? That feels like a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $75 isn't enough for me.  Let's try one more time to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $85? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a small profit. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close to my limit. I could do $80, but that's absolutely the highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
