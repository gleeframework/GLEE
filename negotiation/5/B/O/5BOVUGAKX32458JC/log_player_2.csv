"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $115 is a decent price, it's still above his maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  I can come down a little, but $110 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $112.50 is lower than Bob's maximum of $120.
* **Progress is being made:** Alice has moved from $115 to $112.50, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk of losing a good deal:**  There's a risk that if Bob continues to reject offers, Alice might get frustrated and stop negotiating altogether, leaving Bob with only the option to buy from John at a higher price.

While Bob might prefer to push for a lower price,  $112.50 is a reasonable compromise and a good deal considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
