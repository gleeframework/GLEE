Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot more to me, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum price. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and acknowledges Bob's perspective while also emphasizing my own value for the product. This sets a positive tone for negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  $12,000 is a good starting point, and I can still negotiate further if necessary.
* **Keep Bob interested:** Offering a price close to his perceived value will make him more likely to engage in negotiations. 
* **Maintain my leverage:** By offering a price lower than my minimum, I create space for negotiation while still protecting my interests.

I will continue to assess Bob's responses and adapt my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its value while also allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I consider fair. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range. I'll leverage John's offer as a bargaining chip and aim for a counteroffer that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,500. I'm confident this price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $11,500 is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price.
* **Message:**  The message is still positive and acknowledges Bob's proposal while emphasizing the value of the product. I'm presenting a price that I believe is a fair compromise, setting the stage for a potential agreement.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering with a price closer to Bob's offer, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still holding firm to a price that is closer to my desired range, using John's offer as leverage to ensure I don't settle for an unacceptably low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I am willing to move forward with a counteroffer of $11,000 for your product. I believe this price is fair for both parties and brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $11,000 is very close to my previous offer of $11,500.  It's within a range that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's likely we won't get closer to my desired price.  

By accepting this offer, I can secure a sale and avoid the potential risk of further negotiations that might not be fruitful.  While I'm not getting my ideal price, $11,000 is still a significant profit compared to selling to John for $15,000."
