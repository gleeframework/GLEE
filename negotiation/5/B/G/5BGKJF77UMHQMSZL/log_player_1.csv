Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000:** This is a good starting point. It's lower than Bob's perceived value but still gives me a significant profit over my minimum of $10,000.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob gets from the deal. It's also open to negotiation, inviting Bob to respond.

This offer balances earning a good price with leaving room for negotiation, ensuring the conversation continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $11000?  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $13,000.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my goal. 
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer, but reiterates my desire for a higher price.  It highlights the value for Bob while remaining open to finding a solution."
