"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. Is this within your budget?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $950000 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1020000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can shake hands on this.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
