"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher final price. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces that the product is worth a significant sum. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""mutually beneficial agreement"" signals to Bob that you are open to discussing the price and finding a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is the absolute minimum he's willing to pay and significantly below your minimum. It's too early to accept such a low offer. We have room to negotiate and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:**  Politely reiterate that Bob's offer is too low and doesn't reflect the product's value.
* **Significant Concession (Appearing to):**  While $1,300,000 is still a substantial profit margin, framing it as a ""coming down"" creates the impression of a significant move on your part.
* **Reiteration of Value:**  Continue to emphasize the product's value to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still below our absolute minimum. Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and we have enough rounds left to try and push for a better deal.  We are in a strong position with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to accept $1,225,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introduce Competition (John):** This creates a sense of urgency and reinforces that your product is in demand.  
* **Finality:** By stating this is your ""final offer"" you signal you're unwilling to go much lower.
* **Small Concession, Justified:** Moving to $1,225,000 is a small concession but positions it as a substantial compromise to try to close the deal."
