"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product at $100, which is a good starting point, knowing it's worth $120 to Bob. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Leaving room for negotiation allows me to potentially close the deal at a higher price than $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  While $90 is better than $80, I know the product is worth $120 to Bob, so there's still room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Rounds Remaining:** I still have 9 rounds, so I can afford to be a bit more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested. I understand you want a good deal, but $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility but still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Middle Ground:**  I'm suggesting meeting in the middle, implying a willingness to compromise while still benefiting from the negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep Bob engaged."
