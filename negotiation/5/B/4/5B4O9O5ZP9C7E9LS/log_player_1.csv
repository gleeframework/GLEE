Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed, but also maximizes your potential profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price without revealing your minimum. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage even if he finds the initial price high.

By setting the initial offer at $1,500,000, you aim to either:

* **Secure a highly profitable sale to Bob**, or
* **Negotiate down to a price still above your minimum**, ensuring you make more than selling directly to John."
