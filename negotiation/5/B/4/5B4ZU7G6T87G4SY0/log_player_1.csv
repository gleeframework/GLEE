"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
