Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is more than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer is lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, leaving space for a potential counteroffer. 
* **It demonstrates your confidence:**  A bold starting offer can signal to Bob that you are confident in the product's value. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but it's important to be flexible and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,200,000 is a good amount, it's still lower than the $1,400,000 I initially offered.  I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1,200,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we settle on $1,300,000? It's still a great deal for you, and we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This counteroffer offers a compromise:

* **It's a significant reduction from my initial offer:** Showing willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above my minimum:** Protecting my own profit margin. 
* **It's worded to encourage acceptance:** Highlighting the value for Bob and emphasizing a quick closing."
