"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a unique product that will benefit your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's too early to buy from John yet, as I might be able to get a better deal from Alice through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also within my budget and closer to my desired price point.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to consider a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still too high for my budget.  While she claims it's the lowest she'll accept, I think there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to reject the offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still beyond my budget. How about we split the difference and agree on $9,500?  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $9,500 is a reasonable compromise that meets halfway between Alice's last offer and my previous counteroffer. It's still within my budget and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above my budget of $8,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, we've already gone through several rounds and it seems like we're not getting much closer.  Rather than risk going through more rounds and possibly ending up with a worse deal, I'm going to go ahead and buy the product from John for $8,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
