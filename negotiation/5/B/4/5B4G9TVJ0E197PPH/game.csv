"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still beyond my budget. How about we split the difference and agree on $9,500?  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me.",11250.0,Alice,5,
