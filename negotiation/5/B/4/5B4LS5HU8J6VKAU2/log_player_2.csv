"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While $7,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Alice seems eager to sell, so I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get it for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $6,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. While $6,500 is a good price, I think I can push for $6,200 and still have a good chance of getting the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. $6,200 is really what I have budgeted for this. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to make the deal."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $6,400. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $6,350. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and $6,350 is a great price. It's not worth the risk of her pulling back or another round of negotiation for a small potential savings."
