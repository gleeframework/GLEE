"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better opportunity elsewhere. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the value of the product. However, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $975,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $975,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you at $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
