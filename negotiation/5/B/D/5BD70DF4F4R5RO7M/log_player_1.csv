Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find immense value in. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 2300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your absolute minimum. This gives you room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a great outcome. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even though it's much higher than his valuation, it sets the stage for the negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  I am aware that John is offering $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. However, the goal is to maximize profit, so starting the negotiation higher with Bob is strategically advantageous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). I have room to negotiate and see if I can get him closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value this product brings is significant. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000?"", ""product_price"": 1900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This classic negotiation tactic suggests a spirit of compromise, which can be helpful in moving things forward. 
* **Significant Drop, But Still Above Minimum:** I've made a considerable drop from my initial offer to show flexibility. However, I'm still well above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum, allowing room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see you've made an effort to meet in the middle, Alice. While I appreciate that, I still need to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my absolute minimum selling price offered by John ($1,500,000). While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, or the negotiations could drag on. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and a quicker close to the deal."
