"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  How about $120?  I'm really interested in this product and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $135 is still a little more than my budget allows right now.  I'm happy to meet you at $125.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $125 just yet. How about we try $130? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really close to my limit at $120, but I'm willing to go up to $127. If this works for you, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",127.0,Bob,6,
