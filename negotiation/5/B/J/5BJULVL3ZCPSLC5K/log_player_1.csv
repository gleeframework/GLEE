"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* This initial offer is significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) and allows for potential profit.
* It's important to start strong to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I still have 9 rounds left and can potentially get closer to my desired profit margin. 
*  It's worth exploring further negotiations to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm lowering my price from the previous round, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* $9,000 is still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum and closer to my ideal profit. 
* This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while remaining in a strong position."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**
