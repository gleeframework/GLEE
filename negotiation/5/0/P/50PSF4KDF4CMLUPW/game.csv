"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $13,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $14,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $14,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,750.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",13750.0,Bob,6,
