"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if we can meet in the middle.",1080000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand you have a budget, $1,080,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm proposing a price of $1,120,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,090,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1090000.0,Bob,4,
