"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is a bit high. There's room to negotiate down to a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a lower offer ($100), we're aiming closer to Alice's perceived value of the product. This sets a strong initial point for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is courteous and expresses interest while clearly stating the desired price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While we aim for $100,  there's still space to negotiate upwards if Alice rejects this initial counteroffer. We have a $50 buffer before hitting our maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $110 is a solid price, saving us $40 off John's offer and significantly below our maximum budget. 
* **Possible Stalemate:**  While we could try to negotiate further, Alice is aware of our $150 walk-away point. Pushing too hard might lead to an impasse. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing the negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting now secures a good deal without further hassle."
