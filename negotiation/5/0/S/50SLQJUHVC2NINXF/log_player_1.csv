"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob but allows room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a good deal while leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better outcome, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of losing the sale to John."
