"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is below its true value. How about we settle at $1,650,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your willingness to engage.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,550,000. Can we find a mutually agreeable price?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're getting closer.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
