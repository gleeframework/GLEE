"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We can try negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start significantly lower than Alice's offer to give us room to negotiate upwards.  
* **Polite and Positive:** The message is framed positively to maintain a good negotiating relationship.  
* **Clear Target:** By stating our desired price upfront, we give Alice a clear understanding of our expectations. 

This counter-offer allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's counter-offer is lower, it's still above our $80 budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice seems willing to negotiate, so we can try pushing for a better price.
* **John as Backup:** We have the security of buying from John at $80 if the negotiation doesn't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to being able to afford it. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That would work for me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Middle Ground:**  We're signaling willingness to compromise by moving closer to the middle ground between our previous offer ($60) and Alice's counter-offer ($90). 
* **Specific Price:**  By suggesting $75, we're providing a concrete target for Alice to consider.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:** The message keeps a positive and collaborative tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $85. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice's offer of $85 is only slightly above our $80 budget. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If we push further and Alice rejects our counter-offer, we might miss out on the deal entirely.  
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort with no guarantee of a better outcome.

While we could try for $80, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of prolonging the negotiation or losing the deal altogether."
