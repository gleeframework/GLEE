"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $11800 is a better price, but I'm still hoping to be closer to $11000.  Would you be willing to come down to $11500?  That would be a great middle ground for us both.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll offer you a compromise: $11700.
