"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better price by continuing negotiations.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  Bob wants to push for the lowest possible price and is starting with a significant counteroffer. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating.
* **Reasonable but challenging:**  $11,500 is still a decent profit for Alice, considering her own value of $12,000. It's a challenging offer, but not unreasonable.
* **Clear communication:** The message is friendly but firm, highlighting Bob's interest while stating his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $13,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $12,500 is a fair price for Bob. It's a significant discount from John's price and still leaves Alice with a profit.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, the risk of Alice rejecting and potentially asking for more is high. 
* **Time is a factor:** With 7 rounds left, accepting this offer means Bob can secure the product at a good price and potentially have time for other negotiations or activities."
