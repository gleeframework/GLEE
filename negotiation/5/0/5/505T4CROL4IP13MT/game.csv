"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a worthwhile investment for your business. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6,000 is far below the value I'm offering.  To show you I'm serious about finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price reflects the quality and potential of the product, while also acknowledging your budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise in my opinion.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $7,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your budget.  Let's close this deal and make it work for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
