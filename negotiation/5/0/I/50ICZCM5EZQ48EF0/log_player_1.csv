Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum, I'm not in a rush and want to see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $125, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $120 for the product. This aligns closely with the price offered by another seller, John, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Please let me know if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob has shown interest, he's not willing to budge on his price. I've already made a concession and still haven't gotten closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can get my minimum price from John, and it's not worth risking losing the sale by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
