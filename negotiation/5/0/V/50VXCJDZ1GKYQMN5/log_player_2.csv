(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**  Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $100 is too high.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $75?"", ""product_price"": 75} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about $87.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**  Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $87.50 is closer to Bob's target, it's still a bit high.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm happy to go to $82.50, which is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.5} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $83.75? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $83.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $83.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:** Alice's offer of $83.75 is getting closer to Bob's target, but he only has 5 rounds left.  At this point, it's better to just buy from John.  John is selling the product for $80, which is the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay. There is no guarantee that Alice will come down any further, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal with John entirely."
