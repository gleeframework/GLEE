"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can get closer to my initial offer of $800,000.  How about we split the difference and agree on $825,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that works.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer you the product for $860,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again if needed.",860000.0,Alice,5,
