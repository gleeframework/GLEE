"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum. Let's compromise one last time at $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
