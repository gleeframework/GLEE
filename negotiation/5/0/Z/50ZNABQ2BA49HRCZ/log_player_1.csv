Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer starts with a friendly message to build rapport with Bob.  The price of $100 is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I can potentially get a higher price by counteroffering.  I'll see if I can push for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, and $85 is closer to my desired price. However, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original offer.  Would you be willing to consider $95? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $90. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum price of $120 than my initial offer.  It's also a reasonable compromise.  Accepting his offer allows me to avoid potentially further negotiation and ensures I secure a sale at a price that's above my minimum threshold."
