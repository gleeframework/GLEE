"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to him without explicitly revealing his potential profit margin.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to secure a deal closer to Bob's perceived value while leaving options open if he's not immediately agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 to make the transaction more favorable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both my target and his perceived value. Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Demonstrate Flexibility:**  By not immediately accepting, I show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not at any cost.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  Rejecting an offer too quickly can weaken my negotiating position. 
* **Aim Higher:** I believe a more favorable agreement is possible within the remaining rounds. 

I'm comfortable rejecting this offer and proposing a counteroffer closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This recognizes the product's value while also offering you a considerable return."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I've reduced my price by $50,000, demonstrating movement and a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still anchoring the deal above $1 million, emphasizing the product's intrinsic worth.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** By highlighting the ""considerable return"" for Bob, I'm framing the counteroffer as beneficial to both parties, not just a concession on my part.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer encourages Bob to make a more substantial move towards my desired price range in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with a price of $1,000,000. This offers a balance between the value of the product and what I am willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 represents a strong compromise and meets my minimum acceptable price threshold. Here's why accepting is the best course of action:

* **Exceeds Minimum:** This offer is well above my $800,000 minimum and provides a substantial profit.
* **Strong Position:** Bob has consistently moved his offer closer to my asking price, indicating a strong desire to acquire the product.  
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations further might not yield a significantly better offer, and there's always a risk that Bob could walk away. Securing a deal now eliminates uncertainty. 

While I might be able to push for slightly more in subsequent rounds, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures a highly favorable outcome."
