"Bob, I understand your desire to save, but $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product offers you. Let's make this deal work!",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I value our ongoing negotiation, but $925,000 isn't quite reaching the point where it makes sense for me. I'm prepared to come down to $960,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the final offer I'm willing to make. Let's finalize this deal,  it's a win-win for both of us.",960000.0,Alice,5,
