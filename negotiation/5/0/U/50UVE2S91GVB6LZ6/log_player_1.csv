Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Minimum:**  I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me. 
* **Potential Upside:** I want to maximize my profit, so I'm going to try for a higher price. 
* **Risk Assessment:** I'm willing to risk Bob rejecting the offer because I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John. 

By offering $1,500,000, I'm hoping to strike a balance between getting a good price and not scaring Bob away completely."
