"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000.  I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $22,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $12,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value here.  How about we settle at $16,000? This offer represents a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $16,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $14,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually agreeable deal.  Let's see if we can come together on this price.",14000.0,Bob,6,
