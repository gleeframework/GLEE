"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves me some profit. This will hopefully encourage him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. How about we settle on $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I initially offered, but I am still confident that I can get a better price.  I will counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference and settle on $135? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit lower than what I'd prefer, but it's getting closer to my goal.  Considering that I'm already in round 4 and don't want to risk losing the deal completely, I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $130."
