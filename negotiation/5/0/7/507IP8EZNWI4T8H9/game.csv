"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $900,000? This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to be transparent. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $875,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. If you're willing to accept this offer, we can finalize the deal today.",875000.0,Alice,5,
