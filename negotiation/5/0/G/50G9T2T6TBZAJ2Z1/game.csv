"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm confident that it can bring you substantial returns.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price that acknowledges the potential of the product while also allowing for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
