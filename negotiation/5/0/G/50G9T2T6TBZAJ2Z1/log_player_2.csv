"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm confident that it can bring you substantial returns.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the best possible price. While Alice has come down from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to counteroffer again and potentially get closer to his desired price point."

I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price that acknowledges the potential of the product while also allowing for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
