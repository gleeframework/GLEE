Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Anchoring:**  My initial high offer helps anchor the negotiation. By significantly reducing the price, I signal flexibility but maintain a strong position.
* **Urgency:**  Stating ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Alternative:** I still have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if Bob rejects this offer, so I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,000 is still a bit much, how about $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $7,500 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Profitable:** It's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and a decent profit over my minimum.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations takes time and effort. Accepting now secures the deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I risk losing him entirely. Accepting ensures a good outcome."
