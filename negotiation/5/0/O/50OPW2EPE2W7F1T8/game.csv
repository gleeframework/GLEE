"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $11000 to show my commitment to finding a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I really want to make this work. I'm willing to go as low as $10500. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to another buyer. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid I won't be able to go above $10000. I'll have to pass on this deal. I'll consider buying the product from John for $10000 instead.",10000.0,Bob,6,
