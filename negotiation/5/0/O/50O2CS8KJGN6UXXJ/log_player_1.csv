"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  He knows the product is worth $800,000 to him, but I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $1,500,000 as possible. This price leaves room for negotiation without immediately hitting my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum but I believe I can get a better price.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob for a higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than Bob is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied. It is too far from my minimum of $1,500,000, and I still have more rounds to negotiate.  I'm not going to sell to John yet because I still believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but this time I'm getting closer to my minimum. I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's value for the product and my minimum. This might be the point where Bob starts getting closer to accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is not meeting my minimum value, and we are running out of time.  Even though I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I can't risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
