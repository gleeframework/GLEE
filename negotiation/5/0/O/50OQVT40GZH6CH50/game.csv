"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $9000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal for you given the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8750. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value. Let me know what you think!",8750.0,Bob,4,
