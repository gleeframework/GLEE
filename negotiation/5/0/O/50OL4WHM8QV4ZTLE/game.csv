"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you considering me first. While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $16,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $17,000? It's closer to your price and still within my budget.",17000.0,Bob,4,
