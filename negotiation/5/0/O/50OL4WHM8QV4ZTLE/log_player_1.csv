Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. Given its value, I believe a price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you considering me first. While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $16,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $17,000? It's closer to your price and still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000

While I could push for more, accepting $17,000 is a solid profit over my minimum ($15,000) and John's offer. There's always a risk Bob walks away if I push too hard."
