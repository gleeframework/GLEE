"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the value I know you place on it.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still out of my price range. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $10000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it while still allowing you to make a profit.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, $10000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16000 is still above my budget.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it while still allowing you to make a decent profit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $12000 is still not enough for me to make a profit that I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $12000, which would be $14000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm going to have to stick with my last offer of $12000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it while still allowing you to make a profit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,8,
