"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This reflects the product's value and leaves some room for a fair deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
