Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate while ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value and deal aspect to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for negotiation, implying that I'm open to discussing the price further.

This approach allows me to maximize potential profit while also maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  Rejecting allows me to:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  By rejecting, I show I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away. This positions me stronger in the negotiation.
* **Explore a Better Offer:**  I can counter with a price closer to my minimum, potentially finding a midpoint that's more acceptable to both of us.

Selling to John right now would guarantee the minimum, but there's still a chance I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This reflects the product's value and leaves some room for a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price higher than his offer but lower than my previous offer. This shows willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price point. 
* **Open to Further Discussion:** The message leaves room for additional negotiation, suggesting flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Increase Profit:**  $9,000 is closer to my desired profit than Bob's offer.
* **Maintain Control:**  I'm still holding a strong negotiating position by not accepting his initial offer.
* **Explore a Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer encourages Bob to consider a price that benefits both of us."
