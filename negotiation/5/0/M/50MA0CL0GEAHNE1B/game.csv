"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $1,000,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if you're interested!",1000000.0,Alice,3,
