"Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $160. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"I can see you're serious about getting this product, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you a price of $145. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go to $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",135.0,Bob,6,
