"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to go down to $10,500.  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still being reasonable for your budget.",10500.0,Alice,5,
