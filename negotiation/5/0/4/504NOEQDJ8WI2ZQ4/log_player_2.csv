"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, there's no reason to jump at the first offer.  Rejecting allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($120 vs $150) is a strong negotiating tactic. This signals you're serious about buying but are also looking for a good deal. It also gives Alice room to counter without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows you to continue pushing for a lower price.  You could potentially get Alice down to $130 or even $125 with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still above my ideal price.  Offering $130 keeps the pressure on Alice to come down while also demonstrating that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within my budget and a decent compromise. There's always a chance I could get it lower, but with only 5 rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating. Accepting secures the product at a good price, and I still have some room to play with if I need to buy something else later."
