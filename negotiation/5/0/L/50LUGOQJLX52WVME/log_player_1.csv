Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you, considering your valuation.  Let me know what you think.

While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $975,000?
