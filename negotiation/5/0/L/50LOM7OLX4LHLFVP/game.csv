"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, my budget allows me to pay up to $1,100,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, considering my financial situation, I am only able to commit to a maximum of $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer aligns better with the product's value and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
