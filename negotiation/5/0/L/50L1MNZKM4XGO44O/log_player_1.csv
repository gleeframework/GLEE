"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the potential profit.  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, this offer gives him some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm lowering my offer to $10,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a good profit."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful I can squeeze out a bit more profit.  The counteroffer in the next round will be my last chance to get a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}

This is my final counteroffer. It's very close to Bob's last offer, and it's the highest I'm willing to go.  If Bob rejects this, I'll move on to John and sell the product for $8,000."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's only a bit less than my last counteroffer, and I'm running out of rounds.  I need to secure a sale before I risk having to sell to John for a lower price."
