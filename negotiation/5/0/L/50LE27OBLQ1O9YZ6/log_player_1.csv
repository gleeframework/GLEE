"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it will greatly benefit you.  As a starting point, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice needs to aim high initially. This leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's value to Alice.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,100,000 offer is significantly above Bob's valuation but below Alice's minimum. This gap allows for a back-and-forth negotiation where both parties can feel like they're getting a deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone is crucial to a successful negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that Alice has the John backup offer ($1,200,000) if negotiations with Bob are unsuccessful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is too close to his valuation and far below Alice's minimum. Accepting would result in a significant loss for Alice.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, his message expresses strong interest. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** Alice still has the option to sell to John for her full desired price. This provides leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position.  However, the value this product brings is significant, and $850,000 is considerably below what I can accept. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** Alice lowers her price by $100,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate but also demonstrating the product's value.
* **Midpoint Target:**  This counteroffer aims towards a price point around $900,000-$950,000, which is a more reasonable compromise for both parties.
* **Justification:** Alice continues to reinforce the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its benefits. 
* **Time Pressure (Implied):**  With each round, the possibility of Alice selling to John increases, creating implicit time pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this deal.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Price:** $900,000 is a significant profit above Bob's initial offer and a reasonable compromise for Alice, even though it's below her ideal price. 
* **Strong Signals from Bob:**  Bob's message shows a clear desire to close the deal. He's increased his offer substantially and is using language that emphasizes finding a solution.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for more risks Bob walking away.  While John offers $1,200,000, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Accepting $900,000 guarantees a good profit."
