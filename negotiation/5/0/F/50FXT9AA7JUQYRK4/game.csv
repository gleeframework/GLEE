"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know you've been looking for something like this, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,750,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $1,400,000? ",1400000.0,Bob,4,
