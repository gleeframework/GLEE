We're still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a little further."

Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. It's time to stand firm and see if he's willing to move closer to our price."

Round 7

Bob is circling back to his previous offer. This indicates he might be getting stuck and our firm stance is having an effect.  We're still well above John's offer and have room to negotiate, but we need to signal we're nearing our limit."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but I need you to understand the value of what I'm offering.  I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,140,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential this product holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1140000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Finality:**  By stating this is our ""final concession"" and ""absolute bottom line,"" we create a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Reiterating Value:** We want to keep Bob focused on the potential profit he stands to gain, reminding him why he's been pursuing the deal in the first place. 
* **Slight Concession:**  Coming down slightly to $1,140,000 shows we're willing to negotiate but holds a strong position above John's offer.

This approach aims to either close the deal now at a favorable price or prompt Bob to reveal his true willingness to pay in the final round."

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's final offer of $1,080,000 is below our target price, it's still significantly higher than John's standing offer of $800,000.  

Here's why accepting is the best option in Round 10:

* **Bird in Hand:**  We have a firm offer on the table. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a better price from Bob, and we risk losing him entirely.
* **Significant Profit:** Even at $1,080,000, we're securing a profit of $280,000. Holding out for more risks losing a substantial gain. 
* **Time Cost:**  Each round of negotiation represents a time cost.  Accepting now allows us to move forward with the sale and potentially pursue other opportunities. 

While we could reject Bob's offer and hope he increases it in a final counteroffer, it's a risky move. Bob has set a firm limit and we don't want to jeopardize a $1 million+ deal by pushing too hard in the final moments."
