"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There's no reason to buy from John yet, as Bob has 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should start by offering the absolute minimum he's willing to pay, which is $1,000,000. This sets a clear baseline and shows Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal. This also leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price. While it's a significant drop from the initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue to try and get a lower price, as he has more rounds left and the risk of buying from John is still present."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should offer a price that is still lower than Alice's current offer but higher than his initial counteroffer. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise, but is still trying to get a good deal. This also leaves room for negotiation in future rounds. Offering $1,250,000 is a good compromise, allowing for a potential middle ground in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit too high. Bob has several more rounds and can potentially get a better deal.  It's worth risking another round to try and get closer to his target of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should continue to increase his offer, but still stay below Alice's offer. This demonstrates that he is serious about buying the product, but is still trying to get a good deal. By offering $1,400,000, he is showing Alice that he is willing to meet her halfway, while still leaving room for further negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob has only 3 rounds remaining, but it's still worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's still a chance to get closer to his target of $1,000,000.  It's not worth risking buying from John at this point, as there's still potential to save money by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob needs to make a more aggressive counteroffer now. With only 2 rounds left, he needs to push for a lower price. Offering $1,450,000 shows he is serious about buying the product but is pushing for a price closer to his desired goal.  This is a significant increase from his previous offer and demonstrates that he's willing to meet Alice halfway. It also leaves room for a final compromise in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still only one round remaining.  There's a chance Bob can push for a lower price and potentially save more money. It's not worth risking buying from John yet, as there's still a possibility of getting a better deal from Alice. The risk is minimal, as he has only one round left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, so Bob needs to make a strong counteroffer. $1,500,000 is a reasonable price given the previous offers and negotiations.  It's a compromise, as it's higher than his previous offer but lower than Alice's current offer. This final offer shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also pushing for the best possible price."
