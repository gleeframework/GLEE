Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. Given my research, I believe a price closer to $1,200,000 would be more realistic for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
