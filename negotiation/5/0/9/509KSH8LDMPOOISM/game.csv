"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. Given my research, I believe a price closer to $1,200,000 would be more realistic for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,300,000?  This reflects the true value of this product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit high. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  Let's try $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the potential of this product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
