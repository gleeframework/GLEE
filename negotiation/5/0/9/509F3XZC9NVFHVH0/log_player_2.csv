"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no room for negotiation to save money. Buying from John immediately guarantees you the product at your limit, eliminating the risk of a prolonged negotiation with Alice that might end in a worse outcome."
