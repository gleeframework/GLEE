"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a good value for me.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work.  I believe this price still gives you a great deal on this valuable product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, so I'm offering $10,750. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
