"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet at $1,275,000.  This is a fair compromise that ensures both of us get a good deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
