Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has immense value for you, and I'm confident you'll see its potential.  My initial offer is $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation. It's best to reject and try to get a lower price."

Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, it's still above what you're comfortable with. You have some room to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet at $1,275,000.  This is a fair compromise that ensures both of us get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is very close to your ideal price of $1,250,000.  There's a chance you could negotiate further, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away.  Since you only have 5 rounds left, it's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's still within your budget.  You are saving $225,000 compared to buying from John."
