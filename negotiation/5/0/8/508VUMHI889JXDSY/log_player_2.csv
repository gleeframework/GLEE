"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting Alice's offer allows him to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, considering your value for it, and allows me to get a better price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet. While $1300000 is a good price, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is a good price for Bob. It's still significantly lower than John's price and closer to Bob's desired price point. There's a chance Bob could get an even lower price, but the risk of further negotiation could lead to Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer minimizes risk and secures a good deal."
