Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. How about $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still keeping me well above my minimum.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $99 might make Bob feel like he's getting a bad deal and could lead to rejection."
