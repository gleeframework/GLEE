Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  To be completely transparent, I have an alternative option to acquire a similar product for $800,000. I'd much prefer to work with you, but I need the price to be closer to that figure for it to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $815,000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is getting close to decision time. Let's analyze:

* **Bob's latest offer:** $815,000
* **Our minimum:** $1,200,000
* **John's guaranteed offer:** $1,200,000
* **Rounds remaining:** 4 

Bob has revealed his likely price ceiling is close to $800,000.  While we're aiming higher, the gap is significant. We need to decide if squeezing him further is worth the risk of him walking away.

Here's the decision:

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** We'll make one last strong counteroffer.  If Bob doesn't budge significantly, we'll take John's deal. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 than risk Bob walking away and potentially getting a worse deal later."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, and I understand this is valuable to you. I'm willing to increase my offer to $830,000.  However, I need to be upfront that if we can't agree on this, I'll have to move forward with my alternative option.  I believe this is a fair offer that acknowledges the value while working within my constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $830,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is it, the moment of truth. Let's analyze:

* **Bob's final offer:** $830,000
* **Our minimum:** $1,200,000
* **John's guaranteed offer:** $1,200,000
* **Rounds remaining:** 2

Bob has drawn a line in the sand. He's unlikely to go higher, and we risk losing him entirely if we push further. 

Here's the decision:

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $830,000 is a decent sum, it's a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,200,000. Bob has shown his hand, and it's not worth the risk of him walking away, leaving us with potentially nothing. John's deal ensures we achieve our minimum target."
