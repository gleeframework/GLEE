"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product.

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.
