Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential value the product has for Bob. This helps to build rapport and increase the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is still above my minimum price of $80, and it's likely that we won't get a better offer. It's better to accept and secure a sale rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or selling to John for $80."
