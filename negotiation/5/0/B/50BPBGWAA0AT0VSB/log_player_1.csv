Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value to you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point, offering a price that is a good compromise between your minimum and Bob's perceived value.  It allows room for negotiation but also ensures a good profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, $90 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum, and further negotiation might risk losing the sale altogether."
