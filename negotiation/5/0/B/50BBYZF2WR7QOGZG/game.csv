"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering me.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still too low for me.  Would you consider $11,500?  This would allow me to make this sale while still making a fair profit.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000, which would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
