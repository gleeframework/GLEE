"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
