"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your interest in the product is genuine, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. My counteroffer is $850,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $700,000.  Would you consider $750,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $750,000, which is $800,000. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. My final offer is $800,000 for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
