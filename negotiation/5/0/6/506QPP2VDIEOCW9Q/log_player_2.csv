"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for less from John.  While $10,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still save $2,000 by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget.  While I can't go down to $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,000? This still leaves room for you to save money compared to its value, and it's closer to what I need for the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, Bob can still get the product for $8,000 from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when a guaranteed lower price is available."
