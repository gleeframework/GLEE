Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still significantly less than what you would get from John. This allows for some negotiation room while ensuring you get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what you're aiming for. You have a backup option in John, and there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget.  While I can't go down to $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,000? This still leaves room for you to save money compared to its value, and it's closer to what I need for the sale."", ""product_price"": 9000}
