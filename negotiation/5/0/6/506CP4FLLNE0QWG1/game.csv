"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our discussion.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I see the value in the product, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $650,000. This price reflects my current assessment of the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $725,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable price for both parties.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $725,000 is still a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to go up to $700,000. This represents a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge this gap.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a new price of $750,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is a step closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $720,000. This reflects my sincere effort to find a middle ground, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",720000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $720,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a new price of $760,000.
