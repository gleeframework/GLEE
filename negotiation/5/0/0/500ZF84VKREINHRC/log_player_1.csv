Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A higher starting price gives you leverage in the negotiation.
* **Encourage negotiation:** A reasonable starting point makes it likely Bob will counteroffer.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** If negotiations with Bob fail, you still have a guaranteed buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This price is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and the fairness of the price, hoping to sway Bob towards accepting the offer.
* **Strategic advantage:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while leaving room for further adjustments depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,500 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. Could you consider $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired $10,000. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further reducing the price and could ultimately lead to a worse deal. 

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. It's the most logical and financially secure option at this point."
