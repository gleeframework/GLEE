Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we seem to be going back and forth here. I'm willing to compromise, but $10,500 is truly the most I can justify spending on this product. If you're unable to accept that, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price, and we're running out of time. Accepting his offer will ensure a sale and a decent profit. I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for more."
