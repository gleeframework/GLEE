"Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a much lower price.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we say $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise, but I think $7,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. To be honest, my absolute limit is $8,000. If you're able to do that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $8,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,
