"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a decent price. I'm not willing to go lower than $12,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm not willing to go lower than $12,000, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm not going to accept his offer right away. I'll see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is a bit of a compromise, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $13,500, which is closer to my initial offer than his previous offer.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than selling to John for $12,000. I'm going to accept his offer."
