"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Bob should reject the offer. He can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $8,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer to pay $8,500, Alice's offer of $9,000 is still a good deal for him. It's lower than what John is charging, and it's closer to his ideal price than Alice's initial offer."
