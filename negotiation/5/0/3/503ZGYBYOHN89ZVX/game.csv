"Alice, your product sounds great but $25000 is more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in purchasing, but I can only go up to $15000.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within a budget, Bob. However, I have to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $22000 for it. Can you consider that?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $22000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. Let's meet in the middle at $18500. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the sale.",18500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $20000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. Can you see your way to meeting me at $20000?",20000.0,Alice,5,
