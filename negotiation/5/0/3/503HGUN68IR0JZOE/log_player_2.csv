"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $10,000 is way above Bob's limit of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to get the product for as low as possible, but he still needs to be realistic.  He offers $7,500, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $9,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's budget of $8,000. While it's closer to his limit, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject this offer and try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $9,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to go to $8,500, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he still wants to save some money. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable counter-offer, as it's a significant drop from Alice's previous offer and  only $500 above Bob's maximum. It's a good compromise that shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also trying to be fair."
