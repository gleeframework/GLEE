"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $9,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
