Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without risking a rejection.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly below Bob's valuation allows room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 gives you leverage in the negotiation.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
