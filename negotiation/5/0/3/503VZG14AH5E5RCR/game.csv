Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. It's a game-changer in its industry and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. What do you think?,800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the industry standards. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $700000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm happy to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer $650000 for the product. This reflects a significant step towards your position, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $650000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $675000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs.
