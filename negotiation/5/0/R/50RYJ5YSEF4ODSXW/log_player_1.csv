Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting offer. It's above Bob's value of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a chance to earn more than the $120 John is offering.  It's also important to be positive and engaging to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $90 for the product. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum of $120, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about $95? That's a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution we're both happy with!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I'll stick to my original offer of $90. If you can't meet that, I'll consider buying the product elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has made it clear that he won't budge from his $90 offer. While I'm closer to my minimum of $120, it's not enough to make the deal worthwhile.  It's time to take the secure offer from John."
