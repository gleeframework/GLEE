Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible without going below your minimum ($12,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's no pressure to go below that price.
* **Psychology:** Offering a price slightly below a whole number like $12,000 might make Bob perceive it as a better deal. 

It's important to note that this is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, you might need to adjust your approach."
