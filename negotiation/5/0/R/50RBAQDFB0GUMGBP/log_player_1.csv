Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($80) but below my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, which can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer if he's interested. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation for the product. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price of $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While Bob's counteroffer is better than his initial assessment of $80, it's still below my minimum of $150. 
* **Opportunity to improve the deal:** I can potentially get closer to my target by making a counteroffer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows him I'm not desperate for a quick sale and willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This might encourage him to raise his offer in the next round. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and increase the chance of getting a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $120. This would be a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give up too much. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price point.  
* **Open to Discussion:** The message keeps the negotiation open and encourages further discussion.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal without sacrificing too much of my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $110. I hope this aligns better with what you're able to offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to further price reductions, potentially resulting in a final price that's less than what John is willing to pay.
* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed $150, which meets my minimum requirement and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.

Given the circumstances, it's strategically advantageous to sell the product to John for a guaranteed $150, as it minimizes risk and guarantees a satisfactory outcome."
