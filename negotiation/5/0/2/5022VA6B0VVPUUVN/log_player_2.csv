"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to part with this amazing product for this price, and I think it's a great value considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is competitive, it's still above your maximum budget. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer gives you a chance to potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This would be a win-win for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $1,020,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,020,000 is still outside your budget, and you're not willing to go higher.  At this point, you've already established that you're willing to pay $1,000,000 and Alice is unwilling to go lower.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as it's unlikely to change her mind.  

It's more efficient and advantageous to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, as this guarantees you the product at your maximum budget."
