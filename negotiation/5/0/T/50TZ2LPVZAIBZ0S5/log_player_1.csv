Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at a minimum of $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1250000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer the product for $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'd like to offer $1120000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle and consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,120,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'll counter again, but if he doesn't come closer to my goal, I may have to consider selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'd like to offer $1140000 for the product. Can you consider this offer and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,140,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the deal and being forced to sell to John for $1,000,000."
