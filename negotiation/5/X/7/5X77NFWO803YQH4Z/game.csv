"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  That's still a good price for a product worth so much to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9200.0,Bob,4,
