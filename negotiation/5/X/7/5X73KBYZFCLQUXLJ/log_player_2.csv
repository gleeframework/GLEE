"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a price of $11,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob time to attempt to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is aiming for a price as close to Alice's value of $10,000 as possible.  
* **Moderate Counter:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but not so drastic that it's likely to be instantly rejected. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Bob is leaving room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This feels like a fair deal considering the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still try to get a lower price. There are 7 rounds remaining, giving him time to negotiate further.
* **Moving towards goal:** Alice is moving closer to Bob's desired price point.  
* **Avoiding John:**  Buying from John at this point would be more expensive than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a little high, but I'm willing to go to $10,750. This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental approach:** Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product. 
* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is halfway between Bob's previous offer ($10,500) and Alice's current offer ($11,000).
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  There's still room to negotiate further if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $10,750 is a bit too low for me to consider. I could finalize the deal right now for $10,900. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to goal:** Alice's offer of $10,900 is very close to Bob's desired price range. 
* **Limited time:** There are only 5 rounds left. It's likely that further negotiation will result in a slightly lower price but might not be worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Avoid John:**  Buying from John at $12,000 would be significantly more expensive.

While Bob might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, accepting this offer is the most prudent choice considering the limited time and the potential for a better deal falling through."
