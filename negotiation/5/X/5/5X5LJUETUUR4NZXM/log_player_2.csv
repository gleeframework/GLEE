Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're narrowing down the price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is just $85,000 below Bob's maximum budget, and he's already had multiple rounds of negotiations.  With only 3 rounds remaining, the likelihood of getting a significantly better price is low.  It's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John at $1,200,000, saving him $85,000 compared to Alice's offer."
