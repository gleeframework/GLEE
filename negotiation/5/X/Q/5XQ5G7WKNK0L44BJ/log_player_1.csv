Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good incentive to accept. I'll see if he bites, and if not, we'll see what counteroffer he proposes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering my minimum value.  Hopefully, he sees that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to undervalue my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  He's not budging much, and I'm getting frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John and be done with this negotiation."
