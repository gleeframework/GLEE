Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. What do you think?,800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I think $700000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I'd like to buy the product for $700000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to accept $700000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. I'd like to propose a price of $725000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not willing to accept $725000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1000000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $775000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775000. I'd like to propose a price of $750000, as I mentioned earlier. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",750000.0,Bob,6,
