This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, while also ensuring I get a good deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1150000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident that $1125000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. This price allows for a good profit for you while remaining within my budget.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1125000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1175000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $1150000. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where it's more beneficial for me to explore other options. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1200000, which is still a compromise from my original price. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other buyers.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
