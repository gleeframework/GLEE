"Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Could you consider something closer to $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  While $10,000 is still less than I hoped for, I'm willing to accept $13,000 to close this deal quickly.  This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
