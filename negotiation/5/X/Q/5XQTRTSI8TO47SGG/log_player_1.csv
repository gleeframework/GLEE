Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob will receive by purchasing the product.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm willing to settle for $8,000 from John, but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with Bob. This offer gives me room to potentially come down a bit if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than desired:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still lower than what I'm hoping for.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can likely get a better price by countering Bob's offer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $8,000, I'm not afraid to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $10,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Re-emphasizing value:** I'm again highlighting the product's worth to Bob to justify my counteroffer.
* **Staying above minimum:** $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $8,000, ensuring I won't lose out if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500.  Would that be workable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:**  While $9,500 isn't my ideal price, it's only $500 away from my previous counteroffer of $10,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counter again, there's a risk that he might walk away, and I'd be stuck with John's lower offer.
* **Time is money:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the deal and secure a good profit without further negotiation."
