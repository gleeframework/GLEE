"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is a valuable asset. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. $9,500 is still a little too high for me. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer, considering I could always buy it from someone else for $8,000.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $8,500. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
