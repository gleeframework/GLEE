"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is a valuable asset. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. $9,500 is still a little too high for me. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer, considering I could always buy it from someone else for $8,000."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $8,500. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
