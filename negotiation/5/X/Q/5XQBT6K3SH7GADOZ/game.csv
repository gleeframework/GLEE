"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I believe that's a fair compromise and reflects the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $820,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle at $785,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",785000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $785,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $810,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",810000.0,Alice,7,
