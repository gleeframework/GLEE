**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $800,000 mark. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is getting smaller and it's getting riskier. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and I'd rather secure the deal at $810,000 than risk the negotiations breaking down and having to pay John $1,000,000."
