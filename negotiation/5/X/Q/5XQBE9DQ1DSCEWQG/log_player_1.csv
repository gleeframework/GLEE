Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999.  I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11999}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible, without going below your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a high but not unreasonable price leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere closer to his perceived value. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while securing a guaranteed sale at your minimum price."
