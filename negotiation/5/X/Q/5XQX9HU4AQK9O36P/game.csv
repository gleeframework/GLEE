"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your needs perfectly and comes with a satisfaction guarantee. I believe it's worth more than its value to you, which is $80. Would you like to purchase it for $95?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's features, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. How about if we settle on $90 for the product? I believe this is a fair compromise considering both our positions.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $87.50. I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground here. Considering our previous discussions, how does $88 sound for the product? It's a slight increase from your last offer, but still within a reasonable range for both of us.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're getting close.  However, $88 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $86? This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale.",86.0,Bob,6,
