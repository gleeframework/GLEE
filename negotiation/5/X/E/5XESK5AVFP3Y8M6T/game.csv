"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This represents a fair price that is within my financial limitations, and I believe it offers you a good return on your investment.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value that I believe you're undervaluing. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part while still reflecting the true worth of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair price considering the value I place on the product. I believe this offer allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
