"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me in the middle?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $112.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $112. Can you meet me at $108? That's my absolute max for this product.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $108 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me at $109? That's the best I can do.",109.0,Bob,6,
