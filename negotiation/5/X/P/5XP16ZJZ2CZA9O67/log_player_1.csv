Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering our shared goal of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
