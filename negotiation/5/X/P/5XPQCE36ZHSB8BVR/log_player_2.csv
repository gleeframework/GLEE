"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This is a no-brainer. Alice's offer is far above your maximum price. You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer helps establish your price range.  While it might seem aggressive, it leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $180 was my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is coming down, but $130 is still above your maximum price and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for moving on the price. I appreciate the effort.  How about we settle at $100? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counter-offer meets Alice halfway between her current offer ($130) and your previous offer ($80). It shows willingness to negotiate while still striving for a good deal. 
* **Below John's price:** Staying below $120 keeps the pressure on Alice, as you have a viable alternative.
* **Polite but firm:** The tone remains positive and appreciative but clearly communicates your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I can do $115, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $115 is below your maximum price and John's offer. While you could try to haggle further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and you risk losing the deal. This offer saves you $5 compared to John and is a reasonable compromise."
