"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You're willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000 at this point.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value is worth much more to you than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm determined to get the product for as close to $800,000 as possible.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really pushing the limits of my budget here, but I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $875,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's true value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still too high.  I'm determined to get the product for no more than $800,000, and there's no indication she's willing to go any lower. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer, which is the best option available at this point."
