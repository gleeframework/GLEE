"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you than that. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000 at this point.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value is worth much more to you than that. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really pushing the limits of my budget here, but I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's true value to you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
