""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair and mutually beneficial. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,000,000 leaves little room for negotiation and might scare Bob off.
* **Setting a Deadline:** The 24-hour deadline adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**The Strategy:**

This offer aims to strike a balance:

* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, offering him a potential gain of $75,000.
* **Highly Profitable for You:**  You secure a profit of $125,000, which is significantly more than your alternative offer from John.

This approach aims to secure a deal quickly with Bob while still maximizing your profit."
