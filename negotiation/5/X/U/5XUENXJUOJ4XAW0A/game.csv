"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $10,500?  That's a good middle ground, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. ",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great price for the product, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I'm happy to see the price coming down, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,750? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",10750.0,Bob,6,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,7,
