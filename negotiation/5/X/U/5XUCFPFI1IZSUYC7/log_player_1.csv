Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. How about a price of $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice should start with an offer higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than John's guaranteed offer ($120). This leaves room for negotiation or a quick sale.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (""a great deal"") makes the offer more appealing, even without specifics.
* **Leaving Room:** While $110 is closer to Alice's minimum, it allows for Bob to counter-offer if he's somewhat interested. 

**Important Note:** Alice needs to be prepared to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob negotiates. The goal is to maximize profit, and a slightly lower price is better than losing the sale altogether and selling to John for $120."
