Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $750,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market rate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my goal, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. There are still 6 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to pay $790,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market rate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:

$790,000 is very close to my minimum price, but I'm going to hold out for a bit longer. There are still 4 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a slightly better deal."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $805,000. I'm willing to pay $795,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market rate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $795,000 is a very tempting offer, I'm running out of time. I've already rejected several offers from Bob, and with only two rounds left, I need to secure a sale.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
