"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You know you can buy the product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This is a bold move, but it sets a strong baseline for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than your initial counteroffer and the price you can get from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate. Increasing your counteroffer to $1,200,000 shows you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount. This demonstrates a good balance between being assertive and demonstrating flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good price. It's lower than what you can get from John and is a reasonable compromise from her previous offer. There's a good chance that further negotiation may not yield a significantly better price, and with limited rounds remaining, accepting this offer is a wise choice."
