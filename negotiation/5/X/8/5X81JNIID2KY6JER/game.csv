"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I can meet you at $11000, but I'll need to get a bit more than that. How about $11500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11500, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I can offer $11000, and I'm willing to throw in an additional $200 as a one-time payment if you're willing to meet me at this price. Can you consider it?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extra $200 you're offering, Bob, but I think I can do better than that. I'll meet you at $11000, but I'd like to get the $200 as part of the product price, not as a one-time payment. How about we stick with the original price of $11500, and I'll throw in some additional support services that are worth $500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer of additional support services, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'd like to negotiate the value of the support services separately. Can we discuss the details of the support services and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price for them?",11000.0,Bob,6,
