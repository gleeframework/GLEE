"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product for $1,000,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price, especially since Alice is willing to sell for less than her own valuation.  We'll try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a more reasonable price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $920,000, but I need to be careful with my finances. Can we meet somewhere in the middle at $985,000?

You have three options:

Alice is getting closer to my price point, but $985,000 is still too high. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. However, I've also had another buyer, John, express interest in the product, and he's willing to pay the full $1,200,000. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to consider selling to him. Can you meet me at $990,000 to make it worth my while to sell to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000

Alice is clearly willing to go lower than $1,200,000, which is what John is offering.  At $990,000, I'm still getting a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing out to another buyer.  It's time to accept this offer."
