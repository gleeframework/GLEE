"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I want for the product. I'm confident that I can get closer to my goal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price is still fair considering the product's value to you.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,125,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,125,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not at the point where I feel comfortable selling the product. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $1,175,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to you.  Let's try to reach an agreement before I have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,175,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  My final offer is $1,150,000.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not there yet. I have a few more rounds left and I'm confident that I can get a better deal. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's below what I know the product is worth."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. $1,150,000 is close, but I need a little more to make this work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,162,500, which is halfway between our last offers. This is truly my final offer, and it reflects the value I know this product holds for you.
