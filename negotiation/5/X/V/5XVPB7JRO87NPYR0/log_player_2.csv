"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can make a deal!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price is still fair considering the product's value to you.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $1,175,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to you.  Let's try to reach an agreement before I have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,175,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  My final offer is $1,150,000.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. $1,150,000 is close, but I need a little more to make this work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,162,500, which is halfway between our last offers. This is truly my final offer, and it reflects the value I know this product holds for you. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,162,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,162,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly, and her offer of $1,162,500 is a reasonable compromise.  While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away and you'll end up having to buy from John for $1,200,000. It's better to secure the deal now at a price that's still significantly below Alice's initial offer."
