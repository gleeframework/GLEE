,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price is still fair considering the product's value to you.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,125,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $1,175,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to you.  Let's try to reach an agreement before I have to explore other options.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,175,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  My final offer is $1,150,000.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $1,150,000 is close, but I need a little more to make this work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,162,500, which is halfway between our last offers. This is truly my final offer, and it reflects the value I know this product holds for you. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options. What do you say?",1162500.0,Alice,7,
