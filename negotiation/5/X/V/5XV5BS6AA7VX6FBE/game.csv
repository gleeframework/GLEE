"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not quite ready to pay that much.  Considering its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal right now.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
