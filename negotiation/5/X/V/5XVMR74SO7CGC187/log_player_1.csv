Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $900,000. The product is valuable to me, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still gives you a significant savings compared to the value it holds for you. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  We've already established that the product is worth more to Bob than that. I'll counter again, hoping to get closer to my target price."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, this is our final offer.  $930,000 is a fair price, considering the value you'll receive from this product. If you're serious about making this deal, this is your last chance. If not, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 930000}

Round 10
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  I've reached my final round of negotiation with Bob, and he's still not willing to meet me at a price that's acceptable. While I'd prefer to make more, selling to John is the best option at this point, as it's still better than accepting Bob's offer."
