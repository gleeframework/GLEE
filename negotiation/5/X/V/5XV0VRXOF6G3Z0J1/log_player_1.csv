# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think!

Round 6

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're running out of time, but I'm still not comfortable with $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer is too low and we're running out of time. I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure a sale with John and avoid risking a complete loss."
