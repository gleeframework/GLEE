"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know what you think!",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $14000 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $15500 as a final compromise. This is a great price for a product with the value I'm offering.  If you're serious about buying it, let's close the deal. ",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14750. I'm getting close to my limit, but I really like the product. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",14750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here, but I still believe my product is worth more than $14750.  I'm willing to come down to $15000 as my final offer.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. If you're serious about buying it, let's close the deal now.",15000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're running out of time, but I'm still not comfortable with $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",14250.0,Bob,8,
