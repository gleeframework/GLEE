Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly lower than what the product is worth to me. This leaves room for negotiation and doesn't immediately scare Bob off.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation. This makes it more appealing to Bob and sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  The $900,000 offer leaves a $100,000 buffer, allowing for potential counteroffers without significantly compromising my target profit. 
* **Plan B:**  Remember, I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum asking price of $1,000,000. This gives me leverage and limits my potential loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the potential profit I'll make from it. Would you be willing to meet me at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting this would mean a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I still have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum. This gives me the leverage to push for a better price from Bob.
* **Counteroffer Potential:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that bridges the gap and potentially reaches a mutually acceptable price.

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of the product to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This leaves us both with a comfortable profit margin.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Maintaining Value:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not sacrificing too much value. This price still allows me to earn a decent profit and demonstrates that I'm serious about selling to Bob. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and emphasizes the potential for a win-win situation, keeping the negotiation amicable.
* **John is My Safety Net:** I can still sell to John for $1,000,000 if this negotiation fails, which gives me the confidence to hold firm on a price that's closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a more substantial offer. I'm thinking of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential profit I'll make from it. Would you be willing to meet me at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** The gap between our offers is substantial, and it seems unlikely that Bob will budge much further. Continuing to negotiate would likely lead to further rounds of counteroffers, consuming time and energy without guaranteeing a favorable outcome.
* **Secure Profit:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my desired profit. It's a safe and straightforward option that eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations.

It's important to prioritize my financial goals and minimize risk. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed outcome and prevents potential losses in continued negotiations with Bob."
