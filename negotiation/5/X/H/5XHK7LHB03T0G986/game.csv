"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the potential profit I'll make from it. Would you be willing to meet me at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of the product to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This leaves us both with a comfortable profit margin.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
