Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've started with a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've kept the message friendly and focused on the potential value of the product to Bob. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Starting high:** By starting at $900,000, I leave space for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Positive framing:** Highlighting the value to Bob creates a more favorable negotiation environment.
* **Flexibility:** This approach allows me to adapt based on Bob's response, potentially accepting a counteroffer or making a new one.
* **Backup option:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage and a clear stopping point if negotiations become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for that low of a price yet.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer. This will allow me to try and find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've countered with $850,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still protects my interests.
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Bob's offer while reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing the fairness of my counteroffer.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Compromise:** Demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while not giving away too much.
* **Reasonable counter:**  $850,000 is a more realistic price point that Bob might be willing to accept.
* **Positive framing:** Again, focusing on fairness and value helps create a more positive negotiation atmosphere.

By offering this counteroffer, I aim to keep the negotiations moving forward while still ensuring I receive a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $850,000, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $825,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I would have preferred to get closer to $900,000, it's important to recognize that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a prolonged process.  

Given that I have a backup option of selling to John for $1,000,000, accepting Bob's offer is a good compromise. It allows me to secure a sale and avoid potentially losing out on a better deal by prolonging the negotiation."
