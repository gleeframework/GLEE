"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, given my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm prepared to offer $95, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's get this deal done.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $110 was still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $105. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Alice,5,
