# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than the first round, $900,000 is still above his budget.  He should counter with a lower offer and see if he can get closer to his target price."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000.  Alice has been unwilling to come down to Bob's target price, and it's unlikely she'll budge further.  This is a better deal than Alice is offering, and it avoids risking further negotiation rounds."
