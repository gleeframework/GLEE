"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $85?  That's the highest I can go right now.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $95?  I'm really serious about getting this product, and this is the most I can offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a fair price that still reflects its value, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",105.0,Alice,5,
