"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can offer you a compromise at $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a compromise for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a slight discount at $10,500. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,5,
