"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $11,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $12,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $12,750 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably spend. Let's split the difference. I'm offering you $12,000 for the product. This would be a fair price that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,500. This is my minimum acceptable price, considering the value the product brings to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
