You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is misleading. While she claims the product holds a value of $120 for me, her offer is actually $140. It makes more sense to purchase the product from John at the lower price of $120 and avoid Alice's inflated offer."
