"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is too high ($15,000) and exceeds Bob's budget of $12,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $12,000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than Bob's budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's budget of $12,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000, as there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and Bob has limited rounds left."
