"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $800,000.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit too high for me.  How about we bring it down closer to market value?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential benefits.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway there, Alice.  While that price is getting closer, I think we still have some ground to cover before we reach a deal. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I still think the product's value is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential benefits and the effort I've put into developing it.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right about the product's potential, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Let's make this simple - $625,000.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a fair compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $625,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $675,000. This is the best price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",675000.0,Alice,7,
