Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than your minimum ($150) allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher if he's very interested. 
* **Guaranteed Backup:** You have the security of John as a buyer at $150, so you're not pressured to go below your minimum."
