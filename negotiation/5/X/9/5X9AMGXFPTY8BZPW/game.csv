"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering our initial discussions. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but the price of $950,000 is significantly below what I consider its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.
