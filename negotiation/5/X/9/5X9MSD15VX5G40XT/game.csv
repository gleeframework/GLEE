"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but that's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $10,500? It's closer to your offer, and it gives us both something to work with.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can we meet in the middle again?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,500 is still too far from what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,250. It's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet at this price.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment and willingness to negotiate. $9,250 is still a bit below where I need to be, but I'm ready to make one final compromise.  How about $9,750? This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want. Let's close this deal.",9750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. It's a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this point.",9200.0,Bob,8,
