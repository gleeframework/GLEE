"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to build rapport.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering $12,000, I leave room for negotiation without immediately going to my ""John"" fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While it's a good sign that he's interested, $9,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** Bob's willingness to negotiate shows he's interested and we can potentially reach a middle ground.
* **Time for a counteroffer:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but that's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $10,500? It's closer to your offer, and it gives us both something to work with."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:** I'm counteroffering with $10,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Show flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, making it clear that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone and encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's a good sign he's coming up, $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would be a loss.
* **More negotiation is possible.**  Bob's continued offers show he's genuinely interested, and there's a possibility we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Time for another counteroffer.**  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, as I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,500 is still too far from what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and meet halfway:**  I'm offering $10,000, which is halfway between my last offer and Bob's. This demonstrates a willingness to find a solution.
* **Highlight the compromise:**  I emphasize the compromise to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive and focused on a deal:**  I maintain a positive tone and focus on reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,250. It's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's getting closer to my minimum, $9,250 is still a significant loss for me.
* **We're getting close to a deal.**  Bob's offer shows he's serious about buying and we're close to a point where a compromise might be possible.
* **Time for another counteroffer.**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment and willingness to negotiate. $9,250 is still a bit below where I need to be, but I'm ready to make one final compromise.  How about $9,750? This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's a little closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm highlighting the fact that this price is fair for both of us.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I'm using phrases like ""final compromise"" and ""let's close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  While it's closer to my minimum, $9,750 still ensures I don't sell at a significant loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. It's a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the limit:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's not much room for further compromise.
* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While he's stating he's willing to walk away, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Guarantee a better price:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is higher than any price I'm likely to get from Bob at this point.
* **Minimize risk:**  While continuing negotiations might lead to a higher price, there's also a risk that we won't reach an agreement and I'll end up with nothing. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed sale."
