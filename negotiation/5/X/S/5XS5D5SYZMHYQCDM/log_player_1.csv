Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's my offer, aiming to secure a good deal without scaring Bob away:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. It holds significant value, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $1,400,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer, but this price point represents a strong balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
