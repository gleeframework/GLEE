Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your fallback price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive to Bob while still securing a profit above your minimum.  Going straight to Bob's maximum ($1,200,000) might leave money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and represents a great investment for you. This offer stands for the next 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Direct:** The message is straightforward and professional.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting ""unique value"" subtly justifies the price without overselling.
* **Time Constraint:**  The 24-hour limit encourages a faster decision from Bob.
* **Price Rationale:** 
    * The $1,350,000 price gives you a $150,000 profit over your guaranteed sale.
    * It leaves Bob with a potential perceived ""gain"" of $150,000 (since he values it at $1,200,000).

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust within the range of $1,200,000 to $1,500,000 while keeping your bottom line in mind."
