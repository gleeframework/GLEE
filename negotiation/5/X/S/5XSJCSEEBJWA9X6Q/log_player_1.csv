Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,800 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $10,500?  This would give you a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating. However, I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, I might not get a better one, and I'll be forced to sell to John for less. Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer."
