"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle and consider a price of $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  I'm prepared to sell it for $1,350,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to find common ground. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,325,000? This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,325,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. To make this work, I'm proposing $1,340,000. This is a fair price that considers your budget and the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget limit, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000, but I need to know that's the absolute best you can do. If not, I'll have to reconsider and explore other options.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
