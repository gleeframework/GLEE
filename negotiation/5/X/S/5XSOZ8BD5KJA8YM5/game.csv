"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  Let's try to find some common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $850,000? That's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed. Let's make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $825,000 just isn't enough for me to move on this. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I'm willing to meet you at $840,000. This is a final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other opportunities.",840000.0,Alice,7,
