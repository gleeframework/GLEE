"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, at $1,200,000, knowing it's above Bob's estimated value. This creates room for negotiation and puts pressure on him to make a counteroffer. However, I'm leaving the door open for a quick deal by mentioning the value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to offer $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  Let's try to find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'm also emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to come up on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$750,000 is still too low, even though it's closer to my bottom line. I'm going to try to get closer to $900,000 before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $850,000? That's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $850,000, which is closer to Bob's offer. I'm also reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing the need for a deal. This shows that I'm serious about selling to him, but I still want a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to go up slightly to $825,000.  This is a fair offer considering my budget limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $825,000 is getting closer, I'm still not happy with that price. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher before I consider selling to John. I'm going to counteroffer one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $825,000 just isn't enough for me to move on this. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I'm willing to meet you at $840,000. This is a final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other opportunities."", ""product_price"": 840000}
```

I'm putting a bit more pressure on Bob by calling this my ""final offer"".  I'm also trying to appeal to his sense of urgency by mentioning other opportunities. I'm hoping this will push him to accept my offer."
