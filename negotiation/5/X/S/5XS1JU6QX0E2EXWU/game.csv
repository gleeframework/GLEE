"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. ",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $78?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $81? This way we can both be happy with the deal. ",81.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go as low as $76?,76.0,Bob,6,
