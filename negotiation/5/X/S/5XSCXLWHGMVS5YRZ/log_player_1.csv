Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $145. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a profit if he accepts the initial price. 
* **Alternative Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so there's no pressure to go below our minimum. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring we don't lose the guaranteed sale to John."
