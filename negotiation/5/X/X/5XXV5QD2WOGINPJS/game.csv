"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,075,000 is a significant sum, the true value of this product is far greater.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This is my final offer in this range, as I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you believe the product has great value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from your original offer. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  $1,100,000 is my absolute lowest price. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. It reflects a significant discount while still recognizing the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
