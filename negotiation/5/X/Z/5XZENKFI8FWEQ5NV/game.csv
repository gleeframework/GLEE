"Alice, while I see the potential of this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm prepared to pay up to $800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price given my assessment of the product's value. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a considerable concession, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects a genuine desire to reach an agreement. Let's find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to increase your offer is encouraging.  To meet you halfway, I propose a price of $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept while still reflecting the product's true worth.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
