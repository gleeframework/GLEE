Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the potential of this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm prepared to pay up to $800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price given my assessment of the product's value. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a considerable concession, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects a genuine desire to reach an agreement. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:** Bob is now showing more willingness to move, and his offer is getting closer to our minimum. We're not there yet, but continued negotiation is the best path to maximize profit."
