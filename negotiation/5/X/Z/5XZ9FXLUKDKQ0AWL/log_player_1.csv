"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $10,000 to both of us.  It gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $11,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves me with a profit. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  There's a chance I can get a better price, and it's too early to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm dropping my price to $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, showing Bob I'm serious about making a deal.  I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually acceptable price without resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is very close to my minimum, I'm not going to give up yet. It's still possible that Bob might be willing to pay a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

I'm making one last attempt to get a price closer to my desired amount.  $10,200 is still a decent profit for me, and I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,900 is very close to my minimum, I've only got two rounds left and there's no guarantee he'll increase his offer further.  To avoid the risk of ending up with less than I'm willing to accept, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
