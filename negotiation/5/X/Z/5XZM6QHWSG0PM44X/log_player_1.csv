Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation to reach a price that is closer to the $15,000 value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the condition of the product. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired value. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're interested. $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
