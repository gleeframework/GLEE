"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering a product that could be incredibly valuable to you, potentially exceeding even its intrinsic worth. I'm asking for $1500000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who will happily pay $1000000. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
