,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $80 is simply too low. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go that low. How about $120? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $120 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you be willing to do $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $95 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $110.  It's a fair price that ensures we both get a good deal. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
