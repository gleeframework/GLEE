{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price above Bob's perceived value but is still below your minimum. It leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident Bob will make a counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's important to stick to my minimum and try to negotiate a more reasonable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $80 is simply too low. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go that low. How about $120? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This counteroffer is closer to Bob's perceived value while still staying above my minimum.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give the product away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $120 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you be willing to do $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired goal.  I'm confident I can get a higher price, especially considering John is willing to pay $150.  I'll try to negotiate a bit higher with Bob before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $95 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $110.  It's a fair price that ensures we both get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm trying to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, while still maximizing my profit. $110 is a good compromise, offering a decent profit for me while being closer to Bob's perceived value."
