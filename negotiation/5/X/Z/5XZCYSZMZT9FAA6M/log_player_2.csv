"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs and exceed your expectations. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth every penny of the $10,000 you're willing to pay. However, to ensure a fair transaction, I propose a price of $9,500 for this exceptional item. This offer includes a comprehensive warranty and a personalized setup service to ensure you get the most out of your investment. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or if there's anything else we can assist you with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer, but still above your maximum price point.**  You are willing to pay $10,000, and Alice is asking $9,500. 
* **You want to save as much money as possible.** Since you have another option (John), rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better price with her or explore other options."
