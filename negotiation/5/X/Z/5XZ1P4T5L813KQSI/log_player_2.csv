"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $600,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. It's too early to buy from John, as I haven't even explored Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and  indicates my belief that the product's value is lower than her initial offer. I'm aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate and see if she's flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is moving closer to my desired price, but I believe I can still push for a lower price. There's no urgency to buy from John yet, as Alice is clearly willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but still keeping it below Alice's offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground and gauge how close we are to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While I'd prefer a lower price, accepting her offer saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. The negotiation has reached a point where further rounds might not result in a substantially lower price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
