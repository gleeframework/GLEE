Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering it slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($150) increases the chances he'll accept while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a backup buyer (John) at $80, so there's a safety net if Bob declines.

By starting high, you leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
