,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $75? I'm confident you'll still get a great value at that price.",75.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $72.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $74. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",74.0,Alice,5,
