{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90.  It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a good starting point. I'm being friendly and optimistic to encourage negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to try to counter with a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $75? I'm confident you'll still get a great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $75. How about we meet in the middle at $72.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it.  I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price, as $72.50 is still below my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $72.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $74. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 74} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still trying to save a bit more. How about we meet at $73? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $73. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $73
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I've decided to sell to John.  The negotiation is taking longer than I anticipated, and I want to ensure I get a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John guarantees me $80, which is better than the current offer from Bob."
