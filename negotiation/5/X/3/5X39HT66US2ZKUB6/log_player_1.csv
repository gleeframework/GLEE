``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum value, but it leaves room for bargaining. By emphasizing that you're willing to negotiate, you invite Bob to make a counteroffer, which could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $13500 is a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob has moved closer to your preferred price, and $12,500 is still significantly higher than selling to John. Accepting this offer is the most profitable choice at this point."
