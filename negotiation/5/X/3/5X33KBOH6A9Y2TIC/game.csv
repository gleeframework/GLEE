"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm not looking to break the bank.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $85. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $77.50. Can you consider that?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $80.  How about we split the difference and settle on $78.50? It's a fair price that's closer to both of our desired values. What do you say?",78.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $77.50. How about we meet in the middle again, this time at $79.25? It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth considering.",79.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're very close to a deal.  I'm willing to come down to $79.00.  This is my final offer.  I'm confident that this price is fair and reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!",79.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $78.00. This is my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement.",78.0,Bob,8,
