Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good deal considering the product is worth $10,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what I'd get from John, it's still lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price and closer to my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price that could be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $8,750 is only $250 less than my last counteroffer and significantly more than what I'd get from John. It's time to accept and close the deal."
