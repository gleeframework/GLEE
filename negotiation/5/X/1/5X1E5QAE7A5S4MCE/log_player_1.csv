Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Guarantee a Good Deal:** Even if Bob tries to negotiate down, it's unlikely they'll go below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (which you'll get from John).

This strategy balances ambition with a safety net, giving you the best chance of securing a high sale price."
