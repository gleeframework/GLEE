"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good price for you, and it's closer to my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $10,750. Can you consider this price?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good price, but $10,750 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,875? It's a fair price that's closer to both of our offers. What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but no more. Can you meet me at this price?",10750.0,Bob,6,
