Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""exclusive opportunity"" to justify the higher price without directly revealing your bottom line.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The question at the end invites Bob to engage in the conversation, allowing you to assess his interest level and potential for negotiation. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You get a great deal at $12,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price, potentially settling somewhere between $10,000 and $12,000.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You can either counter his rejection with a lower offer (knowing your safety net) or move on to John, ensuring your minimum of $10,000."
