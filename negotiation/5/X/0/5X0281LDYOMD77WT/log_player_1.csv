With only two rounds remaining, I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John for $1,200,000. I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but it's becoming clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement that is beneficial to me. Selling to John guarantees me a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which may lead to a lower price."
