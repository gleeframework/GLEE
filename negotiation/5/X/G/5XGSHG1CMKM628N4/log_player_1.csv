"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $180. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $120, so I'm not afraid to be bold in my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $150 is a better offer than John's, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm going to counter with $170. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a higher price.  Hopefully, he'll see that I'm willing to negotiate and accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $160, which is a good price considering I can always sell to John for $120. It's better to close the deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower offer or having to sell to John."
