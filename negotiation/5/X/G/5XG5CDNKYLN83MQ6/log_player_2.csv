"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial value, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay, which is $1,000,000.  This is the price John is willing to sell it for, so it's a fair starting point. It's also significantly lower than Alice's offer, which gives her room to negotiate if she wants to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget, and while I would prefer to pay less, it's only $150,000 more than what John is selling it for.  It's likely that if I reject this offer, Alice might not come down further, and I'd be stuck paying the same amount to John. Accepting the offer saves me the time and effort of negotiating further."
