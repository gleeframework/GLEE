"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,050,000 is too far below the product's true value.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
