"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,050,000 is too far below the product's true value.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much as possible.  $1,100,000 is a good price, but he can still potentially get it lower.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,075,000?  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both determined to find a solution.  Let's try $1,090,000.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price.  However, he's still only $20,000 away from his ideal price of $1,075,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if he can get Alice to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,090,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,080,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm ready to make a final concession.  Let's settle on $1,085,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finally close this deal.  I believe it's in both our best interests to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,085,000, which is only $5,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $1,080,000.  There are only a few rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will come down further.  Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer. It's a good deal, and Bob should take it."
