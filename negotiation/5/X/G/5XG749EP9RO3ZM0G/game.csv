"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe its true value might be even higher for the right buyer.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it for $1000000. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
