Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $90 is more than your minimum of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $100, so there's room for you to negotiate upwards if he's willing.
* **It's a fair offer:**  While you're aiming for a good price, you're also trying to build a positive relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and would like to make a counteroffer of $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price. It's worth risking a rejection to make another counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $87. Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 87}
