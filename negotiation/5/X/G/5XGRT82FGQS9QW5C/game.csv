"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 was a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $7,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $7,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but $6,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $7,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I'm confident you'll find the product's value is worth this price.",7000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer you $6,700 as my final price. If that doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately need to consider other options.",6700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a deal, but $6,700 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll counteroffer at $7,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the product.",7200.0,Alice,7,
