Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $300,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,000 (your minimum) and $1,500,000 (Bob's maximum).  Any price within this range can be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that $300,000 potential profit as possible.  However, being too greedy could lead Bob to reject your offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I've carefully considered its value and believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects its potential. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're aiming high but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're implying careful consideration of the product's value.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is your only other option) creates a sense of scarcity and encourages a quicker decision.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go.
* **Relationship:**  Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. If a future relationship is important, you might be slightly more flexible."
