"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm interested in the product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still out of my budget. I'm really keen on this product, but I need to stay within my price limit.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns about staying within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I can go. I'm really interested in this product and I believe a price of $1,075,000 would be fair for both of us. This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget while still providing you with a good return.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I understand your need to get a good price, but I'm confident this product is worth a lot to me.
