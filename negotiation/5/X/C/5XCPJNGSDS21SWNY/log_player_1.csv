Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130.  This is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but I'm hoping to get a good deal since it's worth more to me. I'll be ready to negotiate if he rejects my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $125. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to what I'm hoping to get. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to meet me halfway, and I've already made a concession. While $115 is still more than what John is offering, I'm not comfortable going any lower.  It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
