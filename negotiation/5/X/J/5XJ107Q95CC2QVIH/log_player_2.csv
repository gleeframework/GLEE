"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay. I should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows my willingness to negotiate, but also sets a clear lower bound for what I'm willing to pay. I'm aiming for a price that is still significantly lower than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. Rejecting her offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to my $800,000 counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round to show that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm staying below Alice's latest offer, demonstrating that I'm still focused on getting a good deal. This should hopefully encourage Alice to come down further in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my target price of $800,000.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting my offer and going back to her previous price or even increasing it again is high.  Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
