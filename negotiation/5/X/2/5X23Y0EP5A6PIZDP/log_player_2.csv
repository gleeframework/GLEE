# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $5,000 for the item. To provide some flexibility, I am willing to consider an offer closer to my valuation. How about we aim for a midpoint between my initial asking price and your offer? Would $7,000 be within your budget?
