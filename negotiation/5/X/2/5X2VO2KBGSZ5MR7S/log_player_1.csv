"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a very competitive price considering its true worth and potential return on investment. "",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while allowing for a reasonable profit for you. I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more. We're still significantly below John's offer, so there's room to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm matching John's offer in this round. This puts the pressure on Bob while ensuring I don't lose money if he walks away. It's a strong negotiating tactic at this stage."
