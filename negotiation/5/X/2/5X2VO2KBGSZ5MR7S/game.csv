"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a very competitive price considering its true worth and potential return on investment. ",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while allowing for a reasonable profit for you. I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
