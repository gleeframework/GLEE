"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $6500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6500 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a fair price for you, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $7200 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $7200 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $7600?  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",7600.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the compromise, but $7600 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",7000.0,Bob,6,
