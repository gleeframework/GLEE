{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

This is a starting point.  Here's why I chose this offer:

* **Higher than minimum:** It's above my minimum of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable:** It's not an outrageous price, making it more likely Bob will consider it.
* **Open-ended:** The message invites Bob to engage in a conversation, rather than simply giving a hard number. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $6500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $6,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by counteroffering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,500 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $8,500, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm also trying to keep the conversation positive by mentioning finding common ground.  Let's see if this is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $8500 is a fair price for you, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $7200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,200 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $7,200 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $7,600?  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 7600} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $7600 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is just too far below my minimum.  While I'd like to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go that low. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000."
