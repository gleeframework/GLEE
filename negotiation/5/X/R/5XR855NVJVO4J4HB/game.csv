"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a little high. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for in the market.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,000,000 seems like a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're serious about this, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on my desired price. I can do $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
