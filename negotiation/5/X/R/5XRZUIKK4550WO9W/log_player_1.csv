Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $10,000 to me, and Bob's offer of $8,000 is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $8,500. Would that work for you?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this negotiation. $9,000 is getting close, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $8,500. Would you be willing to come down a little bit more? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and while we're getting closer, we're still not at a price I'm comfortable with.  Rather than continue to go back and forth, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
