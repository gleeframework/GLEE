Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $125. I think it's a great deal and you'll really find value in it."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $150 as possible, but I need to offer Bob a price that's enticing.
* **Potential Loss:** If I ask for too much, Bob will reject the offer, and I'll only get $150 from John. 
* **Finding a Balance:** $125 is a price point that could be attractive to Bob (as it's more than his perceived value) while still giving me a significant profit margin."
