Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $12,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high but believable anchor:** By stating you believe it's worth ""at least"" $12,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the value at that price. Offering it for $14,000 is a significant markup but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** Mentioning that you're offering it to him before a public listing implies that he might miss out if he doesn't act now.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While your goal is to maximize profit, starting too high could scare Bob away. This offer allows for some back and forth, potentially landing you a price higher than $12,000.

**Important:** If Bob counters with a price too low, remember your fallback option (John) ensures you won't lose money."
