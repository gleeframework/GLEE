Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his current offer.  While he sees the value in the product, he's clearly price-sensitive.  Accepting his offer of $775,000 would mean losing out on the guaranteed $800,000 from John. At this point, the risk of Bob walking away is outweighed by the sure profit from John."
