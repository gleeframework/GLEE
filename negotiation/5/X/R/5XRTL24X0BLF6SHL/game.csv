"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its potential worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $875,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $825,000? That's my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm sticking to my budget on this one.  If you're willing to come down to $775,000, we have a deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,
