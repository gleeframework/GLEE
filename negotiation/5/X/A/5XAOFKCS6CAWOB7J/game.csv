"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work.  This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000,  which is a significant concession on my part.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
