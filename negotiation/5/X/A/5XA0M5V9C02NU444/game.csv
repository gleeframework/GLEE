"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
