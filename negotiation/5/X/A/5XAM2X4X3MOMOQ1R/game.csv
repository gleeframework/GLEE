"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I do see its potential. However, $11500 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10500, which is still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, thanks for coming down to $11000.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but I'm still a bit off. How about we split the difference and settle on $10750?  That way we both get a good deal, and I can finalize the purchase.",10750.0,Bob,4,
