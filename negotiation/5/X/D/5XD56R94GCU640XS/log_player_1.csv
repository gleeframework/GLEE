{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit.
* **Message:** I'm focusing on the value the product offers Bob, aiming to build a positive rapport while emphasizing the fairness of the offer. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** The starting price is closer to my desired outcome.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I can adjust the price down if needed,  but I'm not starting at a low point.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** If negotiations fail, I can still secure my minimum price by selling to John."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is my absolute maximum. Can we make a deal at this price?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to try and squeeze out a few more dollars, the negotiation has gone on long enough. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
