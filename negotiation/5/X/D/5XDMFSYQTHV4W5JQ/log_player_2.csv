"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really like it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $10,000 is still over my budget. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I think $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still holding out for a price higher than my maximum budget. While her offer has come down from $12,000, it's still too high. With five rounds remaining, it's unlikely we'll find a price we both agree on. It's better for me to buy the product from John for $8,000 and secure the deal."
