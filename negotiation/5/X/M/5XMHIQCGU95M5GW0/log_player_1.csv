{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product description] and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $200, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product, making Bob more likely to consider your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That [product description] sounds great.  I'm really interested, but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $150?  I'm serious about buying this, and that's my absolute top price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is your minimum, but there's no guarantee that you can get a better price in further rounds.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price and saves time."
