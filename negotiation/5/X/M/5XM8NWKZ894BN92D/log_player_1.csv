Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,000,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000, giving you a good profit margin.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer is still below Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, giving him incentive to negotiate and potentially reach a deal where both of you are happy.
* **It allows for a counteroffer:**  By setting a price that leaves room for negotiation, you can potentially secure a higher price through counteroffers.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping Bob interested in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below your ideal price point, but it's closer to your minimum.  By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer that may push the price even higher and secure a better deal for yourself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:** This offer keeps the price higher than Bob's offer but not so high that it makes him walk away entirely. 
* **Setting a clear target:** It establishes a price point that you are willing to accept, putting the pressure on Bob to make the final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still a bit lower than your ideal price, it's close to it and within a reasonable range.  Considering the potential risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob walking away, accepting this offer seems like the best option at this point.  You can secure a good profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
