{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than Bob's valuation, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also provides a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value and I'm confident I can secure a similar price with John if I reject this offer."
