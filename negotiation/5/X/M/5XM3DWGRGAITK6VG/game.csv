"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $900,000?  This gives you a significant discount, while still allowing me to achieve a fair price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but $870,000 is still a bit low for me. How about $890,000? This is a compromise that's closer to my desired price while still giving you a substantial discount. Let's make this deal happen!",890000.0,Alice,5,
