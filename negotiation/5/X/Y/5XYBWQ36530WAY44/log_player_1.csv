Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $11,000 is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, I still believe I can get more.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  It's a fair price considering the value to you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $11,100.  It's a fair price that's closer to what I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $11,100. While it's still a bit lower than my initial goal,  it's a good deal considering the remaining rounds.  It's also closer to my minimum price, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a significantly better offer in the remaining rounds."
