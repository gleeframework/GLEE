Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  This price would still allow you to make a significant profit, while keeping the deal within my spending limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a good compromise. This price would still allow you to make a profit and would be a more comfortable price point for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
