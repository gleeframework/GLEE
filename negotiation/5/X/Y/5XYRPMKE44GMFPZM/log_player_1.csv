Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the message in a way that encourages Bob to consider the offer and builds a positive rapport.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer, showing flexibility. 

**Note:** This is just a starting point.  I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $12000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Room for Improvement:**  There's no realistic chance of getting a better price from Bob, given his counter-offer.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing negotiations risks delaying a sale, and I can't guarantee a better offer from Bob.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at my minimum price and avoid further negotiation."
