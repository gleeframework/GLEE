Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my valuation.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Just Below Guarantee:** The price is slightly below my guaranteed sale price, creating a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob. 

**It's important to note:** This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit. If my primary goal was a quick and guaranteed sale, I would offer the product to Bob at $15,000."
