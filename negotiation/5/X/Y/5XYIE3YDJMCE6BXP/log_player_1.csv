"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially securing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $875,000. It's a compromise, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm aiming to meet halfway, hoping Bob will see the value in finalizing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's a good price, and while I'd love to push for more, we're already at round 4.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, and John is always a backup option."
