"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm offering $850,000 for the product. This is a good compromise for both of us and ensures we can close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering $825,000 for the product. This is a good compromise for both of us and ensures we can close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
