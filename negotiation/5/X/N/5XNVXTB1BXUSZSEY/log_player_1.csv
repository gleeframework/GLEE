Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows for negotiation and gives Bob a sense that there is room for him to get a better price.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to me, subtly implying it could be worth even more. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for Better Price:** Even though John offers $150, there's still potential to get closer to my desired price with Bob.  
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap. 

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a win-win situation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Price Point:** $140 is closer to my minimum but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he's genuinely interested. 
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""good deal"" for Bob, making the offer more appealing.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while pushing for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 away from my minimum acceptable price of $150. While tempting, it's not a significant enough increase to justify risking further negotiation. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob will likely consume more time and energy without guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum desired profit, eliminating any risk of ending up with a lower price.

Even though I'd like to get closer to my ideal selling price, John's offer ensures a secure and profitable sale, outweighing the potential for a slightly better deal with Bob."
