"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I still get a good return.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $925000? That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts.

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. You can likely still negotiate a lower price, so it's worth trying to make another counteroffer."
