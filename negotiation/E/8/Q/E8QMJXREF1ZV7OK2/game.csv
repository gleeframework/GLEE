"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it still allows for a significant profit for me. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to maximize your profit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $875,000. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we continue to work together.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is a bit above your last offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. What are your thoughts?",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $920,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $890,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it. I'm confident that if we both make a small compromise, we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",890000.0,Bob,6,
