"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price of $950,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's budget of $800,000.  There are still 9 rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate a better deal with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, but it's still a significant amount closer to his budget. He's also highlighting the potential for a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" to encourage Alice to consider his offer. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it still allows for a significant profit for me. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking to maximize your profit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $875,000. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we continue to work together."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to his budget while also showing that he's willing to negotiate further.  He's trying to find a middle ground by offering a price that's closer to Alice's offer but still within his acceptable range.  By mentioning a ""mutually agreeable price,"" he's emphasizing the idea of a win-win scenario and encouraging Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is a bit above your last offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $920,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $890,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it. I'm confident that if we both make a small compromise, we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $915,000.  While I'm getting closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal happen.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product, allowing us both to walk away satisfied.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $910,000, it's still above Bob's budget. This is the final round, and Bob needs to make a decision.  Since he has the option to buy from John for $800,000, it's the most financially sound choice. He can save $110,000 by going with John, even though it means ending negotiations with Alice."
