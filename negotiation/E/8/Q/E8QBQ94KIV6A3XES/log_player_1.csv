Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher asking price from Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and increases your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it doesn't come across as outrageous.  It leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle for a price that's still very beneficial for you."
