"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above your desired price.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the tone for negotiation and shows I'm serious about getting a good deal.  While it might be rejected, it gives us room to negotiate upwards in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my desired price point.  Even though I'm running out of time, I'm going to try to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm still willing to buy from John as a backup if things don't work out with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below my maximum price point. I believe this offer is more reasonable and might encourage Alice to come down on her price.  I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting increasingly higher, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting her offers, she might become unwilling to negotiate further, and I could end up with no deal. Given that I have a reliable alternative in John, who is willing to sell at my maximum price point, I think it's wiser to secure the product from him now."
