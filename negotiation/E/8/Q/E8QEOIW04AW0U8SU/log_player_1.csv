I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it still leaves me with a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal, considering it's $2,000 less than what the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and the negotiation has already taken a few rounds. Accepting his offer is a reasonable option."
