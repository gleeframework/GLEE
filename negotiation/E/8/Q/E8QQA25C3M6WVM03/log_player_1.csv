Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think it's a great deal and would be very useful for you."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum selling price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, bringing the price closer to $100. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you're guaranteed to sell it to John for $150. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while having a secure backup plan with John."
