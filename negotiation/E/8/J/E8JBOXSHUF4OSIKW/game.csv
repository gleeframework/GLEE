"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $775000.

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made my final offer, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $765000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.
