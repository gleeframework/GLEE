"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the product's value to me. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell it for that low, but I also don't want to risk losing him as a potential buyer. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $13,000. This is still above my minimum price, but it demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving room for potential future negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,800 is getting dangerously close to my minimum price, but it's still below it. I'm starting to feel like this negotiation isn't going anywhere, and I'm concerned that Bob's offers will keep dropping.  I'm also running out of rounds.  Rather than risk getting stuck in a cycle of lowball offers, I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
