Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have gone higher. If he negotiates, you can work your way down towards your minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be stuck with the product. This allows you to be bolder in your initial offer to Bob."
