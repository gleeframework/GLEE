"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While $90 is cheaper than John's offer, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject. You're willing to pay up to $100, so it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
