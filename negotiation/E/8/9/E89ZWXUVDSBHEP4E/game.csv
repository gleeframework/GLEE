"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $22000. Let me know if that's more in line with what you're thinking.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $22000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $19500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",19500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $19500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, so I'm counteroffering at $21500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",21500.0,Alice,5,
