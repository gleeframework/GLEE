Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  The product's minimum value to both you and Bob is $1,000,000. This suggests it's something highly valuable and potentially unique. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John, your guaranteed backup buyer. You can leverage this.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high offer of $1,500,000, you set a strong anchor point in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if you started lower.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential,"" subtly justifying the high price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** You achieve a 50% profit margin, exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob negotiates:** You have room to negotiate down while still staying above your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Bob rejects:**  You sell to John at your guaranteed price, still achieving your minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while ensuring you don't lose out on the sale."
