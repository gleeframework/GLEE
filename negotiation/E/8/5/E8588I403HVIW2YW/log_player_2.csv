"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $8000 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $9000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Since Bob can buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
