"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $9,500 is still too high, and Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it leaves room for profit for you and is within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. It is also worth noting that Bob has 7 rounds left before he has to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,750 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us moving towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not ready to give up on the value I believe the product holds. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This is still a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down, $9,200 is still above Bob's ideal price point. There are still 5 rounds left, so Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,200. I'm willing to pay $8,850 for the product. This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 8850}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,850. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $9,150. This is still a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,150 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, he still has 3 rounds left to negotiate.  He should aim for a price closer to his target of $8,750."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating.  However, $9,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. This represents a good compromise for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement in the next round."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I'm still not willing to give up on the value I believe the product holds. I'm willing to meet you at $9,100, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  He has only one round left, and Alice is not willing to budge much further. Buying from John will save Bob time and potential headaches, although it will cost him more than he had hoped to pay."
