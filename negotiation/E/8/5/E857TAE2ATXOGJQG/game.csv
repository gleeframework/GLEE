,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it leaves room for profit for you and is within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,750 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us moving towards a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not ready to give up on the value I believe the product holds. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This is still a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth to me.",9200.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,850. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $9,150. This is still a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9150.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating.  However, $9,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. This represents a good compromise for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement in the next round.",8900.0,Bob,8,
