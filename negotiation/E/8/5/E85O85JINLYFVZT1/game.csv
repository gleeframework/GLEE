"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could you do $1,125,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and meets you closer to your budget.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
