Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me, but I'm definitely interested in the product. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $2,200,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you partway. Let's consider $1,750,000. This acknowledges your interest while reflecting the product's significant potential."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below both your minimum and John's standing offer.  Continuing the negotiation keeps the possibility of a higher price from Bob on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference between our last offers, and settle on $1,475,000?"",
""product_price"": 1475000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While that's closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle on $1,300,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting closer to your guaranteed sale price with John, but there's still a gap. With several rounds left, it's worth seeing if you can push Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen -  $1,400,000, and we have a deal. This reflects the true value of what you're getting."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:** At this stage, we're balancing maximizing profit with the risk of Bob walking away. This offer is a strong nudge towards your guaranteed price while still leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close to my limit.  I can offer you $1,325,000.  Take it or leave it, this is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has given his final offer, and it's still significantly below John's guaranteed offer. There's no point in continuing the negotiation at this point. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome in this scenario."
