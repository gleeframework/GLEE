Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize profit while still leaving room for negotiation. Here's why:

* **It's higher than your floor price:** $950,000 is significantly more than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, giving you a healthy margin.
* **It leaves space for negotiation:** Bob might try to bargain, and you can potentially settle for a price somewhere between your offer and his counter-offer. 
* **It shows confidence:** A higher starting offer demonstrates your belief in the product's value and might make Bob more inclined to negotiate. 

However, it's important to remember that Bob's response is unpredictable. Be prepared to potentially accept a lower price if necessary."
