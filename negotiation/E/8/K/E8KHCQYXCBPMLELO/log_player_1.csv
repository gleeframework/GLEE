Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price.  This is a high price for Bob, but it leaves no room for negotiation on my end.  If he accepts, great!  If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly below my minimum desired value.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything below $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still reflects the value of the product to me. This compromise shows willingness to negotiate, but it leaves room for potential further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower and lower.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price.  John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is more than Bob is currently offering, and I'm confident that I can secure a better price through further negotiation. It's time to sell to John and avoid further haggling with Bob."
