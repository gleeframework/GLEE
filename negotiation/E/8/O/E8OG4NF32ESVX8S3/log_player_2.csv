# Alice's message: Bob, I have a truly unique product for sale, and I believe it could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you first, but it's a high-value item, so I'm asking for $1500000.  Let me know your thoughts.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. While $800000 is below my minimum,  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's potential value to you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still outside my price range. While I understand the value of this product, my maximum budget is $800,000. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, given the potential benefits this product brings.  Let's find a way to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 800000}
