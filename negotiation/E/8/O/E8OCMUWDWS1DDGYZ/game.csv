,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
Thanks for the offer Alice. $100 is a bit above my budget. How about $85? I'm really interested in this product.,85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. While $85 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $95? It's a good compromise for both of us, and it's still within your budget.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd really like to make this deal work.",90.0,Bob,4,
