"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $950,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
