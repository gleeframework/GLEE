"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the value of your product, $900000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After reconsidering, we're willing to make a counteroffer of $850000. We believe this price still represents a great value for the product, and we're confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $750000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a profitable deal for you as well.  Let's get this done.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we understand you're sticking to your original offer, but we're willing to make one more concession. We're willing to meet you halfway between our previous offer and your original offer. We're proposing a price of $825000. This is our final offer, and we're confident it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm going to stay firm on my offer of $775000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close, but we're not willing to go all the way to $775000. We're willing to make one more concession. We're proposing a price of $810000. This is our final offer, and we're confident it's a fair compromise.",810000.0,Alice,7,
