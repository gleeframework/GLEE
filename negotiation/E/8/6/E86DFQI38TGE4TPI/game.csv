"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially setting the price at $20,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $20,000 is far above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet halfway at $14,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable to you, but $14,000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $10,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to consider it if you can meet me at $12,500. This offer stands as a sign of good faith on my end.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can't go higher than $11,000.  This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I truly hope we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $11,750.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered.",11750.0,Alice,7,
