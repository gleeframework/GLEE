"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $170, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but below my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Positive and Engaging:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to establish a baseline for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:** While Bob is clearly interested in the product, his offer is not realistic. I have room to counter with a price closer to my desired value. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John at $150 provides me with leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""middle ground"" aspect to make my offer seem reasonable.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, allowing for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about $115?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for Improvement:**  I believe there's still potential to reach a more favorable price.
* **John is the Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me confidence to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $130. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Above Minimum:** My counteroffer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, giving me room to negotiate further if needed. 
* **Moderate Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down again, but not too drastically, demonstrating that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Framing for Agreement:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to make my offer more appealing.
* **Encouraging Action:**  I'm directly asking for Bob's response to move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  How about $120? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited Negotiation:** I've already made significant concessions, and Bob's ""final offer"" statement suggests there might be little room for further negotiation.
* **John Provides Safety:**  Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed outcome, and it's worth holding out for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting closer. While $120 is tempting, I'm still just a bit off. How about $125?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm only increasing my offer by $5, which signals to Bob that I'm willing to compromise but still value the product. 
* **""Fair"" Price Framing:**  I'm reframing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us"" to encourage agreement.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm emphasizing the desire to ""finally close this deal,"" implying that this is my final offer and pushing for a quick resolution. 
* **John is Still the Backup:**  I'm confident in my ability to sell to John for $150, so I can afford to be slightly flexible with Bob."
