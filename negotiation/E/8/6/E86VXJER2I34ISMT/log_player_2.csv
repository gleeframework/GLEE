Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting closer. While $120 is tempting, I'm still just a bit off. How about $125?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's time to switch to John.  Alice is unlikely to go below $125, and you have a guaranteed offer for $120 from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
