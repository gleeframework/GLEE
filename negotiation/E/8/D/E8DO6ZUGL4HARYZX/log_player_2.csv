"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. This is a one-time offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's offer of $10,000, but it's still above your ideal price point.  You should reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with her or potentially find another seller."
