"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $900,000? I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $925,000. This is still a great value considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
