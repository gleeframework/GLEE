"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This still allows for a healthy margin for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works for both parties.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
