"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than her first offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,750.  I think this is a fair price considering we are both trying to make a deal here.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal and save as much money as he can.  While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There's still a small window for negotiation, and Bob wants to see if he can push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10800}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,950. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,950 is very close to Bob's ideal price and is a good deal considering that John is selling the same product for $12,000. It's unlikely that Bob will be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds.  Accepting the offer is the most logical choice to ensure Bob gets a good deal and avoids a potential risk of not being able to reach an agreement with Alice."
