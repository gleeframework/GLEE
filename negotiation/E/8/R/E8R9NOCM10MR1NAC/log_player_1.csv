I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in this price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the following rounds."

Round 3

{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal within a few more rounds."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, I'm still hoping to secure a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm reducing my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a price closer to my initial target. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum price.  While I'd like to push for a higher price, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  I'll accept his offer of $1,275,000 to secure the sale."
