,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $10,500? I'm confident this product is worth that to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm on a tight budget. Could we do it for $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $10,125? That's a fair compromise, and I believe this product will be a great investment for you.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I need to stay closer to my budget. Would you be willing to settle for $9,900?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,900 is still not quite there for me.  How about $10,000?  That's my absolute minimum, but I think you'll agree it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's close the deal!",10000.0,Alice,7,
