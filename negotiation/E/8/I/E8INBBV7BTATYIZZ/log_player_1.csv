"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking of an offer around $12000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm not comfortable with his initial price, I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price.  I'll see what counteroffer he gives me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However,  $12,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $15,000 to be fair. This is a good deal for both of us, so let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. While $15000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be open to considering $13500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $13,500 is closer to my target, but I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $14,250. This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair price for a product of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $14250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be open to considering $13750? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm getting close to my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I'd prefer a higher price, $13,750 is a good amount, and it's getting late in the negotiation.  I'm happy to accept Bob's offer."
