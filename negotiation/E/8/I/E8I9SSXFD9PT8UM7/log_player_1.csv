Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, but still ensures a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going too close to $15,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could scare him away. 
 
This strategy balances risk and reward to aim for the highest possible profit while still making the sale likely."
