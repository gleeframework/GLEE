"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose an offer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation and allows us to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and the potential benefits it brings to you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
