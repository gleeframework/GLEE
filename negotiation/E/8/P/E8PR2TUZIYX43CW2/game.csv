"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to match this price again. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
