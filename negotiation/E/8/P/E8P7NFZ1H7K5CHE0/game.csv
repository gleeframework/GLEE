"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to consider $9,000 as a maximum price. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",9750.0,Bob,4,
