Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to consider $9,000 as a maximum price. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, it's unlikely he'll go above $10,000. John offers a guaranteed $10,000, so it makes more financial sense to sell to him at this point."
