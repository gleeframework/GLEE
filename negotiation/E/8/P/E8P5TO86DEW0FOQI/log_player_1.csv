Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, we want to see if we can get a better price from Bob first. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $14,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts, we've secured a great deal. If he rejects it, we can always fall back on John's offer or potentially negotiate a slightly lower price with Bob."
