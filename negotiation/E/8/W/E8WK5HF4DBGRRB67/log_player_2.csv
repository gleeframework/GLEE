"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you the product for $600,000. I believe this is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $600,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, but still a bit too high. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming up to $700,000.  I'm still a bit away from my target, though. How about we settle on $725,000?  That's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're close to your target, but I'm not willing to go up to $725,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $715,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $715,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $725,000.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure a deal. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price."
