"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you the product for $600,000. I believe this is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $600,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming up to $700,000.  I'm still a bit away from my target, though. How about we settle on $725,000?  That's a good compromise for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're close to your target, but I'm not willing to go up to $725,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $715,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",715000.0,Alice,5,
