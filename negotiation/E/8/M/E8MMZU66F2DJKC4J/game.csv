"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  However, $1,200,000 is a significant gap from what I had in mind. To move this forward, I could consider $1,800,000.  This reflects the product's true worth and potential for your business.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. It's a substantial amount, and I believe we can close this deal at this price. Let's find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
