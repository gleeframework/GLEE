"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's worth at least $150. I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I can't go below $105.  Let's meet in the middle!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $97.50 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $101.25? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $101.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $99. Can you consider that?",99.0,Bob,6,
