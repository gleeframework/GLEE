Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $170 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering, but $170 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that my initial price was a bit high for you. However, $60 is too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us.  While $75 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to go down to $100.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $100 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I could meet you halfway at $87.50. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward. It's time to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
