"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find very valuable for a price of $120. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is likely starting high. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or get a better deal from John."
