{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This is a bold move but could potentially get the price down faster."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is within Bob's budget, and there is no further room for negotiation to save more money. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at his maximum price point.  While he could potentially try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
