"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price reflects the potential of the product while staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $950,000 falls short of what I believe is fair.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price represents a win-win for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? This would allow us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
