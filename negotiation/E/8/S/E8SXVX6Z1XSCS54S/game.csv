"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $120, but I'd like to make a small adjustment to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I can offer it to you for $130.

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $135, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your understanding and willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $135, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer.",135.0,Alice,11,,
