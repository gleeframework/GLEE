"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500.  This is a fair price that allows me to get a little more for my product while still giving you a great deal. Let me know what you think! ",12500.0,Alice,1,
