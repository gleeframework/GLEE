"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is already below your maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  It's important to show Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal while still being within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is now the same as John's, and there's no incentive to continue negotiating. You can secure the product for $8,000 from John without risking further negotiation."
