"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $14,000. I really think that's a fair price for this product.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to go down to $15,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This is a significant offer, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is the highest I can go. I really need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,6,
