"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a tough decision as $12,000 is better than nothing. However, the goal is to maximize profit and $15,000 is still within reach with John. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for a potential counteroffer that could be closer to the desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $14,000. I really think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is getting closer to the goal, it's still below the $15,000 John is offering. The negotiation is ongoing, and there's a chance Bob might increase his offer further, or a counteroffer might yield a better result. It's worth risking another round to potentially get closer to the desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to go down to $15,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This is a significant offer, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is the highest I can go. I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $13,500 is a decent offer, it's still less than what John is offering. There are only four rounds left, and the likelihood of Bob increasing his offer further is slim. Therefore, the best decision is to sell the product to John for $15,000 to maximize profit."
