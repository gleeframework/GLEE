Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** This exists between $1,000,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair price for such a valuable asset."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** This price is significantly above Bob's perceived value but leaves you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Confidence:**  The language is framed positively, emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair price,"" conveying that you believe in the value of your product.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get $1,400,000, which is fantastic!
* **Bob Negotiates:**  He might counter with a lower offer. You have room to come down while still staying above your $1,500,000 guarantee.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000.

**Important Note:**  This assumes you have no time pressure. If you need to sell quickly, you might adjust your offer down a bit to increase the chance of Bob accepting."
