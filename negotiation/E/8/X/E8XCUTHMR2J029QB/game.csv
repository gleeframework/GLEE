"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value in this product, $1500000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. If you're still interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to purchase at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
