# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $12,000.  Rejecting her offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite a bit higher than that to me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
