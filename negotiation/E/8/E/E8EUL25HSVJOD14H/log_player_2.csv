{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,040,000 is very close to my target price, but with only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal is too high.  It's not worth risking it.  I can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget and guarantees I'll get the product."
