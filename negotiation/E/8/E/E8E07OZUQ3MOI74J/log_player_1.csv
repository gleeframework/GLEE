{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit while still being attractive to Bob, as he would be getting a $1,000 discount from what it's worth to him.  This should encourage negotiation, but I'm also prepared to sell to John for $12,000 if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While I'm happy to sell for $12,000, I'd prefer to make more profit.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let it go that low. I'd be willing to come down to $13,000. That still gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500? That's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is a good compromise.  I'm getting closer to my desired price and still making a reasonable profit.  I'll accept his offer."
