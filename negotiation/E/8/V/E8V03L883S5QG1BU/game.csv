"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value might be high to you, but I believe I can find it at a lower price elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $9500 for it. Looking forward to your response.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still seeking a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us both.",10000.0,Bob,4,
