Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit.
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is an option, briefly mentioning the product's value might make Bob more amenable to the higher price.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John. This allows you to be a bit bolder in your initial offer to Bob."
