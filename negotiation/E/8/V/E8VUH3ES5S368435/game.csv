"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I think it could really benefit your business. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,900,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  To start our negotiations, I'm offering $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product.  Let's discuss!",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However,  $1,250,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  This product has significant value that I'm confident would benefit your business.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
