Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,900,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  To start our negotiations, I'm offering $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product.  Let's discuss! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we are still below our absolute minimum and John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000.  There's no guarantee Bob will go any higher, so it's more strategic to take the guaranteed offer from John."
