"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I see the value in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000 for it. How about we meet in the middle? ",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is lower than I hoped for, I understand you have a budget. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $1,400,000? This offer reflects a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while working within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I need to stay above my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while ensuring I can meet my needs.  Let's make this deal happen!",1550000.0,Alice,5,
