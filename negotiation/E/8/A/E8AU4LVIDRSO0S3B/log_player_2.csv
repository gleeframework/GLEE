"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this incredible asset. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a competitive price of $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $800,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but I can likely get a better price.  I'll try to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $725,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is a good price for me.  It's still a significant saving compared to buying from John, and I'm not sure I can get much lower. I'll accept this offer."
