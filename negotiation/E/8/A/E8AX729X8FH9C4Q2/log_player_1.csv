{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is my minimum value, I believe there's still potential to get a higher price from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my initial asking price, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm reducing my initial offer by $3,000, showing a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer still allows for potential profit above my minimum value while being more realistic than my initial asking price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is closer to my desired price. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $1,000 and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a potential stalemate."
