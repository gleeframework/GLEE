"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $10,500 for the product. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $11,500, but still higher than Alice's minimum value of $10,000. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while also demonstrating that he is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price but lower than John's price.  Given that Alice has already rejected one counteroffer,  it's likely she won't go lower than this price. It's more advantageous for Bob to accept the offer and save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
