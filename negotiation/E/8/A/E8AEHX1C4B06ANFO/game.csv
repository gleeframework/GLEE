"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your starting price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
