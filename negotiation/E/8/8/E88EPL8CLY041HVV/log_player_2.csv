"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better price by counter-offering.  Alice values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Buying from John immediately would be worse than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and also leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject his offer and he could end up buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
