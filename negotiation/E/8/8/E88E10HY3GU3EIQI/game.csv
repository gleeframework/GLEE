"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping for a bit more.  How about $9000?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. How about $7500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $7500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $9000.  Let's split the difference and go with $8500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to continue operating my business. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. How about $7000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",7000.0,Bob,6,
