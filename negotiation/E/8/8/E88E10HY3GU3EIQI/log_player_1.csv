"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to try to get a little more than $8,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping for a bit more.  How about $9,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $7,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to continue operating my business. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. How about $7000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:

This is a tough decision, but I'm starting to feel like I won't get my desired price from Bob.  John offers a guaranteed $8,000, which is my minimum, so I'll take that option."
