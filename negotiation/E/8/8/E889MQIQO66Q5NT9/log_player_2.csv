"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  I know it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.  This is a significant discount considering its value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000.
