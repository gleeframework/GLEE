"I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I'm still a bit above my budget at $11,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
