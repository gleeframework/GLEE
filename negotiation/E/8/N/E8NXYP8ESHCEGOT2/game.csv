"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Would you be willing to sell it to me at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm trying to find a fair price.  While I can't do $10,000, I can come down slightly to $11,500. This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
