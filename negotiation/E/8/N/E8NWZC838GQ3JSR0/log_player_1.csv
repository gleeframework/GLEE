Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **We're close to your walk-away point:** John offers $15,000, and Bob is now at $14,000. The difference is getting smaller.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or even Bob walking away.  
* **Profit is still good:**  While not the initial $20,000, $14,000 is still a significant profit above your minimum. 

Taking the $14,000 now guarantees a good deal without risking losing the sale entirely."
