I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,250,000.  This is a starting point that is slightly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, $1,150,000 is significantly lower than my minimum. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,200,000. This is my minimum price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  I'm hoping Bob will see that and be willing to close the deal."
