I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a starting point that is higher than what the product is worth to me, but lower than what it's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if necessary.  

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer. If it's significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept, I'll either make a counteroffer or choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to sell for $1,000,000.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still a profitable price for me and it's closer to Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this counteroffer will entice Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough for me to accept.  I'm going to make another counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000. This is a very slight concession, but it's a good faith effort to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm very likely to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's also higher than what I can get from John.  It's time to close the deal."
