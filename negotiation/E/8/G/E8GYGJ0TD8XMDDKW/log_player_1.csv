Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,500 is a bit high for me. Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price is fair to both of us and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
