"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,500 is a bit high for me. Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price is fair to both of us and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its worth $12,000 to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
