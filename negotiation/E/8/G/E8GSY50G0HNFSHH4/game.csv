"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to work with me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm going to need a bit lower price to make it work for me. How about $6,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $6,800. It's a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",6800.0,Alice,3,
