"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $120, but that's my final price. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm still trying to maximize my profit but am willing to compromise slightly. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer, hoping to push Bob towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not going to risk selling it for less than $150 with John waiting in the wings. I'll counteroffer again, but I might also start considering selling to John if the negotiation doesn't move further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $117.50. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground while still protecting my minimum profit. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer, hoping to push Bob towards accepting and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $117.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiation with Bob is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time.  While I could counteroffer again, the risk of further rejection and getting stuck with a price below $150 is too high.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $150 from John."
