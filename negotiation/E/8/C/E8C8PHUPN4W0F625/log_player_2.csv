"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get a better deal. While $1,000,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get it for less by counteroffering.  He should aim for a price closer to Alice's valuation of $1,000,000, but still leave room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $900,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's original offer of $1,000,000 but still higher than Alice's valuation of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a better deal than buying from John, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Bob should continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to bring the price down further.  By rejecting this offer, Bob signals his willingness to walk away, which could encourage Alice to make a more attractive counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $1,100,000, which is a compromise between Alice's last offer of $1,200,000 and his previous offer of $900,000. This signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but is still looking for a better price. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough choice.  Buying from John for $1,500,000 is significantly more expensive than accepting Alice's offer. 

Here's why accepting Alice's offer at $1,250,000 makes sense:

* **Saves Money:** It's still cheaper than buying from John.
* **Possible Future Negotiation:**  While Alice seems firm, there might be room for negotiation later if Bob needs a lower price for future deals.
* **Time:** This is the best price Bob has gotten from Alice so far.  Continuing to negotiate could take time and might not result in a better offer.

By accepting, Bob gets the product at a good price while saving time and money compared to buying from John."
