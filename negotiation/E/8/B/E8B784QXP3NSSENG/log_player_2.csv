"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $13,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefit you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $13,000 is too high. You can get the product for $15,000 from John if necessary, but there's room for negotiation with Alice to get a better price."
