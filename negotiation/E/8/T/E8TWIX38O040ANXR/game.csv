"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $700,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $750,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
