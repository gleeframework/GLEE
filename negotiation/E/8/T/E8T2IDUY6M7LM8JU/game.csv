"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a compromise at $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $115 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you $130. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
