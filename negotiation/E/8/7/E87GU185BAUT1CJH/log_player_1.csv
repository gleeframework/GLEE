Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my desired $10,000.  I'm also aware that I have John as a backup option if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can still get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  I'll aim for a price somewhere between his offer and my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $10,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as it's closer to his desired price than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is now lower than my minimum price of $10,000.  I'm not willing to go lower than that, and I know I can get that price from John. Therefore, I'll sell the product to John."
