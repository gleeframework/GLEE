"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not desperate to sell and have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $1,300,000 is still below my acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll need to see a more substantial increase in the offer."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still a significant undervalue of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000.

**Reasoning:**

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your continued interest and your latest offer. While $1,400,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my minimum.

**Reasoning:**

We're in the 8th round, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, we still have a gap.  I'm not willing to risk going through another round and potentially ending up with a deal that's still below my minimum acceptable price. It's better to sell to John now and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."
