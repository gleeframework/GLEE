"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1200000 is simply not enough. It's significantly below the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1700000, considering your budget constraints. This price reflects the true potential of this product while acknowledging your reasonable needs.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1700000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1300000 is still a significant undervalue of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1600000. This reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's finalize this agreement within the remaining rounds.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
