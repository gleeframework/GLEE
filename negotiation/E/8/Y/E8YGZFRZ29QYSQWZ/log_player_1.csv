Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($150) increases the chances of him accepting while still securing a significant profit for you.

By offering $140, you leave some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, but you still secure a $20 profit above your minimum."
