"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better.  He'll start by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's fair to both of them. He's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable value of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation and shows that Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest.  While $11000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's meet in the middle at $12000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's target:**  $12,000 is within Bob's budget and closer to his ideal price.
* **Further negotiation risks a deal with John:**  While Bob could counteroffer again, there's a risk Alice might keep rejecting and Bob could end up buying from John at a higher price.
* **Time is a factor:** The negotiation is progressing well, and accepting now secures the product for a reasonable price without risking further delays or John's offer."
