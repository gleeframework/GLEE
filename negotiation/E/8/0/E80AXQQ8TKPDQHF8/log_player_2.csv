{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The initial offer from Alice is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's more beneficial to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This is a bold move, but it establishes my willingness to negotiate and potentially motivates Alice to consider a lower price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to my maximum budget. There are still rounds left, and I can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still staying below my maximum budget. This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm serious about negotiating and hopefully will encourage Alice to meet me halfway."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. While it's tempting to accept, I'm only a few rounds away from my fallback option, which is buying from John.  There's still potential to negotiate further and potentially reach a price closer to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a final counteroffer at my absolute maximum budget.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to go higher.  At this point, if she rejects it, I'll move on to John's offer, as there's no further room for negotiation."
