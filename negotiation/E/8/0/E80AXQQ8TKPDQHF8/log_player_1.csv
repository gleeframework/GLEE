"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming for a good profit. This also gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. This should hopefully encourage Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I believe Bob is getting serious and might be willing to meet me halfway."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in risking further negotiation, as I could end up with a lower price or lose the deal entirely. Accepting this offer guarantees me a good price and secures the sale."
