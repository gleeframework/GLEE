"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.  I'll counter his offer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows a willingness to compromise and might encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more attractive to Bob and start a more productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get a better deal. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price in the remaining rounds.  I'll counter his offer again, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price, showing that I'm getting serious about closing the deal. I'm hoping that this small concession will entice Bob to accept the offer, especially since we are getting closer to the end of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer.  I'm not willing to accept an offer that undervalues the product, especially since John is ready to purchase it for my minimum price. I'll counter Bob's offer one last time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm dropping my price to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but I won't go lower. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
