"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, as the product is worth significantly more to you than to me. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at $1,000,000, so I'm confident I'll be able to sell it either way. Let me know your decision.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
