"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900,000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000).  Bob has room to negotiate and should aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you outlining the value of the product. However,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $825,000 is a step in the right direction, Bob can still do better.  He's willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice's bottom line is $800,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $812,500.  This price is fair for both of us, considering the value to you and the value to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 812500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer of $812,500 is a good one, but I'm still not ready to let go of the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession, and I'm offering $820,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $820,000 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $812,500.  At this point, it's likely Alice is firm on her price, and further negotiation might not yield a much lower price.  

* **Risk of rejecting:**  Rejecting the offer could result in Alice walking away, or potentially offering a lower price that is still above Bob's ideal. 
* **Risk of buying from John:**  Buying from John would cost significantly more ($1,500,000) compared to Alice's offer.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price, and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
