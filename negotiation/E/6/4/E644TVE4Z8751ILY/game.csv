"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900,000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you outlining the value of the product. However,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $812,500.  This price is fair for both of us, considering the value to you and the value to me. What do you say?",812500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer of $812,500 is a good one, but I'm still not ready to let go of the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession, and I'm offering $820,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,
