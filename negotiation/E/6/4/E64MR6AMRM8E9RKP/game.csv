"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This price reflects the value of the product and is still within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $980000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1015000. This price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1015000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but $990000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1005000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If you're serious about this deal, I'm ready to close it now. Otherwise, I have another buyer waiting.",1005000.0,Alice,7,
