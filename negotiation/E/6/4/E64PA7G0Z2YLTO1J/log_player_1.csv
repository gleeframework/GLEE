"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm starting negotiations at $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your desired price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Anchoring:** The initial price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if it's high, it can influence his counter-offers to be closer to my starting point.
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:** By starting at $1,100,000, there's space to make concessions during the rounds of negotiation, which can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John will buy at $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback, allowing me to confidently negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Early Stage:** It's only round 2, and I have room to negotiate. Accepting such a low offer this early would be leaving a lot of potential profit on the table.
* **Strategy:** By rejecting, I signal that I'm serious about a higher price and encourage Bob to make a more competitive offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is substantial. I could consider coming down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant investment for both of us, and I want to ensure we find a mutually agreeable price."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I've reduced my price by $50,000 from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Concession:** The reduction is not too drastic. It keeps me closer to my target price and avoids appearing desperate.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, reinforcing its worth and justifying a higher price. 
* **Collaborative Tone:**  Framing the negotiation as finding a ""mutually agreeable price"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Bob is moving closer to my range, the increments are small. Accepting now would still mean a significant loss compared to my minimum and John's offer. 
* **Leverage Time:** I still have several rounds left.  Continuing the negotiation puts a bit of time pressure on Bob and might make him more willing to concede further.
* **Alternative Security:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at a higher price gives me the confidence to push Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we aim for a price of $1,020,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while acknowledging the value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1020000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I've reduced my price by $30,000 this round, indicating I'm nearing my limit but still open to negotiation.
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  This counteroffer is slightly closer to my last offer than Bob's, but the framing suggests a compromise. 
* **Limited Time:**  While I have rounds left, I want to create a subtle sense of urgency to encourage Bob to move closer to my price point. 
* **Maintaining Confidence:** The message emphasizes the product's value and my commitment to the deal without sounding desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to find a mutually agreeable price, Alice. However, $1,020,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $980,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing the Waters:**  While $980,000 is getting closer, I want to see if Bob is willing to cross the psychologically important $1 million mark. 
* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiation. Rejecting now might push Bob to make a more significant jump in his next offer as time is running out.
* **Strong Alternative:** My guaranteed offer from John gives me the leverage to hold firm and aim for a price closer to my target. 
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a risk that Bob might walk away, but the potential reward of getting a higher price from him is worth the risk at this stage."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I can see you're serious about this product. To show I'm flexible, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon and have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm firm on this price.
* **Strategic Number:** $1,000,000 is a strong psychological threshold. It's a significant concession from my initial offer but still a good profit margin.
* **Limited Time:**  Mentioning other interested parties (even if it's just John) reinforces that I have other options if Bob doesn't agree. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message aims to maintain a positive relationship while making it clear that this is the best I can do."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $970,000 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:**  Bob's offer of $970,000 shows he's unwilling to meet my final offer of $1,000,000. He's incrementing in small amounts and likely hoping I'll cave due to time pressure.
* **Minimal Gains:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point carries more risk than potential reward. The difference between his current offer and my target price is relatively small compared to the guaranteed offer from John. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Every round spent negotiating with Bob is a round I'm not closing a deal with John.  The longer I wait, the greater the chance that John might find another opportunity or change his mind.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Having a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 provides me with a safe and highly profitable exit strategy.  It's time to exercise that option."
