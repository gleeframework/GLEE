Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a reasonable discount for Bob, but still leaves you with a profit above your minimum. It's also open-ended, inviting Bob to negotiate further if he's not satisfied with the initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can do $78. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $78 is still too low, and I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is taking too long.  While I'd prefer to get more, I can't risk Bob rejecting my counteroffer again.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'll take his offer of $80 to avoid further delays."
