We're still significantly above John's offer. Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we have room to negotiate."

While we could push for more, Bob is consistently moving upwards and we're now well above John's offer. Accepting at $920,000 secures a significant profit. Holding out carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through entirely."
