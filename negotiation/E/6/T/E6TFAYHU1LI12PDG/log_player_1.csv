"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $140. It's in great condition and would be a great value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's value but still above my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. The product looks great, but I was hoping to spend closer to $110. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $110 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price from $140 to $130. This shows flexibility and good faith while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I've already been through several rounds of negotiation. Accepting his offer is the best option to ensure I sell the product and avoid further negotiation."
