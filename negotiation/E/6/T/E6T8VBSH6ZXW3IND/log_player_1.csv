This offer is a starting point. It's lower than my minimum, but still a profit for me. This allows for negotiation and keeps Bob engaged in the process. I can then adjust my price depending on his reaction."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a low price. I will counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500 to reflect your budget.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I believe I can push for a higher price, as I know the product is worth $12,000 to him. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
