"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with an offer above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for concessions and creates the perception that you value the product highly.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,300,000, we establish a high anchor point in Bob's mind. This can influence his counteroffers and make him potentially more agreeable to a price higher than $1,500,000.
* **Confidence:** A strong initial offer conveys confidence in the product's value.

This is just the first move in a strategic negotiation. We'll need to carefully consider Bob's responses and adjust our approach accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our minimum ($1,500,000) and his own stated value for the product. Accepting this would be a substantial loss. We need to guide the negotiation towards a more reasonable range.  We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,900,000. This reflects the product's potential while leaving room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Jump from Bob's Offer:** We want to clearly signal that $800,000 is unacceptable while still demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Moving Towards Midpoint:** This counteroffer gradually moves towards a potential compromise price in the middle ground between our initial offer and Bob's lowball.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  By reiterating the product's worth, we're aiming to shift Bob's focus away from solely lowballing and towards recognizing a fairer valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. I could go up to $1,100,000.  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is moving in the right direction, it's still significantly below our $1,500,000 minimum. We need to hold firm and signal that we're willing to walk away from the deal if necessary. The presence of John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives us leverage. We'll provide another counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, to be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready to purchase the product at $1,500,000.  To make this deal worthwhile for me, I need to be in that ballpark. I'm willing to consider your perspective, but only if we can significantly bridge the gap.  My final offer is $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition (John):** By revealing the existence of John and his offer, we create a sense of urgency and competition. This strengthens our position and shows Bob we have alternative options.
* **Firm but Fair:** While we are being firm by stating our minimum acceptable price, we are also demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by slightly lowering our ask. 
* **Finality:**  By presenting this as our ""final offer,"" we are putting the ball firmly in Bob's court. This emphasizes the seriousness of our position and encourages him to make a decision."
