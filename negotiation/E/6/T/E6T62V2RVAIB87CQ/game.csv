"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects its true worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,900,000. This reflects the product's potential while leaving room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. I could go up to $1,100,000.  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on it.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, to be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready to purchase the product at $1,500,000.  To make this deal worthwhile for me, I need to be in that ballpark. I'm willing to consider your perspective, but only if we can significantly bridge the gap.  My final offer is $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
