Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept at this time.  I'm willing to be flexible, however, and I believe a price of $1,100,000 would be fair to both of us. This still leaves significant room for you to profit from the product, and it allows me to achieve my desired return. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.
