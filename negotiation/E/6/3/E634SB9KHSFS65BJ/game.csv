"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit below what I believe the product is worth.  I could meet you halfway - how about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm confident that $1,400,000 is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's find a way to bridge this gap.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
