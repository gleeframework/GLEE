Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point, as it shows you're willing to be flexible while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, but it's still worth trying to negotiate a higher price.  You can likely secure a better deal than $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1425000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows you're willing to negotiate while still protecting your profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still a good deal, especially since it's getting late in the negotiation.  It's better to secure a sale for $1,380,000 than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for $1,200,000."
