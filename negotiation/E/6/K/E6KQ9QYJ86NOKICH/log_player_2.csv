Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price would be $1350000. This way, we can both benefit from the transaction.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $1275000 is still a bit below my target. How about we meet in the middle again, at $1325000? This is the best I can do.
