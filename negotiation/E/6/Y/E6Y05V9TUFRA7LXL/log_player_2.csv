**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than John's price.
* **You still get a good deal:** Even at $1,200,000, you are saving $300,000 compared to your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 

It's always better to accept a lower offer, even if it's not the absolute lowest price possible, especially when you have a backup option."
