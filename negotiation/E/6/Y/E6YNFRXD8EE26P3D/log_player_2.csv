"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000,  Bob can still potentially get the product for a lower price by counteroffering. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price to secure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  However, I'm only able to pay $8,500 for the product right now. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There's a possibility that Alice might be willing to negotiate further."
