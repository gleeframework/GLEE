"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $850,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a comfortable profit margin for you. I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. This price still allows for a reasonable profit margin while acknowledging your valuation of the item. I am hopeful that this proposal will lead to a satisfactory agreement for both parties. Please let me know if this revised offer meets your expectations.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's aim to finalize this deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
