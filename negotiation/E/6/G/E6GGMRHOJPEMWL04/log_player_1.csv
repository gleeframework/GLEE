Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $150 as possible, but I need to offer Bob a price that's tempting. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $80. Offering it at $140 gives him a chance to make a $60 profit if he finds a buyer willing to pay more.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no pressure to go below my minimum. 

This strategy balances maximizing my potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
