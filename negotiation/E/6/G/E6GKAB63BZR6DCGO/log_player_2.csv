"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a price closer to my $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but that's still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  That's a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to come down to a price I'm comfortable with. At this point, it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement. It's better to avoid further negotiation and simply buy the product from John for $8,000, which is within my budget."
