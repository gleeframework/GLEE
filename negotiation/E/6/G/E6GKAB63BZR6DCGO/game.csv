"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but that's still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  That's a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
