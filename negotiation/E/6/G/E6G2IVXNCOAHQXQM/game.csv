"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still a substantial profit for me. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the profit you'll still make.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1350000. This still leaves a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1305000. I think this is a fair compromise that still allows us to reach an agreement.",1305000.0,Bob,4,
