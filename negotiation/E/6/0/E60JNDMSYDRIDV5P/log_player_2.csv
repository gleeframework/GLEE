Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a good deal. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell it to you for $90. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90, and it's better to secure the product at the known $80 price from John."
