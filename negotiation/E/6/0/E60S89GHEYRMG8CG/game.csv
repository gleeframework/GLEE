"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm firm on $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit low.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,275,000? This is a price that's fair for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal and move forward. ",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. I hope we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there!  I'm willing to come down to $1,240,000. This is a very fair price that reflects the value of this product for you, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. What do you say?",1240000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,240,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, and that's my final offer. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
