"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This gives Bob a good incentive to accept, but also allows me to potentially increase the price if he counteroffers.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is still a good profit, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,400,000. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm firm on $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm sticking to a price that's still higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of my profits.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob's business to increase his desire to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to settle.  I believe I can get a better deal, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit low.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,275,000? This is a price that's fair for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal and move forward. "", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway again. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties. By emphasizing a ""fair"" price, I appeal to Bob's sense of reason and hopefully encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. I hope we can meet in the middle and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,225,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I'm confident I can still get a better deal, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there!  I'm willing to come down to $1,240,000. This is a very fair price that reflects the value of this product for you, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1240000} 
```

I'm offering a smaller compromise this time to signal that I'm getting serious about closing the deal. By highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price and emphasizing a quick closure, I aim to persuade Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,240,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, and that's my final offer. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is being stubborn and isn't budging from his price.  I'm running out of time, and while $1,200,000 is a decent profit, I'm not comfortable settling for less than my initial target of $1,400,000.  I'm going to take John's offer of $1,000,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking that we won't reach an agreement."
