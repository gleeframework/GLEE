"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,250,000 at this point.  I think this is a fair price considering its potential and my budget. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,250,000 is too low for me to consider.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,325,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while acknowledging the value this product holds.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,325,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. How about $1,300,000? I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
