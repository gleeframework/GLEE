Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,250,000 at this point.  I think this is a fair price considering its potential and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my target price and the product's actual value to him. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,250,000 is too low for me to consider.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,325,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while acknowledging the value this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,325,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. How about $1,300,000? I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly very interested and is willing to pay a price that's significantly over my minimum. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling. $1,300,000 is a good profit."
