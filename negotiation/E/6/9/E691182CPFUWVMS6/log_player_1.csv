Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than that.
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** $125 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80) but still a potential saving compared to my other offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While I'm aiming high, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if the price is too steep. 
 
This strategy attempts to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still securing a sale."
