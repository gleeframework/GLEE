"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has offered the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. There's no room for negotiation upwards from here. Since I can get my minimum acceptable price from John, it makes more sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation rounds."
