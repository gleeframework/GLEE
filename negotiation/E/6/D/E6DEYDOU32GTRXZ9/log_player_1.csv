Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects its potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $800000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below the product's worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob and see if we can find a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but  $1,000,000 is my lowest offer. This is a significant opportunity for you and I'm confident the product will generate much more than that in return.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1000000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good deal.  I'm happy to accept it and move forward with the sale."
