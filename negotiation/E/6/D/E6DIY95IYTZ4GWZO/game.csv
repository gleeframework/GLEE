"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $100. I believe this is a fair price and would be a good deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To find a mutually beneficial solution, I would like to propose a price of $125 for the product. This still allows you to gain value from the product while ensuring we receive a fair compensation for it. I look forward to your consideration.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you working with me. While $125 is closer, it's still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That feels like a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
