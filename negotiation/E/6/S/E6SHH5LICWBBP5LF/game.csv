"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I see the value in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? ",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is closer, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! $725,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $850,000? I think that's a fair price for the value this product brings.",850000.0,Alice,5,
