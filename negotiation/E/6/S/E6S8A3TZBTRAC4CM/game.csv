"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and I'll do $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $7,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",8125.0,Alice,5,
