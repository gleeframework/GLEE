Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be more aggressive with Bob. Aiming slightly below his maximum value increases your chances of a successful deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and based on my understanding, it could be worth $1,200,000 to your operations. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message clearly states your intention and Bob's potential gain.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning your understanding of the product's value to Bob provides context for your pricing.
* **Slight Discount:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 incentive to buy from you while still securing a $150,000 profit for yourself.

**Important Notes**

* Bob might try to negotiate. Be prepared to adjust slightly downward, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* This is a one-time offer scenario, so make it count!"
