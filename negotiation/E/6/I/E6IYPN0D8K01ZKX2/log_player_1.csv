Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $110. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially earn more. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $110 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (like $100), which would still be a profit for you.
* **First Refusal Tactic:** By framing the offer as a ""first refusal"" before a public listing, you create a sense of scarcity and potential loss for Bob if he doesn't take the deal."
