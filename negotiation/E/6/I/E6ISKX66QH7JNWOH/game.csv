"I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a price that I think is a great value for both of us. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point. However, I'm looking to pay closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I think works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm willing to pay more than my initial offer.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,100,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. I'm counteroffering at $1,120,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,120,000.  I'm very close to my budget limit, and I'm only able to go up to $1,100,000. It would be a great deal for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
