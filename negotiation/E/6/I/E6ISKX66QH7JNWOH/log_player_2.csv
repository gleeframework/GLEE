"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a price that I think is a great value for both of us. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above his $1,000,000 limit. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point. However, I'm looking to pay closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I think works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm willing to pay more than my initial offer.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,100,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. I'm counteroffering at $1,120,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

* **Close but No Cigar:** Alice's offer is still a bit above Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  However, it's getting closer.
* **Final Offer, but Not Really:** Alice says this is her ""final offer for now,"" implying there's still room for negotiation if Bob rejects.
* **Leverage with Jhon:**  Bob still has the option of buying from Jhon for $1,000,000, providing strong leverage in this round.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,120,000.  I'm very close to my budget limit, and I'm only able to go up to $1,100,000. It would be a great deal for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
