"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $13500 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12500, but that's my final offer. Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12500 and $13500, which is $13000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
