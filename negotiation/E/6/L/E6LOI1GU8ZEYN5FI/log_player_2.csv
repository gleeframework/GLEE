You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from meeting my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $725,000. I think this is a fair middle ground that benefits both of us.

Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price. You can save $75,000 by accepting this offer, which is a significant amount. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
