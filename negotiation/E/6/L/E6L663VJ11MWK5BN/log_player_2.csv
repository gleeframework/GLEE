"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount of money.  There's room for negotiation and you can likely get a better price. It's worth trying to see if you can get Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is a significant discount from Alice's original price of $120. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm willing to negotiate. It's a fair starting point for the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $120 to $110. This is a good price for me, as it's within my budget and lower than the price John is offering.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I may end up paying more or having to buy from John. It's better to take this offer and secure the product at a good price."
