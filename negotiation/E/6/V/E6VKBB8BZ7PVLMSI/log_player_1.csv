""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I'm looking for a price around $11,500.  It's a fantastic product and I think you'll find it incredibly valuable. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is fine, providing a reason (""before I list it publicly"") can make the offer seem more appealing and time-sensitive.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer is as much about gauging Bob's interest as it is about getting him to agree to $11,500.  His response will tell us if we need to go lower or can hold firm.

**Important Note:**  Even though we have John as a backup, it's still ideal to get a deal done with Bob if possible.  A bird in hand is worth two in the bush!"
