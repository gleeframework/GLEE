Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your persistence. I really appreciate it. I believe $8,000 is a fair price for the product. Can we agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to budge past $8,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk he walks away. Accepting his offer now secures a sale and avoids potentially getting stuck with the product."
