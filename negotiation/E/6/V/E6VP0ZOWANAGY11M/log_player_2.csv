Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good deal. Let's make this happen!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this work for me. This is a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable at this price.  Let's keep the negotiation going. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly from $11,000.  You've reached a point where the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are outweighed by the guaranteed price from John."
