"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested, but only if we can settle on a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $7,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
