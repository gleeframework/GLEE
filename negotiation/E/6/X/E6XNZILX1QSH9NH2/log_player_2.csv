Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming closer to your target price, it's unlikely she'll go below $8,000.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John right now, so there's no point in risking further negotiation."
