"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000.  Would that work for you?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your target price is $700,000, but I'm still willing to negotiate further. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value while being closer to your target price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but to make this work I'd need to be at $750,000.  Do you think that's possible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.
