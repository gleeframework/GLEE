"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's too early to buy from John, as you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  Starting with a lower offer than your maximum budget ($8,000) demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Clear Communication:** The message explains your reasoning and shows you are serious about buying.
* **Reasonable Offer:** While $7,000 is a significant reduction, it leaves room for further negotiation.

Let's see how Alice responds to this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $9500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice has lowered her price, $9,500 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, as Alice has indicated she is willing to compromise.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Buying from John at this point would be the safe option, but it might limit your potential savings.  

Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Increase your offer incrementally to show a genuine effort to meet Alice's needs.
* **Reasoning:** Explain why your offer is fair and emphasize mutual benefit.
* **Closing Distance:**  This offer is still below your maximum budget, but it signals a willingness to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my original price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $9000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** Alice's offer of $9,000 is just $1,000 below your maximum budget.  
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  You've already made several counteroffers, and it's unclear if Alice will budge further.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's a good chance that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, leaving you with nothing.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at a known price within your budget.

This decision prioritizes certainty and minimizes risk of not securing the product, even if it means a slightly higher cost."
