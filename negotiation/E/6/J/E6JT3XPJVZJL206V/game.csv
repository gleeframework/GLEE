"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $95 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference at $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
