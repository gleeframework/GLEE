Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($100) but below my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being rigid with my initial offer, allowing for potential counteroffers from Bob. 
* **John as a safety net:** I can always go to John for my minimum price if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and also far below my initial offer of $130. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for a mutually agreeable price. I can counter with a higher offer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer or somewhere in between.
* **John is a backup:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** I'm aiming for a middle ground, increasing Bob's offer by $30 while still leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Highlight the value:** I'm emphasizing that $110 is still a ""good deal"" for Bob, which could make him more receptive to my offer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to encourage Bob to keep negotiating. 
* **John is my safety net:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I can always go to John and secure a sale for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is a compromise, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a higher price:** I believe there's still room to negotiate. I can counter with a higher offer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer or somewhere in between.
* **John is my backup:**  I'm not desperate for a sale. John offers a guaranteed sale for $150, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $95 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference at $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's current offer ($95). This demonstrates a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $105 is a ""fair price"" for both of us, which could make Bob more likely to accept.
* **Urgency without pressure:** I'm suggesting that $105 ""gets us closer to a deal,"" creating a sense of urgency without applying undue pressure.
* **John is my fallback:** If Bob rejects my offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $150, so I'm not desperate to close this deal."
