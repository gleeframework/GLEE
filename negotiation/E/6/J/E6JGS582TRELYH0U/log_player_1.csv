Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,150,000 is significantly more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there is room for him to negotiate a lower price that is still profitable for you. 
* **It shows you're serious:** It's not a ridiculously low offer that might make Bob think you're not serious about selling.

This strategy allows you to potentially get a better price than John's offer while still being flexible enough to make a deal if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves less room for potential profit. It's worth trying to negotiate further by making a counteroffer. I believe I can still secure a higher price that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:** It signals that I'm not willing to settle for his low price.
* **Is still below my initial offer:** This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Is a reasonable compromise:** It's closer to the middle ground between our initial offers. 

This approach aims to reach a compromise that is acceptable to both parties without sacrificing too much of my potential profit."
