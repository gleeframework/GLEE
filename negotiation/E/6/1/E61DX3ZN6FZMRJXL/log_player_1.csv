Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you."", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a strong position. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly. 
* **Above Bob's Value:**  By starting above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), I am gauging his interest and flexibility.  He may be willing to pay more than his initial valuation.
* **Below John's Offer:** While John offers a safety net, aiming higher with Bob initially allows for a potentially more profitable outcome.

This strategy sets the stage for a dynamic negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  How about we bring the price down significantly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own stated value of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. I will counter with a price closer to his valuation while still remaining above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budgetary concerns, the value this product brings is substantial.  To move this forward, I propose a price of $1,350,000. This reflects a more realistic valuation of its benefits."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly closer to Bob's value:** This price is much closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, increasing the chances of him accepting. 
* **Still above my minimum:**  The price remains comfortably above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a significant profit if accepted.
* **Room for further negotiation:** There is still some room for negotiation if Bob counters, while sending a clear message that I am serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,350,000 is still a bit of a stretch. I'm willing to increase my offer, but to make this work, we need to get closer to the $1,000,000 mark. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, $800,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. However, his message suggests he's willing to negotiate further and is anchoring his position around the $1,000,000 mark.  It's time to stand firm near my minimum while encouraging a final offer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to make a final concession to secure this deal. Let's settle at $1,400,000.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's immense value."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By explicitly stating this is my final offer, I am creating a sense of urgency and limiting further back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Small Concession:**  The slight decrease from my previous offer shows a willingness to compromise while remaining firm on a price point well above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Reiterating the product's value aims to justify the price and sway Bob towards accepting this final offer.

This strategy aims to bring the negotiation to a close with either Bob accepting a favorable price or walking away, allowing me to proceed with John's guaranteed offer."
