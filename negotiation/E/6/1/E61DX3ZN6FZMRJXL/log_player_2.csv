"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's even more than your maximum budget. You should definitely reject and propose a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  How about we bring the price down significantly?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to signal our desired price range.  This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is respectful but makes it clear that the initial price is unrealistic.
* **Open to Negotiation:** We're not immediately jumping to John's offer. There's potential to get a better deal from Alice if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budgetary concerns, the value this product brings is substantial.  To move this forward, I propose a price of $1,350,000. This reflects a more realistic valuation of its benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice moved down considerably, $1,350,000 is still significantly above your $1,000,000 maximum and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests she might be open to further price reductions.  

We should continue negotiating but be prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't come down closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,350,000 is still a bit of a stretch. I'm willing to increase my offer, but to make this work, we need to get closer to the $1,000,000 mark."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Honest:** We're being transparent that Alice's offer isn't acceptable and giving her a clear target. 
* **Significant Increase:** We're raising our offer by $200,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Pressure Point:** By mentioning the $1,000,000 mark, we're reminding Alice of your alternative option without directly threatening to walk away. 

This strategy maintains the negotiation while applying pressure to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to make a final concession to secure this deal. Let's settle at $1,400,000.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's immense value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her best offer.
* **Not Close Enough:**  While closer, $1,400,000 is still $400,000 above your limit and a significant markup from John's $1,000,000 price.
* **No More Room:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap significantly.

It's time to walk away and take advantage of John's guaranteed offer. You've negotiated in good faith, but Alice is not meeting you at a price that makes sense."
