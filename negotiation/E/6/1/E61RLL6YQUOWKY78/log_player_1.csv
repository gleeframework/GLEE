"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above the minimum I'm willing to accept but also leaves room for negotiation. I'm hopeful that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close a deal, $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while staying firm on a price that's fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is my absolute minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will finally see the value in the product and accept this offer. If not, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
