"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $75. It's a great opportunity to get a valuable item at an attractive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $75 is below your maximum value of $80. Accepting the offer means you save $5 compared to buying from John.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal or ending up paying more."
