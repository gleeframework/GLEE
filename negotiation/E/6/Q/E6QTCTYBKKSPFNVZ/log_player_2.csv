"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this product, valued at $10000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Alice is selling for $9,000, while John wants $10,000. 
* **Even though the product is ""valued"" at $10,000 to Bob, that's not the actual price he's willing to pay.**  Bob's maximum is $10,000, so getting it for $9,000 is a good deal."
