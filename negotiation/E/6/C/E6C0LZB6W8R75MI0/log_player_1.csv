"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a good starting point while still leaving room to negotiate if necessary.  I'll see what Bob's response is before deciding whether to potentially sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $95. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still slightly lower than my desired price, I've already had three rounds of negotiation and it's getting close to the end.  Selling to Bob for $92 is better than selling to John for $80, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
