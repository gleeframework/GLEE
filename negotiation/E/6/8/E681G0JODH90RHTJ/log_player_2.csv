"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly unique and valuable product. While I can't disclose specifics just yet, I assure you it's worth well over $1500000 to me.  I'm open to negotiation, but my starting price is $2000000.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can find common ground.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1750000 is still below what I consider fair for this product.  Let's compromise: I'm willing to come down to $1850000.  This would be a win-win situation, as it's closer to your offer while still reflecting the true value of the product. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're close to a deal, but $1700000 just doesn't cover the true value of this product for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1775000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit.  Let's find a way to close this deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it.
