Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's high value without explicitly stating your minimum price. This allows you to potentially secure a price closer to your desired outcome.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning other interested parties (John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" signals to Bob that you're open to discussing the price.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a sense that a deal is possible."
