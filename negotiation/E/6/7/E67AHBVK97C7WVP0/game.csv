"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $800,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering you the product for $700,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $700,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $680,000. I believe this is a fair offer that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",680000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $680,000. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $690,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's the best deal you'll get from me.",690000.0,Alice,5,
