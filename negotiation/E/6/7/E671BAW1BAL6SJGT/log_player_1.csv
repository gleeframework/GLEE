Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to drop to $950,000 yet. I believe the product has more value than that. I will counteroffer Bob and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the product's worth.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below what I consider a fair price for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further but I need to ensure I receive at least $1,050,000. I'll counteroffer again and see where that leads."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to go down to $1,040,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1040000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,040,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,030,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm confident I can get a better price. I will counteroffer again and try to close the deal with Bob before considering selling to John."

Round 7

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are getting close to the end of the negotiations, and the price is still not meeting my minimum requirement. With only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal with Bob. I'll sell to John, ensuring I get my minimum desired price."
