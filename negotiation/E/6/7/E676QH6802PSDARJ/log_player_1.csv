I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's also a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring a fair return for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value. While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned that this process will take too long and I might not be able to reach a price that is acceptable to me.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to ensure a quick and profitable sale."
