"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It makes sense to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:** Bob's counteroffer of $12,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Show interest:** Bob emphasizes his interest in the product to avoid completely dismissing Alice's offer. 
* **Be realistic:** $12,000 is a reasonable starting point, considering Bob's maximum budget of $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 is my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $18,000 for a quick sale.  This product will truly benefit you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:**  Alice's offer of $18,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  There is still room for negotiation. Bob can try to counter with a lower offer, aiming to get closer to his budget. 
* **Avoiding immediate purchase:** Buying from John for $10,000 is a safe option, but Bob may be able to secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product and I believe $15,000 would be a fair price for both of us. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Approach:** Bob is steadily decreasing his counteroffer, showing Alice that he's serious about making a deal but also staying within his budget.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  Bob emphasizes the ""fairness"" of his offer, subtly suggesting a compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Progress Towards Budget:**  This counteroffer is within Bob's maximum budget ($10,000) and closer to Alice's ideal price ($15,000). It's a good point to see if Alice is willing to meet in the middle."
