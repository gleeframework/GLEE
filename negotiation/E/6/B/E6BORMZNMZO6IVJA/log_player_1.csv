Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  This is the minimum you're willing to accept â€“ $1,500,000 (since John will buy it at that price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** This is the range where a deal can happen. It exists if your reservation price is lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay. However, in this case, there isn't a ZOPA based on the initial numbers.

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer (John). To maximize your profit, you want to see if you can get Bob to pay a price closer to your reservation price, even though it exceeds his perceived value.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth in the current market."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair reflection"" add perceived value. 
* **No Mention of John:** Revealing your backup buyer weakens your position.

**Possible Outcomes**

1. **Bob Accepts:**  You get a great deal at $1,450,000.
2. **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter with a lower offer.  Be prepared to negotiate but hold firm to a price above your $1,500,000 reservation point.
3. **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000.

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't have time constraints. If you need to sell quickly, you might adjust your strategy."
