"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's worth exploring negotiation with Alice first to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a starting point for negotiation.  It's important to be aggressive in the early rounds to maximize the potential savings.  While I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000, I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my desired budget.  I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can get a price closer to $1,000,000.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's worth exploring negotiation with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still staying below Alice's latest offer,  hoping to meet somewhere in the middle.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup option with John, so I'm not under pressure to accept any price that's too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still a bit high.  I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can get a price closer to $1,000,000.  Buying from John is always an option, but I'm hoping to save some money by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price for the product. This is a strong signal that I'm serious about buying it, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer, as she's also likely to want to close the deal.  If she rejects it, I'll still have the option to buy from John, but I'm hoping to avoid that since it's my last resort."
