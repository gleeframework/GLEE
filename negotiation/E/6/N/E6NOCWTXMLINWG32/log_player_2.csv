"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your endeavors. I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a decent starting point, Bob can aim for a better price. There are 10 rounds to negotiate, and Bob can still buy from John if he doesn't get a satisfactory deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within a certain budget."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While $1,300,000 is closer to his ideal price, he can likely get it lower.  With 7 rounds left, there's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's aim for $1,250,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
