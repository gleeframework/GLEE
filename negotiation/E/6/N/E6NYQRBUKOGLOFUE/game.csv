"Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1250000. This price reflects the potential it holds, and I'm confident you'll see the same value.  Let me know your thoughts!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1250000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations.  While $900000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1050000 to bridge the gap.  This price still reflects the value I see in the product, but it's a more reasonable starting point for us to find common ground.  Let's keep this conversation going!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1000000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1025000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
