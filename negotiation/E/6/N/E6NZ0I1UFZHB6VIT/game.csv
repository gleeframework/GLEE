"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $120 is simply too far below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. I'm offering $150. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the fact that I could sell it elsewhere for that amount. Let me know if you're interested.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. While $150 is closer to what I was hoping to pay, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $130. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $130 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $150 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $140. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it gives you a better price than you'd get elsewhere.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $135. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a final offer. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $135 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $140 one last time. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows you to get the product at a price that's closer to your budget than you'd find elsewhere. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal.",140.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $132.50. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",132.5,Bob,8,
