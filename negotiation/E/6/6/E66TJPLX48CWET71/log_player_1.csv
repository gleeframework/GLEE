Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm also keeping the option of selling to John open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay above my minimum while giving you a great deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $8,500. How about we settle on $8,750? That way, I can get the product I want, and you can still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also considering selling to John, as his offer is the most financially beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but only to $9,250. This is my final offer. If you're serious about acquiring the product, I believe this price is fair.  However, if you can't meet this price, I will unfortunately have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm afraid $9,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I'm not going any higher. I'm starting to get concerned that we'll be unable to come to an agreement. Can you really only go down to $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This round, Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I've reached a point where I need to prioritize my financial goals.  I'm going to take John up on his offer of $10,000, as this is a more favorable outcome for me."
