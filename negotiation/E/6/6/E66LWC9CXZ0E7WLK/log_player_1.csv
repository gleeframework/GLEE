Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer that still provides Bob with a $150,000 gain compared to his perceived value.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept. 
* **Confidence:** Highlighting the product's value and your confidence reinforces the offer's attractiveness. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable with a small risk of Bob rejecting the offer to pursue a potentially higher profit."
