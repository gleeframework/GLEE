# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
