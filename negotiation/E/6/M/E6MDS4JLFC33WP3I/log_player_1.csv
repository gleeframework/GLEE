{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000, but also leaves room for negotiation.  It reflects that I believe the product is worth more than $8,000, and that I'm open to a deal, but also that I'm not desperate to sell for the minimum."
