{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to create a good rapport with Bob.
* **Open Ended Question:** I'm ending with an open ended question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation.

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation, while still ensuring I'm not giving away the product for less than my minimum value."
