"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $7,000 is better than John's price of $8,000, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $7,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $6,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,900. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $6,900 is a lower price than John's $8,000.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** We're already in Round 3, and there are limited rounds left. 
* **Potential for a stalemate:**  Further counteroffers might lead to a stalemate where Alice won't budge further, forcing us to buy from John anyway.

It's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and save $1,100 compared to buying from John."
