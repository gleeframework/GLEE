"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm aiming for a price around $1,400,000, but I'm open to discussing what might work best for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I understand your position, the value of this product is significant, and $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000? This seems like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
