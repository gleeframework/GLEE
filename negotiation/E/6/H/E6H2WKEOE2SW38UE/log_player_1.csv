Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

While I understand your position, the value of this product is significant, and $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?
