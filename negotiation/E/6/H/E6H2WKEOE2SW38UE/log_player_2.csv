"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm aiming for a price around $1,400,000, but I'm open to discussing what might work best for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,400,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can always buy from John, but it's more expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing that you're serious about saving money. However, it's not so low that it's immediately unreasonable. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  $1,200,000 is still within your budget and leaves space for Alice to counter with a higher price that you could potentially accept.
* **Building a Negotiation:** This counteroffer sets the stage for a back-and-forth. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate, but also your commitment to finding a price that works for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. While I understand your position, the value of this product is significant, and $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000? This seems like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise, splitting the difference between your previous counteroffer of $1,200,000 and her initial offer of $1,400,000. 
* **Value vs. Cost:** While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price ($1,500,000). 
* **Saving Money:** Accepting this offer saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good balance between getting a reasonable price and avoiding potential delays and complications."
