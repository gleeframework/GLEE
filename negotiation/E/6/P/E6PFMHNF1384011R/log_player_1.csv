{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for Bob, highlighting the potential for him to make a profit.  

**Why this approach:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:** This price allows for potential negotiation and maximizes my chances of getting closer to my desired price.
* **Sets a clear starting point:** This offer establishes a clear starting point for the negotiation. 
* **Encourages acceptance:** By offering a price below my minimum, I increase the likelihood that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's not even close to the value of the product to me.  I will reject this offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great price for you, considering you value the product at $1,200,000.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer. It reflects a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the potential for Bob to still make a profit with my counteroffer, framing it as a fair compromise. 

**Why this approach:**

* **Balances negotiation:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while maintaining my position. 
* **Creates pressure:**  This price puts pressure on Bob to consider a higher offer, as he might be hesitant to lose out on the potential profit. 
* **Avoids immediate selling:** By counteroffering, I avoid losing the negotiation and potentially selling to John for a lower price than I could potentially get from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe I can still push for a higher price and potentially get closer to my desired value. 

By rejecting his offer, I'm signaling that I'm not willing to settle for anything less than my minimum acceptable price. This will force Bob to reconsider and potentially come back with a higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,150,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still allows you to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer but still higher than Bob's latest offer, showing my willingness to negotiate while staying within my acceptable range.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise and highlighting the potential profit for Bob,  emphasizing that both parties can benefit from this deal.

**Why this approach:**

* **Maintains leverage:**  This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining leverage. 
* **Signals commitment:** It conveys my commitment to finding a fair agreement without conceding too much.
* **Increases the chance of a deal:**  The price is more reasonable for both parties, potentially leading to a successful negotiation.

This strategy aims to continue the negotiation while keeping my minimum acceptable price in mind, leading to a potential final agreement closer to my desired value."
