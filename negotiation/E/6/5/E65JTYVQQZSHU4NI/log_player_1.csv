Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I know you'd appreciate its value. I'm looking for a price of $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that you know Bob appreciates the product's value, you are subtly implying it might be worth more than he thinks.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone is friendly and encourages Bob to counter-offer rather than just saying ""yes"" or ""no."" 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John. 
* **Bob's Perspective:** Keep in mind Bob will only buy if he sees value at or above your asking price."
