"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is too high.  You are willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, so it's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $11,000 is still higher than your maximum limit. It's worth pushing for a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've got to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $10,500 is still above your maximum price point. You are better off pushing for your desired $10,000 in the next round. You have the option to purchase from John for that price, so it's worth trying to get Alice down to your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a fair profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're serious about buying the product. However, I've got to think about my own needs and goals. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, $10,250 is still slightly higher than your limit. You have two rounds left, and there's a good chance Alice might be willing to drop to your desired $10,000. You can also always go to John if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident we can find a win-win solution.  Let's close this deal at $10,000, which would be a fair price for both of us.  It would be a shame to miss this opportunity due to a small difference."", ""product_price"": 10000}
