"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some profit for you.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which still gives you a good deal. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is closer to my value and still gives you a decent profit.  Let's find a middle ground here.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's finalize this and move forward. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come closer to our target prices. Let's close this deal!",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,400, which is a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal. It's a win-win situation for both of us!  Let's finalize this and move forward.",9400.0,Alice,7,
