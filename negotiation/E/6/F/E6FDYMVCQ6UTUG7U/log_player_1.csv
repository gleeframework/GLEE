"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the deal and accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would still be a good deal for you considering the value you've stated, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $11,000 is a reasonable compromise and a decent profit margin. I'm going to accept Bob's offer to avoid potentially going through more rounds of negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
