"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $10500 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $11500. This would still be a good deal for you considering the value you've stated, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a compromise here.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,
