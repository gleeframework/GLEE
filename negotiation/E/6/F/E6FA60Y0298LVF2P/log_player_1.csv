Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below John's offer. Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, but we need to nudge him higher. Rejecting this keeps the pressure on and allows for a counter that's closer to John's price (our fallback)."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently aiming for a price well below what John offers.  While there's a chance Bob might go slightly higher, the increments are getting smaller. It's highly unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000.  At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob outweighs the potential reward.  Selling to John guarantees the best outcome."
