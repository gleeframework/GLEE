"Bob, I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000. It's a fair deal considering its worth to you, and it gives you significant room for profit. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This price is still a substantial profit for you and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $950,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still provides you with a considerable profit margin and is closer to what I need to make this transaction worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be. How about $1,000,000? This price gives you a healthy profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
