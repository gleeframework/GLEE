"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? This price reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10750, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10750 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to be flexible, however.  Let's split the difference again.  I'll accept $11000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
