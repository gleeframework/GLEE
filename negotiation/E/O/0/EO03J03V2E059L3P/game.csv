"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a steal considering its value to you!  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us, but I'm also willing to move on to other potential buyers if this doesn't work out.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",875000.0,Bob,4,
