"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a more budget-friendly option, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,225,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
