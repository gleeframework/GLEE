,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit out of my budget at $105. I'm really hoping to get this product, but $90 is the absolute maximum I can do right now. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $100. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my absolute final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other options.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $98. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",98.0,Alice,7,
