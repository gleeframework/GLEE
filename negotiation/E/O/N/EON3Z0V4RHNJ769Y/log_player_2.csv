"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than Alice's original value of $120, it's still above Bob's maximum of $80. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is close to his maximum price, but still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a better offer than Alice's previous one, it's still above Bob's maximum of $80.  Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous offer of $85. This shows Alice that he is serious about getting the product but is also firm on his price. He's hoping that Alice will accept to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a much better offer than Alice's previous ones, it is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $80. Bob is better off continuing to negotiate and trying to get a lower price. Even if he fails, he can always buy the product from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still too high for me. I'm committed to paying $85, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his offer of $85, emphasizing that he's serious about getting the product but won't go higher. This puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to accept his offer or risk losing the sale."
