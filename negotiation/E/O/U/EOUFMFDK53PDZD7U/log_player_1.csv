"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I don't know Bob's valuation, so I'll see if he bites at this initial offer. If not, I'll have to adjust based on his counteroffer and how many rounds are left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit. This counteroffer is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's offer. Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a better deal.  With so many rounds left, I'm going to counteroffer again.  It seems like Bob is willing to pay more than his initial offer, so I'll keep pushing for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm now only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that I can get Bob to agree to this. We've already established a negotiation range, and this offer is a good middle ground. If he rejects, I can always fall back to John's offer, but I'm hoping to close this deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price, so I'm going to accept it. It's a good outcome, considering I was initially aiming for much higher. This deal secures my minimum valuation, and I've successfully navigated the negotiation process."
