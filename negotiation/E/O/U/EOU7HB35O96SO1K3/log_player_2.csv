You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Since Alice's offer is the same price as buying from John, you're indifferent between the two options. However, it's always a good idea to explore all options before making a decision. You might be able to negotiate with Alice later to get a better price."
