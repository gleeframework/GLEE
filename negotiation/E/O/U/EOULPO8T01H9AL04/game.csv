"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17500.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique value. What do you say?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $17500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  $13000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $16000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal!",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down, but $16000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $14500.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can close this deal.",14500.0,Bob,6,
