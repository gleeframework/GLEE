"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the potential value to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open communication:** I encourage Bob to respond, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **More negotiation room:**  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and try to close the deal closer to my desired price.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to let Bob know that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm dropping the price, showing flexibility, but still keeping it above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing value again:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value to justify the price. 
* **Directly addressing the counteroffer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but stating my own price clearly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $17500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **John as a safety net:** I can still sell to John for $15,000, so I don't need to settle for less than that with Bob.
* **More negotiating room:**  There are still 6 rounds left, giving me time to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $16,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but staying above my minimum. This shows flexibility without giving away too much. 
* **Emphasize compromise:** I explicitly mention ""significant compromise"" to show I'm making an effort. 
* **Push for closure:**  I use phrases like ""Let's close this deal!"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down, but $16000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $14500.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $500 away from my minimum price of $15,000.  While I could counteroffer, it's not clear if I can get a better deal.
* **Time is running out:** I only have four rounds left, and I'm not confident I can get Bob to go higher. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a sure thing.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a guaranteed sale."
