"I have a unique opportunity to sell you a high-end product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial deal.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable price.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price. However, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $9,000? I'm trying to be realistic here.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not meeting in the middle. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me. To be completely honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $10,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've found a similar product elsewhere, but I'm confident that mine is of higher quality and value. I'm willing to meet your price, but I need to make up for the difference. I'm counteroffering at $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. I've thought about it carefully, and I'm willing to offer you $10,000, but that's truly the most I can do.  It's a fair offer considering the market, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you're agreeable.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000, but I'm still not making a profit. I'm willing to make one last compromise, but I need to get at least $10,500. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,9,
