"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is too high. It's better to reject and counter-offer to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I could come down to $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my limit. I'll reject and try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to make one final offer to try and find a middle ground. How about $980,000? This is my absolute best price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

Alice's final offer of $980,000 is still above my ideal price, but it's within my budget and closer to what I'm willing to pay. It's worth taking this deal rather than risking further negotiation or buying from John at $800,000."
