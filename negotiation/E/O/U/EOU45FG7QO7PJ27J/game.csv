"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800000. Let's discuss this further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but based on my valuation of the product, I am unable to agree to $1400000. Considering my maximum budget of $800000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. I hope we can come to an agreement that is fair for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product. How about $1250000? This still leaves a significant margin for you considering your valuation and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's find a way to make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While $1250000 is a step in the right direction, I still believe we can find a price closer to my valuation. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1150000. I understand this is still above my maximum budget, but I believe it is a fair compromise given the value of the product to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1150000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the value you see in this opportunity. Let's finalize this deal and make it happen.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your efforts in coming down on the price. However, I must respectfully decline at $1300000. Given my valuation of the product, I would like to propose one final counteroffer of $1200000. This remains above my ideal budget, but I believe it is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your final offer. While $1200000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a price closer to the product's true value. Given the potential benefits this product holds for you, I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it for $1400000. This price reflects the value I place on this opportunity and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
