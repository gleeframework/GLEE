"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know your thoughts!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product. Let's keep the conversation going, and hopefully we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,200 simply isn't enough for me to sell this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,700. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great value for the product. What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8,700 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Can you consider this price?",8500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I need to get at least $8,600 for this product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great value for the product. Let's make a deal and get this done.",8600.0,Alice,7,
