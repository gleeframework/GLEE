"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I have 8 rounds left, and John is a guaranteed sale at $10,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product. Let's keep the conversation going, and hopefully we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I've already lowered my offer twice and still have 6 rounds left.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go higher.  Selling to John is still the backup plan if we don't reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,200 simply isn't enough for me to sell this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,700. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great value for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8,700 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough. I've already lowered my offer twice, and I have 4 rounds left.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price. Selling to John is still the backup plan if we don't reach a deal, but I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I need to get at least $8,600 for this product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great value for the product. Let's make a deal and get this done."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $8,600 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,400. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the last two rounds. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I am unsure if he will budge further.  Selling to John at $10,000 guarantees me a higher price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
