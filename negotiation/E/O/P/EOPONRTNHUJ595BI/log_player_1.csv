Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, aiming for the majority of the potential surplus.  It also leaves room for negotiation, considering Bob's valuation is $1,000,000. This is a good starting point, but I'll be ready to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering the price slightly to $900,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate, but still leaves a significant gap between my offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this will encourage further negotiation and potentially lead to a mutually acceptable price."
