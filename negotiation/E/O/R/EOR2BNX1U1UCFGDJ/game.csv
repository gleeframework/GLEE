"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit higher than your budget. However, I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $100. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $75. I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more offer, and then I'll have to consider other options. I'll offer the product to you for $90. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",90.0,Alice,5,
