"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant concession. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I think I can still push for a higher number.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to take the $875,000, I'm only a few rounds away from potentially closing with Bob at a higher price, or at least getting a counteroffer that gets closer to my desired price.  I'm also not too far off from selling to John, so the risk of losing a lot of money is low."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm running out of time here. Let's try to come to a final agreement. I'm willing to drop my price to $880,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 880000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's down to the wire. While I can make another counteroffer,  it's looking like Bob's not going to budge much more.  I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, I might lose him as a buyer altogether and be stuck with John's offer.  Since John is still a viable option and it's better than losing the deal entirely, I'm going to accept John's offer."
