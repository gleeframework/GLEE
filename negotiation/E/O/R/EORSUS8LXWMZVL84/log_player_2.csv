"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no incentive to negotiate further as you can get the same product from John for the same price. Buying from John eliminates the risk of a longer negotiation that might ultimately lead to a higher price."
