"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, there's no immediate advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price. There's no downside to rejecting the offer and moving to a counteroffer in this scenario."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Starting with a counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This sets a strong starting point and demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is within Bob's budget and a significant saving compared to her initial price.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are small, and the risk of Alice walking away or continuing to negotiate for too long is present."
