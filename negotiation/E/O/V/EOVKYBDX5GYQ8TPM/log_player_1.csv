"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also framing the product as valuable to me, hoping to build up Bob's desire to have it.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'd like to propose a price of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $102? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102}
```

I'm taking a more moderate approach this time, acknowledging Bob's offer while still holding firm on my desire for a higher price.  Meeting halfway might make him more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done some research and found that the market value for this product is closer to $90. I would like to propose a price of $95, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price.  I believe that I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $98. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would avoid the need for further back and forth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still above Bob's proposal. This shows good faith and a desire to reach a deal, while still leaving some room for potential negotiation in the next round."
