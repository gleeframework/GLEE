"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more along the lines of $12000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16000? This would still allow me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive. Let me know what you think!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $14000? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
