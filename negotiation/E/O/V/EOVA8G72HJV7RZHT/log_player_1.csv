Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more along the lines of $12000. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
