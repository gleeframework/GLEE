"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally good practice to begin negotiations with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite and Respectful:**  Maintaining a positive and professional tone throughout the negotiation is important for a successful outcome.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $700,000, we're positioning ourselves well below Alice's starting point but still leaving a substantial gap to negotiate. This gives us room to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $900,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you consider $750,000? That would work much better for my budget."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:**  We're moving in smaller increments now to show Alice that we're serious about reaching a deal but also standing firm on our budget constraints.
* **Seeking Compromise:** Offering $750,000 demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise that works for both parties.
* **Maintaining Distance from John's Price:** We want to avoid moving too close to John's $800,000 offer too quickly, as it reduces our leverage with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting very close to John's price, but Alice is still showing a willingness to negotiate. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can secure a slightly better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make my final offer at $775,000. This represents a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is valuable."",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By explicitly stating this is our final offer, we're adding a sense of urgency and signaling to Alice that we're reaching the limit of our flexibility.
* **Midpoint Compromise:**  $775,000 is a compromise between our previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing her we are willing to meet in the middle.
* **Alternative Option:**  By this point, Alice knows we have the option to go with John at $800,000, so making a reasonable final offer slightly below that price increases the chances of her accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $825,000. I believe this is the best price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go below $825,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to take John's offer of $800,000.  While we might be able to squeeze a few more thousand out of Alice, the difference is minimal and not worth the risk of prolonged negotiations, especially since we have a guaranteed alternative."
