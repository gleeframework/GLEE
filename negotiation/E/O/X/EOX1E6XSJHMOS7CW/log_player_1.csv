Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. It also shows I believe in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

$1,000,000 is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away this product for a loss. I'll counteroffer and see where we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm coming down to $1,750,000, which is still a significant profit for me. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a decent price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$1,250,000 is still too low. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not quite there yet. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm coming down again to $1,600,000, which is closer to Bob's offer.  This shows I'm trying to find a middle ground while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I would love to make more than $1,500,000, I'm starting to feel like this negotiation with Bob is going to be very difficult. He seems very firm on his price. I'm comfortable selling to John and getting a guaranteed profit."
