# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $12,000. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high.  I'm not willing to pay more than $10,000.  I'll reject her offer and see if we can get closer."
