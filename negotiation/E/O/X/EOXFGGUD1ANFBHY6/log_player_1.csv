{""product_price"": 170}

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum than Bob's valuation. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  It also sets the tone that I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility but staying above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not quite there. While I could continue negotiating, it's taking time and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'm choosing to sell to John for $150, which is my minimum and ensures I get a good deal."
