"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at $200. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $160? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. I would like to counter with an offer of $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $140 is a reasonable outcome in this situation.  It's a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away."
