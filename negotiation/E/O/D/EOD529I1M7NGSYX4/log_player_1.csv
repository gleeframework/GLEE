Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** Starting at $140 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Psychology:** Offering a price slightly below the ""round number"" of $150 might make it seem more appealing to Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he rejects the initial price."
