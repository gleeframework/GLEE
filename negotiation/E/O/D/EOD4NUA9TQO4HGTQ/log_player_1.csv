Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:**  Bob values the product at $120, so that's the absolute maximum he'd pay.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $100 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $115 leaves some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal (saving $5) while still getting you close to the maximum potential profit. 

This strategy aims to secure a sale with Bob at a favorable price, avoiding the need to sell to John at a lower price."
