"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $1,500,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something lower. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't accept such a large difference from the product's value.  My final offer is $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair and firm offer, reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering. ",1300000.0,Alice,5,
