"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the last round, and I'm still not sure if we can meet on a price. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product, which is the same as my previous offer. Can you consider this price?",135.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $145, Bob. I'm starting to think we're at an impasse. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package that's normally worth $20, absolutely free. This is my final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $145.",145.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate the extra service package, but I'm still not willing to pay $145. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, and I'd like to take you up on the premium service package if I buy it at this price. Can you consider this price?",130.0,Bob,10,
