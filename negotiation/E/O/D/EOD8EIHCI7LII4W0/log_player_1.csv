"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This is my opening offer to Bob.  I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth more to him. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also aware of the possibility that he may reject it and I'll need to adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price so early in the negotiation. I believe I can get a better price with some further negotiation. I'm confident I can secure a higher price if I continue the dialogue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
