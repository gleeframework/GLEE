"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $14,000. I believe this offer represents a fair deal given its value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $13,000 for the product.  This price is still fair considering the value we both place on it."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider $13,750? It's a compromise that brings us closer to a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $13,750 is still lower than John's price of $15,000. 
* **Little room for further negotiation:**  Alice has already moved closer to Bob's desired price, making further negotiation risky. 
* **Avoiding risk:**  Bob could potentially get a lower price with further negotiation, but there's also a risk Alice might reject his counteroffer and he'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice, as it secures a good price while minimizing risk."
