"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us and allows for a profitable transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and allows me to recoup some of my costs. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us and will allow us to both walk away happy. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
