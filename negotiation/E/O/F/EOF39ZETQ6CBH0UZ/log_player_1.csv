"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still being a good starting point for me. I'm confident that the product is worth this to him, and I'm hoping to secure a higher price than my minimum of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. Hopefully, this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to give away the product for a huge loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, though it's getting closer. I'll counteroffer again, trying to inch closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm offering $15,500. This is a compromise - it's above Bob's last offer, but still lower than my initial asking price.  With only 5 rounds left, I want to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we are already in round 6. I'm worried we won't reach a deal with him, and with John offering a guaranteed $15,000, it's the safer choice to sell to him."
