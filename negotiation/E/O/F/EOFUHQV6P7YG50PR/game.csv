"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for your product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $17000?  It's a good deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $14000. How about $15500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",15500.0,Alice,5,
