"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get closer to his desired $10,000 price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his $10,000 target. Starting with a counteroffer of $10,500 is a reasonable first step. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $12,000. While Bob might be able to squeeze out another few hundred dollars, it's important to consider the risk of further negotiation.  If Alice rejects the offer, she might increase her price or stall the deal. 

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with and avoids potentially losing the deal or wasting more time."
