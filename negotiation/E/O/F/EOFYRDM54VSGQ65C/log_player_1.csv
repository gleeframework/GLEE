"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but to show I'm serious about finding a fair deal, I'll come up to $1,280,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering its potential worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. How about we try to meet in the middle again at $1,230,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently trying to anchor the price lower. While $1,230,000 is a good profit, we're still early in the negotiation and Alice can likely push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to meet me closer to my price point.  I'm willing to accept $1,260,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1260000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to signal firmness to Bob. By stating this is Alice's final offer, she creates a sense of urgency and implies she's willing to walk away if he doesn't take it. This approach balances a desire for a higher price with the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,235,000. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,235,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,235,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob didn't fully meet Alice's ""final offer,"" $1,235,000 is a strong price. Bob has also presented his ""final counteroffer,"" increasing the likelihood that he will walk away if Alice rejects it. Accepting secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
