"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price. You can potentially save more by negotiating further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation, while still being within your budget. It also demonstrates your willingness to negotiate seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is better than her previous one, but it's still above your ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get the price down further by making another counteroffer.  It's worth exploring whether you can get closer to your target of $9,500 before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $9,875?  This would give us both a good deal and avoid further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 9875}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to meet Alice halfway.  It's just slightly above your initial counteroffer, making it seem like a realistic and reasonable compromise. It also emphasizes the benefit of reaching a deal to avoid further negotiation."
