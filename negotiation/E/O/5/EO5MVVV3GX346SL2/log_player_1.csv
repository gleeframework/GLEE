Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to part with it for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob is amenable. Bob gets a $50,000 discount from its true value to him, and I make a $50,000 profit above John's offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, allowing for a potential agreement somewhere between $950,000 and $1,000,000."
