I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Alice is willing to come down a bit further."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target. While I'd love to get it even lower, I've gone through several rounds and am running out of time. $8,900 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for $15,000."
