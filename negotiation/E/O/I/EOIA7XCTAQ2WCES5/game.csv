"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. It's significantly below the value of the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $850,000? It's still a good compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
