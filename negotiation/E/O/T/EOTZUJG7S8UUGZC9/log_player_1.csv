Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. I believe the product's value is worth a lot to me, but I'm not sure it's worth $20000. Can you consider a price reduction to $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
