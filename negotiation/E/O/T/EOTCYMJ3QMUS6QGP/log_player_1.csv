Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but one that's still higher than Bob's."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not quite there yet at $8,800.  Let's split the difference and close this deal at $8,900.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move on to the next step.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}

This is getting a bit too close to the end of the rounds and Bob doesn't seem willing to move much further. I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000 to avoid risking getting a lower price."
