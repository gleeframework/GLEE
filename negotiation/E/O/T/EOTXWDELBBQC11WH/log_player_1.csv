{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Being friendly:**  A friendly message makes Bob more receptive.
* **Highlighting value:**  Mentioning the product's potential benefits for Bob increases its perceived worth.
* **Setting a price above your minimum:**  $175 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you get more than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $140, but that's my final offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject it and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $160 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $150,  which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
