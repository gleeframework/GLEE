"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $140, but that's my final offer. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,
