Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,300,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment. Please let me know your decision as soon as possible."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he would theoretically be willing to pay anything up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 from John, so you don't want to go below that.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. This price also aims to capture a larger portion of the value Bob places on the product."
