"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $800,000, and I believe I can get closer to my target value with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your position, $900,000 is still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I'm trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm also willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm still within the early stages of the negotiation, and I believe I can secure a better price with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and your desire to get the best deal.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $935,000 for the product. This is a good compromise that allows us both to come away feeling satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 935000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $930,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my original target, I've reached a point where further negotiation might be risky.  $930,000 is just above my minimum price, and the potential of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $800,000 is a significant risk. I'll accept Bob's offer."
