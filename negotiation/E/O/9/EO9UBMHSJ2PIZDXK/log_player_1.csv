{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.  $50 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a more reasonable price than my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough for me. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $160. This is still a decent profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible. I hope this will be enough to convince him to buy."
