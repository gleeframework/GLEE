Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer, as it is significantly below my desired price point. I will counteroffer him with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  how about $850,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000. How about $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is the maximum value he's willing to pay, and it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price.  I'll accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a sale to John, which would result in a lower profit for me."
