Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product from John for a much lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500? I'm confident you'll find it's worth that investment.

You have three options:

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's budget. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? This allows me to get closer to my desired price while still offering you a significant discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can get the product for a lower price from John, so it's the best option for him."
