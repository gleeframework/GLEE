"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500? I'm confident you'll find it's worth that investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high. My final offer is $9,500.  This is a fair price that considers your value and my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? This allows me to get closer to my desired price while still offering you a significant discount.",10500.0,Alice,5,
