Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is going to start by making a counteroffer at his maximum budget of $8,000. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to walk away if necessary. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob knows he can always buy from John for $8,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is still slightly above Bob's ideal price.  There's still room to negotiate further, and Bob has the option to purchase from John for $8,000 if he can't get a lower price. It's worth rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a better deal."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,850 is only $850 over Bob's maximum budget from John.  It's worth accepting this offer. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge or that he might lose the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures that Bob gets the product at a price that is within his budget and avoids the risk of losing out on the opportunity."
