"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $850,000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 just isn't feasible for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and lets us move forward.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand where you're coming from.  To be honest, $775,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we try $740,000? That would work much better for me.",740000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still interested in working with you. How about $760,000? It's a good compromise for both of us, and we can close the deal. ",760000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit at $750,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $755,000. That's a small step closer to my desired price, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this.",755000.0,Alice,7,
