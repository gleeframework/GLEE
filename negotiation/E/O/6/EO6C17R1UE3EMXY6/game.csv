"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,250,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I can offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,7,
