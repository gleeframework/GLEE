"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105?  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is too low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $97 is still a little low for me, but I'm flexible.  Let's split the difference and go with $101.  I think that's a good price for both of us.",101.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle at $99?  It's a small difference, but it would really help me out.",99.0,Bob,6,
