"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above the middle point between my minimum value and what I know the product is worth to Bob. This allows some room for negotiation, and also shows that I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is more than my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105?  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $90 is too low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$97 is still below my desired value, but it's getting closer. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $97 is still a little low for me, but I'm flexible.  Let's split the difference and go with $101.  I think that's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 101}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle at $99?  It's a small difference, but it would really help me out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, it's getting close to the end of the rounds. Accepting Bob's offer of $99 is a good deal, and better than selling to John for $80."
