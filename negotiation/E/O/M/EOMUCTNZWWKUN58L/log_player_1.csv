{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to my desired outcome ($15,000) than John's offer of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Opening:** $13,000 is still within a reasonable range for Bob, considering he values the product at $15,000. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm open to discussion and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** While $11,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $10,000. This indicates there's room for further negotiation with Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's a chance I can secure a price closer to my ideal range of $13,000-$15,000 by making a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Selling to John for $10,000 would be a loss for me at this point, as I'm confident I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm definitely interested in working with you.  However, $11,000 is a bit lower than I can do right now. Would you be willing to come up to $12,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still within my desired range. This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance on my value.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  My message highlights that the offer is ""fair for both of us,"" which is a common tactic to encourage acceptance.
* **Maintain Pressure:** The counteroffer maintains pressure on Bob without pushing him away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. Can we make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is very close to my minimum desired price of $10,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Further negotiation could result in a lower offer from Bob, or even a rejection that would force me to sell to John for $10,000. 
* **Securing Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit of $1,500, which is a good outcome considering the potential for a lower price or rejection."
