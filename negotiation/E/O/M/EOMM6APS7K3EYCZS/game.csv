"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is as high as you're willing to go, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $115. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",115.0,Alice,5,
