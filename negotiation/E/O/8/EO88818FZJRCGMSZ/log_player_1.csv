Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we don't want to sell ourselves short. Starting with a price closer to our own valuation leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Negotiation Space:** Offering $1,300,000 allows Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal if we settle closer to his valuation. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
