"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation. You should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Expresses Interest:**  It shows Alice you're serious about buying, but not at any cost.
* **Offers a Reasonable Price:** $70 is a significant drop from $90, but still a profitable price for Alice (remember, it's worth $80 to her).
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  By starting lower, you give yourself space to potentially meet in the middle if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $70 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but we're still not at a price that reflects a significant saving compared to John's offer. Let's see if we can push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows Willingness to Compromise:** By suggesting the middle ground, you signal to Alice that you're serious about finding an agreement.
* **Keeps the Negotiation Moving:**  It prevents a stalemate and encourages Alice to respond with another counteroffer.
* **Still Below John's Price:**  Even if Alice rejects this and you have to go with John, you've still tried to get a better deal."
