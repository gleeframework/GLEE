,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm hoping for something closer to $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is a bit out of my budget. How about $975,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $975,000 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $987,500? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal here.",987500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $987,500 is still below what I'm hoping for. Let's aim for a final compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,012,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer: $990,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,8,
