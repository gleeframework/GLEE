Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's still fair for both of us. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is higher than your minimum price of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him a good deal and increasing the chance of acceptance.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always lower the price a bit to see if he'll change his mind."
