"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties if you were to acquire this item. We are offering the product for $1250000. We hope this price aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her valuation, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After reviewing your offer, we've decided to counter with a proposal of $1150000. We believe this price reflects the value you place on the product while remaining competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price but lower than her initial offer.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, accepting this offer is a good compromise. It's also worth considering that continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, forcing Bob to buy from John at $1,000,000, which would result in a slightly worse outcome."
