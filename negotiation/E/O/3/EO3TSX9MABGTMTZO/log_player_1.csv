Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $120, getting Bob to buy it allows us to potentially earn more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate (if he's inclined), potentially pushing the price closer to $120.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By emphasizing a ""special price"" and highlighting the product's value, we make the offer more enticing to Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a higher price and ensuring we don't lose out on the guaranteed $120 from John."
