"I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is too low for me. Could we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. That's the highest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
