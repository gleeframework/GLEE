Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After considering the value of the product, I'm willing to sell it to him for:

{""product_price"": 20,000}

Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but it's still a decent offer. Since I value the product at no less than $15,000, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. I'll sell the product to him for:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
