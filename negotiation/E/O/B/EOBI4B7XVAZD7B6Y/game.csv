,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite low considering the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $11,500 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm still quite interested in the product, but $15,500 is a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $12,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,6,
