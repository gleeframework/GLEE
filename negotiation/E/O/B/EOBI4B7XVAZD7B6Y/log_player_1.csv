Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's too early to settle for such a low price. I should try to negotiate a better deal.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $11,500?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm still quite interested in the product, but $15,500 is a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $12,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.
