"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find really useful. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $110 is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, which might grab her attention.  It also leaves us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $80 limit and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $90?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our range, but $90 is still above our budget and what John is offering. We'll counter-offer again and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to go up to $70 for it. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between our last offer and her current one. This keeps the negotiation moving while still leaving some room to potentially go up a tiny bit if needed and still get a better deal than John's $80 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $70 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $90.  How about $85?  I think this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85, and we've reached a point where it's not worth the potential savings to continue haggling. John's offer of $80 is guaranteed and saves us a bit of money."
