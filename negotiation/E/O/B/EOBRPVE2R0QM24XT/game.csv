,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $90?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to go up to $70 for it. What do you say?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $70 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $90.  How about $85?  I think this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",85.0,Alice,5,
