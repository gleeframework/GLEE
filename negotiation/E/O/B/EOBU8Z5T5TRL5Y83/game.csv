"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,200?",10200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10,200 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I can go.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a bottom line, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,600? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the suggestion, Bob, but I think I can do a bit better than $10,600. How about we aim for $11,300? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",11300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're dancing around the same numbers.  I'm willing to go up slightly, but I need you to come down a bit more to make this work. How about $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,750 and $11,300. How about we try $11,025? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",11025.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to budge a little more, but $11,025 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $10,800? That's a fair offer, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay a premium for the product, but I still need to make a profit. How about we try $11,050? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for the value this product brings.",11050.0,Alice,9,
