"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $1,250,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth significantly more, and I'm willing to compromise slightly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This price is fair and reflects the true value of the product.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we try $1,060,000?  It's a fair offer considering my constraints.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,060,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while respecting your budget. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting closer.  What about splitting the difference and doing $1,080,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
