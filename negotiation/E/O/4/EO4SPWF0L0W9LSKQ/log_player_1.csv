This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a small margin to bargain while still ensuring a profit for you.  It's important to be confident and clear in your communication."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $1,250,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price.  It's better to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth significantly more, and I'm willing to compromise slightly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This price is fair and reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we try $1,060,000?  It's a fair offer considering my constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly below your desired price. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a higher price.  You have a solid alternative buyer in John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,060,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while respecting your budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting closer.  What about splitting the difference and doing $1,080,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price, and you've already made several concessions.  It's getting close, but you have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum price.  It's time to move on and sell to John."
