Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that your asking price is justified. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal to Bob that you're open to negotiation and value his input.

While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it immediately. This strategy aims to test that while still having John as a guaranteed backup buyer."
