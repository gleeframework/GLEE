I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $9,000 is better than John's offer, I'm hoping I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500.  This is a compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and it's significantly better than selling to John.  I'm going to accept his offer."
