Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation if he counters.  I'm confident I can get a price closer to my target of $15,000, but I want to start high to see if I can maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and selling to John would result in the same profit.  It's more efficient to close the deal now and avoid further negotiation."
