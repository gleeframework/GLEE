"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a lower price.  $500000 is unfortunately below what I can accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $700000.  This still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Alice,3,
