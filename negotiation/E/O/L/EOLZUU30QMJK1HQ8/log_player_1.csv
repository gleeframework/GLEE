Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or going with John's guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. It's not worth accepting such a low price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. This price is also above my minimum acceptable value, so I'm not taking a significant loss. If Bob rejects this offer again, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is now above my minimum value of $12,000. While it's still lower than my initial asking price, it's getting closer and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiations. This ensures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer again or me losing time with further rounds of negotiation."
