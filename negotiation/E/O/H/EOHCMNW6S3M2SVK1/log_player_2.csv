"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000 to start. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his budget of $10,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below my asking price. Let's find a middle ground. How about $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John, so he has room to bargain."
