"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,
