I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a decent markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. I'm also leaving room for negotiation if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While I'm happy with $12,000, I'd prefer to get more if possible. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully shows I'm willing to be flexible while still wanting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John is offering, and closer to my desired price. I'll accept his offer and move on."
