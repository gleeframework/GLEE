{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

Bob is now making his final offer. He's willing to pay his maximum price, but only if Alice is willing to meet him there. This is a high-stakes move, as he could risk losing the deal altogether. However, it's also a strong stance that shows Bob's commitment to getting the best price possible.  He's prepared to walk away if Alice rejects this offer."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,050.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is only $50 above Bob's maximum, he's already shown his commitment to buying the product for $10,000.  There's a good chance that Alice won't budge further.  It's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John at his target price rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a higher cost."
