"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point.",850000.0,Bob,4,
