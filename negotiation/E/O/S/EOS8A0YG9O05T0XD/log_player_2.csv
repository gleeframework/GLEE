"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit. It's important to keep negotiating to try and get a price that works for me.  I'll counter with a lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 850000}
