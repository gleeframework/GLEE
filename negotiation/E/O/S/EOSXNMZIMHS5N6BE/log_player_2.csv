"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $120. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower price than what I'm willing to pay to give Alice room to negotiate.  This counteroffer is also within my budget and is a fair starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still above my maximum budget of $120.  I can get the product for the same price from John, so I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  That's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by $5, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate. This is still within my budget and gives us a good chance of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $115 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit off.  How about $120? That's my final price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is now within my budget and matches the price John is willing to sell it for. It's a good deal for me and saves me the effort of further negotiation."
