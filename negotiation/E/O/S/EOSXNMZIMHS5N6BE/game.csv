"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  That's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $115 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit off.  How about $120? That's my final price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
