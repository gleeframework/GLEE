"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'll sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You know the product is worth $80 to her, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the willingness to negotiate.  However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87.50 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above the value you're aiming for.  There's still room to negotiate a lower price.  You can try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $86.  This is a fair price that considers the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 86}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $86. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to meet you at $88. It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering $88. While this is still higher than your ideal price, it's getting closer to your limit, and you're running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer is the best strategy at this point. You'll save $12 compared to buying from John."
