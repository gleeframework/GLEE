,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the willingness to negotiate.  However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $86.  This is a fair price that considers the value of the product for both of us.",86.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $86. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to meet you at $88. It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I think it's a good compromise.",88.0,Alice,5,
