"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer of $9,000, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a strong starting point for negotiation. While it's unlikely Alice will accept this price immediately, it pushes for a more favorable outcome for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is now within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting and potentially increasing the price again, or even running out of rounds, makes accepting the offer the most strategic choice."
