Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, I still believe it's worth more than $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,125,000 is still a bit high. I'm ready to close the deal at $1,075,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to close the deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's target price. While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, the risk of not reaching an agreement is increasing.  It's more prudent for Bob to accept John's offer of $1,000,000 and secure the product at a lower price, ensuring he stays within his budget."
