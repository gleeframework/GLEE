"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it will be equally valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, a price that I believe is fair and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe $1,100,000 is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's close this deal at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's try to find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $950,000 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the unique value of this product. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as it aligns with my budget. I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
