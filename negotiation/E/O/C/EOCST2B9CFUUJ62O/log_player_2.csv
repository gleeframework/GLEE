"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it will be equally valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above what Bob is willing to pay.  It's wise to reject and start negotiating. There are 10 rounds, giving ample opportunity to find a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, a price that I believe is fair and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe $1,100,000 is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's close this deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, potentially leading to a more favorable price in future rounds.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is still a viable option, but it's worth exploring if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $950,000 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the unique value of this product. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's still room for negotiation.  John's offer remains a viable option, but it's worth exploring if Alice will come down further. Rejecting and continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as it aligns with my budget. I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
