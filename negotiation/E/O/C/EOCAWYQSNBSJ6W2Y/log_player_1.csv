Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it holds significant value and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John acts as a safety net willing to pay your minimum price, your goal is to get Bob as close to that as possible.
* **Strong Starting Point:** Starting at $10,000 leaves no money on the table. While it's above Bob's perceived value, it sets the stage for potential negotiation.
* **Conveying Value:** The message implies the product's worth and the benefit of Bob securing it before others. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will outright reject this offer. However, it's the strongest opening move to maximize potential profit. If Bob rejects, you haven't lost anything and can sell to John as planned."
