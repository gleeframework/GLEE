,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $900000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you the product for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $950000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $1000000?  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
