"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,500 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale. By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to secure a better price closer to her $12,000 value."
