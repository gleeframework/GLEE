# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,125,000 is still not enough for me to meet my minimum requirements.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price of $1,150,000, and it seems unlikely that she will budge any further.  You've made significant progress in negotiating, but you're still above your ideal budget. With only a few rounds remaining, it's not worth risking the deal falling through completely.  

Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees you get the product at your desired price, and it avoids any further risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffers."
