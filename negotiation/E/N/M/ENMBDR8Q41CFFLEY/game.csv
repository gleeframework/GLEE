"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is a fair offer for a product of this caliber.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. Let's make this happen - $14,250 and we have a deal.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $14,250 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",14000.0,Bob,6,
