"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is close to my minimum, I think there's still room to get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $14,500. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still above my minimum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous one, but I'm going to accept it. It's been a couple of rounds, and it's getting closer to my minimum. I don't want to risk further negotiations and potentially end up with a lower price or even having to sell to John for $10,000."
