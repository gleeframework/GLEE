I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below what I'd sell it to John for. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm lowering my price a bit from the previous offer, but still keeping it above what Bob offered. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer is still too low for me, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a compromise.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
