"Alice, I appreciate your offer. The product is certainly interesting, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If that's still not acceptable, I'm happy to discuss further, but I won't go lower than that.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
