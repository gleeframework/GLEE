,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $75? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $82.50.  Let's meet in the middle at $80.  I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm ready to buy the product now.",80.0,Bob,4,
