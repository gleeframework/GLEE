"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is better than $100 from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $85, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $95.  This is a fair starting point for a counteroffer, as it is above Alice's valuation of $80, but still below Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $90 is a good deal for Bob. It's better than John's offer of $100 and only $5 more than Bob's counteroffer. There's a good chance Alice will not budge further, so it's best for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
