Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd find it highly beneficial. I'm offering it to you at a premium price of $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to maximize her profit. While she has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, selling to Bob at a higher price would be more profitable.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Alice needs to offer a price lower than Bob's valuation, but high enough to maximize her gain.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer. 

**Why this strategy?**

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, leading Alice to John's offer. However, there's also a good chance Bob might accept a price slightly above his perceived value, especially if he sees the product as unique or valuable to his specific needs."
