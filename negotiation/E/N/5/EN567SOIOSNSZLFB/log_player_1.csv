"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment.  I'm initially offering it to you for $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential price ceiling. 
* **Confident Language:**  The message uses confident language to emphasize the product's value without being aggressive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price, signaling flexibility.

This opening offer is designed to:

* **Anchor:**  Set a high reference point that may influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Gather Information:**  Observe Bob's reaction to this initial offer to better understand his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and your initial asking price.  There's room for negotiation. Selling to John right now would meet your minimum price, but there's potential to get a better deal from Bob with some strategic counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  The counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate by reducing the price by $150,000. However, it's still significantly above Bob's offer and closer to your desired range. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message continues to emphasize the product's inherent value, reinforcing its worth in Bob's mind. 
* **Firm but Flexible Tone:**  The language remains firm about the product's value while suggesting a willingness to find a compromise.

This round aims to:

* **Test Bob's Resolve:**  See how Bob responds to a price reduction that's still significantly in your favor.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  Avoid appearing overly eager or desperate to make a deal, preserving negotiating power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant amount and a fair reflection of the product's value. This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches your minimum acceptable price and the price John is offering. While there might be a slight chance of negotiating a slightly higher price with Bob, it's a relatively small risk compared to the potential of him walking away. Accepting this offer secures a good deal without jeopardizing the sale."
