"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. It has a lot of potential, and I believe it could be quite valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.  This is a fair price, given its potential, and it's significantly less than what I could potentially get from another buyer. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
