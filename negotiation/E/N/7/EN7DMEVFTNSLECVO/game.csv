"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $95.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my initial offer. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",90.0,Alice,5,

"I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $87.50. Can we meet in the middle?",87.5,Bob,6,
