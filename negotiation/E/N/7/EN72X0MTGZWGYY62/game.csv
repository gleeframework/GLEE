"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1200000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm prepared to come down to $1350000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. Can you consider my revised offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
