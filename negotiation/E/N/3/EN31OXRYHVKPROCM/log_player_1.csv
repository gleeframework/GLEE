Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price, as it is higher than what the product is worth to him, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy allows for potential negotiation while also securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is still a fair price, considering the product is worth $100 to him, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although I prefer to sell for $110, Bob's offer of $108 is only $2 less than my counteroffer.  He seems unwilling to go higher, and it's getting closer to the price he's willing to pay.  I'm going to accept his offer to avoid potentially losing him as a buyer and ending up with nothing."
