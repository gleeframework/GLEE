"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is still within your budget, it's not the best deal. You can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $105. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $115, but still above my maximum budget of $100.  This gives me room to negotiate without immediately rejecting a potentially acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price to $110, it's still higher than my ideal price of $100. I can continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get closer to my target price.  There's a good chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially if she wants to make a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $108.  This is a small increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get a better price than Alice's current offer of $110. It's also within a reasonable range for both of us, potentially making it a good deal for both parties."
