"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $90
* **Your Value:** $100
* **John's Price:** $100

It's better to reject Alice's offer. Even though it's a discount, you can get the same product from John for the same price ($100). This means you're not saving any money by accepting Alice's offer."
