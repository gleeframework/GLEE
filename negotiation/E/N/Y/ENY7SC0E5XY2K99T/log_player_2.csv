Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and present yours.  While I understand your perspective, $1,400,000 falls significantly short of what I believe the product is worth. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered.
