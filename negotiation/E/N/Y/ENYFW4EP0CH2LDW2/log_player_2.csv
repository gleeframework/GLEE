"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my budget. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice I'm serious about negotiating. $12,000 is still a decent amount, but it's significantly lower than her initial offer. This should prompt her to consider a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 simply wouldn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $15000? This would allow me to still make a profit and hopefully remain within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my preferred budget. I want to see if I can get it even lower. I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $13,000? That's a good compromise and closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm moving a bit closer to Alice's offer, but still keeping it below her last proposal. This shows a genuine effort to negotiate while staying within my budget constraints.  I'm hopeful that this offer will be more appealing to her."
