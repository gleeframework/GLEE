Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay that much or if he'll counter with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum value than my initial offer of $100.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to accept it."
