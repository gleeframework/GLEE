Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and you have a guaranteed buyer at that price, you have room to start high.  
* **Strategic Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, even without going into specifics.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price leaves space for negotiation if Bob counters. You can then gradually lower the price, aiming for somewhere above your minimum.

**Important:** It's crucial to gauge Bob's interest and adjust your negotiation strategy accordingly. This response provides a strong opening move, but flexibility is key in negotiation."
