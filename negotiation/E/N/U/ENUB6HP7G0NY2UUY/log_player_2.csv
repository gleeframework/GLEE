Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is a bit lower than her initial offer, it's still above his preferred price point and he can likely get a better price from Alice or John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below 1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try 1520000? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer is still significantly higher than his desired price, and it's likely that further negotiations would be long and arduous. John offers a much better deal and a guaranteed price, eliminating the risk of further negotiations."
