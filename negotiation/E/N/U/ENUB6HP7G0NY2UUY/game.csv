"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below 1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try 1520000? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
