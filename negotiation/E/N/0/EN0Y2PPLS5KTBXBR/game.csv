"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I've assessed, I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is substantial. I could consider coming down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can only offer $850,000.  It's a significant step toward a deal, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
