"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll derive from it.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While I value the product, $1,025,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this is a fair price, considering both our perspectives. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
