"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's first offer is already close to that.  Let's see if we can get it down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $110.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
