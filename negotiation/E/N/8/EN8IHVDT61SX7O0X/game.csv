"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $108 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $106.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets the deal done.",106.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $106. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $109. It's a fair price, considering the product's value, and I think it's worth considering.",109.0,Alice,5,
