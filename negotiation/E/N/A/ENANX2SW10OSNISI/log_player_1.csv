Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, starting high anchors the negotiation in your favor. 
* **Close to Bob's value:**  $950,000 is a significant chunk above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties (even though John will buy at your desired price) adds a time pressure element, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
