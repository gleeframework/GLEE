"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price given its exceptional value and unique features.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Would you be open to discussing a lower price, perhaps closer to the $1500000 mark?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1750000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also acknowledges your budget concerns.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. The offer of $1750000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still think we can find a solution that works for both of us. Considering my budget, could we possibly meet at $1600000? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while acknowledging the value of the product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $1650000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued effort to accommodate my budget, Alice. While $1650000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1500000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground at $1600000? This would allow me to consider purchasing the product without exceeding my financial limits.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
