Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $125. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $125 allows for some negotiation room while still being a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $80.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording ""willing to part with it"" suggests some flexibility in the price, encouraging Bob to engage even if he finds the initial price a bit high."
