"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I know it would be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you, and I'll still be able to get a good price for it. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,
