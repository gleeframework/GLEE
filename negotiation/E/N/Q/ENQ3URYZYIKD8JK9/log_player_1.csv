{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a fair price considering the value to Bob.  We'll see if he bites or makes a counter-offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is above my minimum threshold of $10,000, and it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
