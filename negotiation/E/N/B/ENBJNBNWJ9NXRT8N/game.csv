"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. $60 is quite low, but I want to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $70? I'm trying to be reasonable.",70.0,Bob,4,
