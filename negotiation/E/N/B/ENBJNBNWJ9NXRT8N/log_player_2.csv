"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would really benefit you. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation.  Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Anchoring:** By starting very low, we're trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to our desired price range.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  We don't want to start too high and limit our ability to negotiate upward if needed. 
* **Signaling Seriousness:** Offering a concrete price shows we're serious about buying, but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. $60 is quite low, but I want to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $130 is still significantly higher than both our target price and John's offer. We need to hold firm and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $70? I'm trying to be reasonable."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Slow Increase:** We're increasing our offer slightly to show movement and willingness to negotiate, but not by much. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (being reasonable) makes our position more understandable.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will give us a better sense of how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a fair price. $95 is my final offer, and I think it's a pretty good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Still Above Budget:**  While $95 is closer to our budget, it's still above what John is offering. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice using the phrase ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic. We still have rounds to go, and there's a chance she'll be willing to negotiate further.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  We can still try to meet somewhere between $70 and $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, $95 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $80, but that's really the most I can do."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting the Limit:**  We're now offering our absolute maximum price, matching John's offer. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  The language suggests we're being reasonable and have reached our limit.
* **Putting the Ball in Alice's Court:**  This forces Alice to decide if she wants to make a deal or risk losing the sale entirely."
