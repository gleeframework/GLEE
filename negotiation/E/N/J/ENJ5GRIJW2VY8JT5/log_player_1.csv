Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, the true value of this product is considerably higher.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new counteroffer of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting $1,100,000 would be a substantial loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed deal."
