,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still allows me to get a fair return on my investment while acknowledging the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle on this one.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This price is a fair compromise, and it's within my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's compromise at $1,050,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable product while ensuring I receive a fair price. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
