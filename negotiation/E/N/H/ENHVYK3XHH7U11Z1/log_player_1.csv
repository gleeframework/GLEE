Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This price is a fair compromise, and it's within my budget. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
