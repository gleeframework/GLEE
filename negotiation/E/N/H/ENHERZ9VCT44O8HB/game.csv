"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I could consider a price of $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the value it brings.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
