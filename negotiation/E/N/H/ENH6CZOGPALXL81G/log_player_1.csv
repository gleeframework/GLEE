"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the value of the product to Bob in my message to incentivize him to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling openness to negotiation by using ""Let me know what you think"". 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a price as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible. By starting high and being flexible, I aim to encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  If the negotiation doesn't progress, I can always sell to John for my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested in the product and willing to compromise.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to bridge the gap between his offer and my desired price, keeping in mind the need to secure a price that's closer to my minimum value. I'll also need to be mindful of the limited rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $11,000 significantly narrows the gap between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob and emphasize finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Signaling Flexibility:**  By lowering my price, I demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

With limited rounds remaining, I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my minimum value.  If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I'll secure a decent profit.  If he rejects, I'll continue negotiating, keeping the possibility of selling to John for $15,000 as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $10,500 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  While we're getting closer, there's still room for negotiation.  With limited rounds, I need to aim for a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'll try to push for a price closer to $11,000 or higher. If I can't get a satisfactory price, I can always sell to John for my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  This is a good price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Adjustment:** My counteroffer of $10,800 is a small adjustment from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still remaining closer to my desired price.
* **Focus on Value & Compromise:** I reiterate the value of the product and emphasize the compromise I'm making to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Openness to Agreement:** I end with a question, encouraging Bob to consider accepting the offer.

**Strategy:**

With only a few rounds left, I'm trying to reach a compromise that is closer to my minimum value.  This small adjustment may be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer. If he rejects, I'll have to be more aggressive in the following rounds or risk selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $10,300 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $10,300 is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds left, I need to be strategic and aim for a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, I'm not yet ready to accept a price that's so far below my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $11,000 or higher, hoping to reach a compromise in the remaining rounds.  If I can't secure a satisfactory price, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and efforts to find a solution. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,300 is still not a feasible price for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,600, which reflects a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can close this deal with a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm increasing my offer by $300 to $10,600. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate but also keeps the price closer to my minimum value.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I reiterate that my offer is a significant compromise to emphasize the value I'm placing on reaching an agreement.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  By asking ""Let's see if we can close this deal..."", I encourage Bob to consider accepting the offer.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds remaining, I'm aiming for a compromise that is as close to my minimum value as possible.  I hope this small increment, combined with the emphasis on compromise, will be enough to convince Bob to accept. If he rejects, I'll have to be prepared to either make a final counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your patience, Alice. I understand your position, and I am willing to consider $10,400 as a fair price for the product.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $10,400 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only two rounds left, I need to be strategic and aim for a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not yet ready to accept. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $11,000 or higher. If I can't secure a satisfactory price, I'll sell to John."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a compromise.  I understand we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I'm still willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $10,700 for the product.  This is a good price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  It's my final offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my final offer, signaling that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Compromise:**  $10,700 represents a significant compromise on my part, showcasing my willingness to reach a deal. 
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency, pushing Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

With only one round left, I'm making a final effort to close the deal at a price that's closer to my minimum value.  If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John for $15,000.  This approach balances the risk of not getting the best price with the need to avoid losing out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your final offer. Considering the value of the product to me, I am willing to agree on a price of $10,550. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,550
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum Value:**  While Bob's final offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  This is the final round. I cannot make any further counteroffers.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I get my minimum value and avoid a potentially worse outcome. While $10,550 is a decent price, it doesn't meet my minimum requirements.  It's important to stay true to my minimum value to secure a profitable deal."
