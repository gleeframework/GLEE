,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  This is a good price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and efforts to find a solution. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,300 is still not a feasible price for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,600, which reflects a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can close this deal with a price that works for both of us.",10600.0,Alice,7,
