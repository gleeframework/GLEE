"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer. If I accept her offer, I would be paying $1,400,000, which is more than I'm willing to pay. I can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, so I will reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
