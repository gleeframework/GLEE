"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it, seeing as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Given your value for the product, I believe $11,500 is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's try to find common ground.",11500.0,Bob,4,
