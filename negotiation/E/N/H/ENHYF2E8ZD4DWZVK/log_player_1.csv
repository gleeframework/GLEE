This is a starting point. I'm offering the product for $1,500,000, which is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers. 

However, I'm prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low. John's offer of $1,200,000 provides a safety net, allowing me to avoid selling the product for less than its minimum value to me."
