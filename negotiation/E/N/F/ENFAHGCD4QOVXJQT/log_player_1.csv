Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that is slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 120}

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my initial offer, so I'll consider his counteroffer. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'm not willing to sell it for less than that. However, I'm also not willing to walk away from a guaranteed sale, so I'll make a decision.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer. Here's a counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 110}

I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle and pay a bit more for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $100 and my initial offer was $120, I'll make a counteroffer that's somewhere in between. Here's my revised offer:

{""product_price"": 115}

I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me at this price point, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my counteroffer again, and he's sticking to his original offer of $100. Since I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100, I'll consider my options.

I'll choose option (3) and sell the product to John for $100. I'll take the guaranteed sale and the price I was willing to accept in the first place.
