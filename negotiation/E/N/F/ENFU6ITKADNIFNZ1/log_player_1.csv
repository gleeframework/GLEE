"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price, but I'm also aware of my backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still leaves room for profit for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I appreciate Bob's willingness to increase his offer, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not desperate to sell the product, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but if Bob doesn't come closer to my minimum, I might just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  Let's split the difference again.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000.  This is my absolute bottom line. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll be forced to move on."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's becoming clear that we won't be able to agree on a price. I'm not willing to go lower, and I'm confident that John will buy the product from me at my desired price.  Therefore, I'm going to sell to John."
