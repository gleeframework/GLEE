Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to start by offering Bob the full $10,000.  This is the price I'd get from John, so it's my baseline. It's possible Bob will accept, and if not, we can negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise, acknowledging that Bob is willing to pay more than his initial offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will be close enough to his limit that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing this sale and potentially having to deal with more negotiation with Bob or selling to John for the same price. It's better to secure the sale now."
