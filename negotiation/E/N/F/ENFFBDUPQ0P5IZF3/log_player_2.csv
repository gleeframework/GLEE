Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not ready to accept $78 just yet. I can offer it to you for $81. It's my final counteroffer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81

Alice seems firm in her pricing and it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting at $81 secures a decent discount from both her initial offer and John's price."
