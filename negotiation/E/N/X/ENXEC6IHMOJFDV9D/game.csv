,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",16500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500 as a final offer. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Alice,5,
