"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9500. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500 for this product. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice you are serious about buying but are also looking for a significant discount. This initial counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still being within your budget and demonstrating you are willing to compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target price. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and push for a price closer to your desired $8,500.  There's still room for compromise, and rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750, which is a fair price given the value we've both agreed upon. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway between her offer and your previous one.  The message reinforces the shared value you both see in the product, aiming to encourage Alice to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm not willing to go below $9200. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still a bit above your target price, but it's within your budget and closer to your desired price than John's offer of $10,000.  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, so further negotiation may not be fruitful.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product and avoid potentially getting stuck with John's higher price."
