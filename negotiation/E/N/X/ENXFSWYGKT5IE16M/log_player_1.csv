Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000, so we need to start significantly above that.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **John as Leverage:** We don't explicitly mention John, but the fact that we have a backup offer gives us a stronger position.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between:

1.  Securing a sale above Bob's perceived value.
2.  Leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than our guaranteed offer."
