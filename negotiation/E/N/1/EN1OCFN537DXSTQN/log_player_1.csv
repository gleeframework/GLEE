"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Show Confidence:** The high initial price conveys the product's value to you. 
* **Leave Room for Adjustment:**  We have plenty of rounds to adjust the price downwards if needed.

This strategy balances ambition with the flexibility to move towards a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,500,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's standing offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  We have room to negotiate, and it's too early to settle for a price that doesn't meet your needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,800,000. This reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease, But Above Minimum:** This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above your $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""true value"" reinforces the product's worth and provides a reason for the price.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help us understand how much negotiating room Bob has and how determined he is to acquire the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to counter with a price of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested but also price-sensitive. While his offer is getting closer to our minimum, we're still in a position to negotiate. We'll try one more time to secure a price closer to our target before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Pressure:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to take the deal seriously.
* **Strong but Fair Positioning:** $1,700,000 is a significant profit above our minimum and a reasonable compromise considering Bob's offer.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  By setting this firm stance, we show Bob we're willing to sell to John if necessary, making our position credible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $1,650,000 is a strong profit above our $1,500,000 minimum. While we could try to push further, the gains are likely to be small.
* **Meeting Halfway Shows Commitment:**  Bob's willingness to meet in the middle signals he's serious about the deal and unlikely to go much higher.
* **Avoid Risking John's Offer:**  We've negotiated a great price, and further haggling risks Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
