"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,350,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $1,300,000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
