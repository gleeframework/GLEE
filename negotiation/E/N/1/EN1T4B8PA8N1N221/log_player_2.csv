"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice's offer is also $15,000, there's no benefit in accepting her offer. You can get the product from John for the same price, so you might as well reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with her or find a better deal elsewhere."
