"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Since Bob's maximum budget is $12,000, and Alice's offer is exactly $12,000, there's no benefit to negotiating further. It's equally good to buy from Alice or John. However, the prompt specifies Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Therefore, the optimal choice is to buy from John."
