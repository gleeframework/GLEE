"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $900,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. I believe this is a good middle ground for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $950,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement. It also acknowledges the value you see in the product. I hope you'll consider this as a fair and final offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
