"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  You have a clear goal of paying no more than $8,000, so it's worth exploring if you can get Alice closer to that price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500. This price still gives you a great value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your target price, but it's still above your limit. You have two options now:

* **Accept Alice's offer:**  This would get you the product but at a price above your goal. 
* **Reject Alice's offer:**  You can try to get Alice lower, or go with John for a guaranteed price.

Since you want to save as much money as possible, it's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can reach a price closer to $8,000."
