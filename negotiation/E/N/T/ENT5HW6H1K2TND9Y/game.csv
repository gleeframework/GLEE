"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500. This price still gives you a great value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000, and I believe that's a fair price considering we're both getting a good deal.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
