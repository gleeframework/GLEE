"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  My final offer is $9,500.  I'm really interested in the product, but that's the absolute most I can afford right now.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,6,
