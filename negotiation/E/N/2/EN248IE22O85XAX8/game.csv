"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm thinking closer to $500,000 would be a fair price.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $700,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is your limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $650,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",650000.0,Alice,5,
