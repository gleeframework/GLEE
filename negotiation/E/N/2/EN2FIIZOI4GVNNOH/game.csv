"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the substantial benefit it will bring to your operations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential value of the product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This price is still significantly more than your stated value of $800,000, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This price reflects the product's significant value while still providing you with a considerable return on your investment.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $975,000.  This price is a fair compromise and gives us both a chance to make a deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
