Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust my strategy accordingly."
