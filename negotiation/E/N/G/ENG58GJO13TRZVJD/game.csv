"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  I know it's worth a lot more to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Can you consider this revised offer?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $92.50 is still just a little too low for me.  Let's try $94. This is a fair price that's closer to both of our desired values.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $94 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $92. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a final offer. Can you consider this?",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your budget limit, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Let's meet in the middle at $93. I'm confident we can find common ground.",93.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Alice, but $93 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one final offer of $91. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the purchase. If not, I'll consider buying from John for $80.",91.0,Bob,8,
