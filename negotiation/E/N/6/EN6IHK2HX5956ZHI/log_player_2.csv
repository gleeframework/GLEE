"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $950,000. This exceptional offer is tailored to meet your expectations and ensure you receive the best value for your needs. We believe this price reflects the product's true worth and its immense benefits to you. Please let us know if you require more information or wish to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $950,000 is better than John's price of $1,000,000, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $850,000. This would still give you a healthy profit and allow me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative that might better align with both our interests. For the time being, I am unable to reduce the price further than $900,000. This still represents a significant profit for us while offering you a competitive deal compared to market standards. Please let me know if this revised offer is acceptable or if you require additional details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's revised offer of $900,000 is still better than John's price of $1,000,000. While you could try to counter again, it's risky. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but she might not budge further. Accepting her offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
