"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is more than your maximum budget. It's always better to try to negotiate a better price before resorting to the alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it gives us room to negotiate.  Alice may reject this, but it's a good starting point to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly your maximum budget, and  buying from John will cost you the same. You can stop negotiating and buy from Alice now."
