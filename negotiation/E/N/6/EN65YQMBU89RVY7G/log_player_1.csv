"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. While $1,250,000 is a good offer, we're still early in the negotiation, and I believe I can push for a bit more.  We'll aim slightly above his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to the product's real worth. How about $1,275,000?"",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now countering below my last reduction, indicating potential stiffness.  While $1,225,000 is tempting, I believe holding firm now might push him closer to my desired range.  I'll signal I'm nearing my limit in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, $1,250,000 is about as low as I can go. This is a very special product, and I'm confident you won't find this value elsewhere. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm holding firm at my previous price while emphasizing it's my limit. This signals seriousness and might encourage Bob to finalize the deal rather than risk losing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly holding firm at $1,200,000. While it's below my target, continuing to push risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting now guarantees a significant profit, and it's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with John's lower offer later."
