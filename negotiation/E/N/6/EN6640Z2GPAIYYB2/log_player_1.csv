{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum.  This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.  I'll be prepared to counter-offer if needed, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counter-offers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still far below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find some common ground.  What about $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise.  This counteroffer shows flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed.  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup in case things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give in right away.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  If things don't work out, I'm always prepared to sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous one, which would be $10,125.  If you're truly interested in the product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10125}
```

I'm still trying to get as close to my desired price as possible, but I'm showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.  This counteroffer is a small step towards Bob's offer, which could encourage him to meet me halfway. I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup plan in case negotiations fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $10,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,900 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offers, it's still below my minimum.  I've already made several concessions and I'm not sure if further negotiation will get me closer to my desired price.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $15,000, it's simply not worth continuing negotiations with Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John and secure the better deal."
