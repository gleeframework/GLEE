"Alice, thanks for the offer. $10000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $8500,  I think that's a fair price considering your initial offer. Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that.",8500.0,Bob,4,
