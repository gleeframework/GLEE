"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. $10000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $8,000. I'm also confident that I can get a better offer from Bob within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $8500,  I think that's a fair price considering your initial offer. Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's a good price, and it's above my minimum of $8,000.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
