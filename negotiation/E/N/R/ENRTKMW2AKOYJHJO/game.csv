"Hello Bob, I'm excited to tell you about the product I'm selling. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business.  To kick off our conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and having a productive discussion.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your starting price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle somewhere. Can you consider my offer?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer.  It shows you're serious about the product. To be fair, there's a significant gap between your offer and my initial asking price. Let's aim for that middle ground you mentioned. How about we consider $1,450,000? It reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but I think we can do better than $1,450,000. Can you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise here.  However, that offer is still a significant gap from what I had in mind.  To be transparent, I have another interested buyer.  If you're unable to offer at least $1,400,000, I may need to pursue that other opportunity.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you have other interested buyers, but I'm still interested in this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,380,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",1380000.0,Bob,6,
