"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be highly beneficial to your business. My asking price is $1,700,000, which represents a significant discount from its true worth to me. While I am confident in its potential value to you, I understand that this price may be outside your budget.  If you're interested, we can discuss payment terms and explore ways to make this transaction work.  If not, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my full asking price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.
