{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice's offer is $900,000.  This is more than you are willing to pay.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start strong and signal that I'm serious about getting a good deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still $50,000 more than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to keep negotiating and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay the maximum value I've set for the product, but I won't go higher. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll purchase from John.  I'm confident this will lead to a deal."
