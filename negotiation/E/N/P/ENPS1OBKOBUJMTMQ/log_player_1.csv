Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 is slightly outside my budget.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $1,350,000. This price aligns with my current financial capabilities and allows for a fair margin for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that $1,375,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal.
