"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is a bit lower than Alice's initial value, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your guaranteed lower price."
