"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. I understand it might be a bit more than you initially envisioned, but I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is higher than your maximum.
* Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $800,000."
