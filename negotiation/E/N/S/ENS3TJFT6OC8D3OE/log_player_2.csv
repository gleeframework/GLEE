You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get the price down further, saving more money."

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price point. There's still room to negotiate further, and Bob could potentially get the price lower by sending another counteroffer."
