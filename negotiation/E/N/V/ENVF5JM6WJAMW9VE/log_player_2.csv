"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. Would you be interested in paying $100 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one. It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
