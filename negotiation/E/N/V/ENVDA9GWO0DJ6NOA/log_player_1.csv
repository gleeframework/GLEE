Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting negotiations significantly lower might raise suspicion or undervalue the product. A high starting point leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""other interested parties,""  we create a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Targeting above Bob's valuation:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but the goal is to maximize profit. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than his initial valuation, especially if he perceives high value and potential competition.
* **Backup plan:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, so we don't risk selling below our minimum.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having a safety net in John's offer."
