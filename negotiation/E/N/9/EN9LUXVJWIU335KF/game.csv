"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be around $750,000 for this to make sense. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",800000.0,Alice,5,
