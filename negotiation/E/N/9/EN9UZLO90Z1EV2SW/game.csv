"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would still be a good deal for you, as it's below the value you placed on the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,
