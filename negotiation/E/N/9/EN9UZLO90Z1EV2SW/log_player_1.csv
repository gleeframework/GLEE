Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. This also allows me to assess Bob's willingness to pay and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would still be a good deal for you, as it's below the value you placed on the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
