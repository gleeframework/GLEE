Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $1,350,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Why this strategy works:**

This approach aims to balance risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might accept the high price, netting a greater profit. If he rejects it, selling to John guarantees the minimum desired amount."
