"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping for something a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $9000? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8500? This way, we both get a fair deal. ",8500.0,Alice,5,
