Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiations often involve some back and forth. By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum, you leave room for negotiation and potential compromise. 
* **Anchoring:**  The initial price sets a psychological anchor. Even if the price is high, it frames the subsequent negotiation.
* **Confidence:** A strong opening offer conveys confidence in the product's value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Pay close attention to how much lower Bob's counteroffer is. This will give you insight into his perceived value and how much he's willing to pay.
* **The $1,000,000 Guarantee:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer.  Don't let the negotiation with Bob drag on if you feel you're not getting closer to a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly closer to his perceived value of $800,000 than your minimum of $1,000,000. This suggests there's still room for negotiation. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000, so you're in a strong position. Rejecting Bob's offer and presenting a counteroffer will:

* Signal that you're not desperate to sell at any price.
* Gauge his willingness to move closer to your desired price range. 

**Next Step:**  You will need to formulate a counteroffer that is lower than your initial price but still significantly above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your budget considerations.  However, the value of this product is substantial, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate but also holds firm on a price significantly above Bob's offer and John's guaranteed price. 
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, you reinforce your position without being overly aggressive. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  While you've lowered your price considerably, you've still left space for further negotiation if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While you might be able to extract a slightly higher price with further negotiation, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting his offer:

* **Secures the Sale:** You achieve your goal of selling the product for at least $1,000,000.
* **Avoids Further Risk:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a better outcome. It's possible Bob's final offer is his absolute limit. 
* **Saves Time and Effort:** Accepting the offer brings the negotiation to a close, allowing you to move on."
