"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $150 as a fair price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""

Bob is offering the maximum value he places on the product, and I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150. It makes the most sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
