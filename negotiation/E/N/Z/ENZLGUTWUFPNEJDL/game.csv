"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in this product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. ",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
