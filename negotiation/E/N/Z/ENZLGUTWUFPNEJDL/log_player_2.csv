"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can get a better deal than $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in this product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

While you could try to negotiate further, Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 more than what you could get from John.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, especially since Alice may be less willing to budge after rejecting your previous offer."
