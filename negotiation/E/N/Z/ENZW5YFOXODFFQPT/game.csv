"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable piece and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $600,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I need to see some movement from your side to make this work.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $850,000.  This is a firm price, and I'm only willing to negotiate one more time. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll be forced to consider selling to John.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I understand this is your final negotiation, so I'll be direct. I can do $780,000. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.",780000.0,Bob,6,
