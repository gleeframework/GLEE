# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $14,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we're close but still have a way to go. I understand this is your final offer, but to be honest,  $12,800 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  To make this work, I can do $12,000. This ensures you get a fair price above your value, and I get the product at a price that works for me."",
