Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations at a strong point. Offering the product at your true value leaves room for negotiation while establishing a firm baseline.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's seriousness and willingness to negotiate. If he outright rejects this high price, it might be best to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $600,000 is substantially lower than both your valuation ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000).  
* **Room for Negotiation:** This discrepancy suggests there's a lot of room for negotiation. Rejecting his initial offer allows you to counter and potentially reach a price closer to your desired outcome.
* **John as Leverage:** You always have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price. This gives you a strong position to walk away if Bob's offers remain too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease:** This counteroffer shows flexibility by dropping $100,000 from your initial ask. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate.
* **Above Bob's Valuation:** By staying above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, you're still aiming for a price that benefits you significantly.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's seriousness. If he's unwilling to move closer to your price range, it might be time to consider John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's willingness to meet in the middle demonstrates good faith in the negotiation process. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's also the risk that Bob might walk away.  Accepting this offer secures a very favorable outcome."
