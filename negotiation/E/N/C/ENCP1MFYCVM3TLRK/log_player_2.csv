"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$800,000 is a significant discount from your maximum price of $1,500,000.  There's room to negotiate and potentially get an even better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This signals my strong desire to negotiate and get a good price. I'm hoping to gauge her willingness to compromise and see if we can find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good price, it's still above my ideal range. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'm hopeful Alice will be more willing to compromise with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $600,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, but it's still lower than Alice's last offer.  I'm trying to meet her halfway and see if we can reach an agreement in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $700,000, which is a good price. While I might be able to push for a slightly lower offer,  the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection is high. There are also only 5 rounds left.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
