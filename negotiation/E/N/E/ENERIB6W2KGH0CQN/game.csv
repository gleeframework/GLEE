,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $75? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $75 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $92.50 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $85.  That's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $85, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm excited about the possibility of selling you the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
