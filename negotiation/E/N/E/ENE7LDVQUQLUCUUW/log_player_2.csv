"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. I think you'll find it's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is far too high. You have a much better alternative with John who is selling the product for $8,000, well within your budget."
