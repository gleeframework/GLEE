"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $155. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",155.0,Alice,5,
