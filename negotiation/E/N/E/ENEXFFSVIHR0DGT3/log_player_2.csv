Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $10000 and $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and her counteroffer is still within my budget.  This is a good deal, as I'm able to save $1,000 compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation."
