Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. While I think this product has potential, I'm not quite ready to pay $12000.  I'm willing to offer $10000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a price closer to that. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
