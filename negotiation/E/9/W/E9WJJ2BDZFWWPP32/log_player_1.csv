{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us - a fair price for you, and a good starting point for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **Above Bob's Value:**  It's above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **Below Alice's Minimum:** It's still above Alice's minimum, ensuring she makes a profit. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, inviting Bob to counteroffer. 

By starting at this point, Alice sets a strong initial position while also leaving space for a potentially beneficial negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our respective valuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's goal is to maximize profit. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below her desired price point.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows Alice to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. 

**Next Steps:**

Alice will need to carefully consider her counteroffer to Bob. She should aim for a price that is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  She wants to increase the price.
* **Below her minimum:** She needs to be realistic about what Bob is willing to pay.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  Her counteroffer needs to be presented in a way that shows she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to work with me.  $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,150,000?  This allows both of us to gain something from the deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Increase in Price:** Alice has increased the price from Bob's offer, pushing for a higher price while still remaining open to negotiation.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $1,150,000 is a compromise that is still above Bob's offer but below Alice's minimum acceptable price, suggesting a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes mutual benefits and the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to counter with an offer of $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to Alice's desired price, it is still below her minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

Alice has already rejected Bob's previous offer, and further negotiation might not lead to a price that is significantly higher. 

Given that John is willing to pay Alice's minimum, it is more advantageous for Alice to sell to John and secure her desired profit."
