"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While $110 is less than Alice's valuation of $120, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $100. You can do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within your budget. This aims to establish a starting point for negotiation, allowing you to potentially reach a compromise price before you have to resort to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is within your budget and is a significant improvement from her initial offer. While you can continue negotiating and try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise or that the negotiation might drag on.  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a decent price within your budget."
