Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $120 is a good starting point. It's well above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive messaging:**  A friendly message can help create a more positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Opportunity to accept:**  The offer leaves the door open for Bob to accept without making a counteroffer. 

This strategy allows me to potentially maximize my profit while also keeping the negotiation open and flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $100 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is to maximize profit:**  While $100 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price point. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's message indicates he's open to negotiation, suggesting a counteroffer is worth pursuing. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Positive framing:**  Highlighing the ""fair price"" and ""great deal"" emphasizes the win-win nature of the potential agreement. 
* **Remaining firm:**  While I'm willing to budge, I'm not giving in completely, keeping the negotiation going towards a more profitable outcome."
