"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is well above my budget. Given the value of $800,000 to me, I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This price reflects its inherent value while still offering you a significant return."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still above my maximum budget.  Considering the value I've determined for the product, I can offer $775,000.  This price is a reasonable compromise that reflects both our respective valuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to John's price, I still have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal.  I'm willing to nudge down a bit more before accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower my price to $875,000. I believe this offer fairly considers its value and allows you room for a great return."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're inching closer. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is now exceeding John's standing offer of $800,000. It's a strong signal that continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result, and there's always the risk Bob could lower his offer. Accepting now secures a profitable deal."
