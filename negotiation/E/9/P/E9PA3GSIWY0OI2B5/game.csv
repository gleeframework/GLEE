"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000.  I believe it's a fair offer considering its potential return on investment.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is well above my budget. Given the value of $800,000 to me, I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This price reflects its inherent value while still offering you a significant return.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still above my maximum budget.  Considering the value I've determined for the product, I can offer $775,000.  This price is a reasonable compromise that reflects both our respective valuations.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower my price to $875,000. I believe this offer fairly considers its value and allows you room for a great return.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're inching closer. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I've placed on the product.",825000.0,Bob,6,
