"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8,250?  It's still a good deal considering the value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if that works for you.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be more reasonable for me.",7800.0,Bob,4,
