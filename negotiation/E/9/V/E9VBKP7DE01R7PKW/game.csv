"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I know it has the potential to be even more valuable for your business.  I'm offering it to you for $1,750,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and provides a fair margin for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
