"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective on the price.  However, my initial offer reflects the true value and potential of this product. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe a fair offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. This product would be useful, but I need to be mindful of my spending. How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I understand your position, but $700,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table. I'm willing to consider $950,000. This offer takes into account your budget constraints while still reflecting the product's worth.",950000.0,Alice,5,
