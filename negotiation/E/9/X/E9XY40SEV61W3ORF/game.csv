"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000 for the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,200,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fairer deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $900,000? I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,4,
