"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value your interest, $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still allows me to cover my costs and offers you a considerable return on investment.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $850,000 for the product? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still obtaining a valuable asset.",850000.0,Bob,4,
