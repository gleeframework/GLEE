"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can we meet in the middle at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $9500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $10000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a fair profit. How about we meet in the middle at $11250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $11250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10500, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at that price?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you've reached your limit, Bob, but I'm still not getting the price I want. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we meet at $10800?",10800.0,Alice,7,
