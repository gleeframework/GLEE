"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the value I know it can bring to your business.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
