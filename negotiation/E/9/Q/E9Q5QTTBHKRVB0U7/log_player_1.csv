Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to both of us. While I want to reach an agreement, accepting such a low price would be a substantial loss. I'm confident we can find a more agreeable middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This offer represents a significant saving for you while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is now offering a price that is above my minimum acceptable value.  While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting his offer ensures a successful sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
