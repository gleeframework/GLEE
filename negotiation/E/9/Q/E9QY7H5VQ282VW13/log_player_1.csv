Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $125 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
