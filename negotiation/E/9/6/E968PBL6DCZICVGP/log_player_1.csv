"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $70 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I'd like to get more than $80 for the product, Bob is clearly not willing to pay more than $75. I've already rejected his last offer and I'm not confident I can get him to go higher.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially wasting more time, I'll sell to John for $80."
