"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's interest while leaving myself some room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,000.  This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still significantly higher than his offer.  Hopefully, we can close the deal at a price that is fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is not budging from his offer of $9,000. While tempting, that's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm running out of time. I'll make one more counteroffer before seriously considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm making one last attempt to reach a compromise with Bob. I'm lowering my price to $9,500, which is closer to his offer.  If he still rejects, I'll be forced to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging from his offer, and I'm running out of time. I've already lowered my price to $9,500, which is close to his maximum value.  While it's disappointing not to close the deal with Bob, selling to John at $12,000 is the best option to ensure my minimum value is met."
