Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round. $100 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $100 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This price reflects the value of the product and is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $120 is a fair price for you, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Can you consider meeting me at $110? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to get as close to the value as possible without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again. While $110 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better price, especially since I have a backup buyer in John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $115.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product, which is just a little above the middle ground. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $112 is closer to my desired price, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to close the deal in the next round.  I'm confident I can get a better price than $112."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to go down to $114, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 114}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to go down to $114, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $111 for the product, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still too low. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I don't want to risk losing any more time. It's time to sell to John and get the guaranteed $120."
