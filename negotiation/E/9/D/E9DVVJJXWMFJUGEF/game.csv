"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Can you meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $100 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This price reflects the value of the product and is fair for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a fair price for you, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Can you consider meeting me at $110? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to get as close to the value as possible without breaking the bank.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $115. This price allows for a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product, which is just a little above the middle ground. Can you consider this offer?",112.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to go down to $114, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",114.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go down to $114, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $111 for the product, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",111.0,Bob,8,
