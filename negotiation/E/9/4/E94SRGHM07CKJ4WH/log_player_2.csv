"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. I think it's a great deal and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $120 is a decent price and below your maximum, there's a chance you can get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, getting you closer to the $100 value she places on it."
