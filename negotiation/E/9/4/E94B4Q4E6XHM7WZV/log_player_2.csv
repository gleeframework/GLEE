```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows us to both benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
