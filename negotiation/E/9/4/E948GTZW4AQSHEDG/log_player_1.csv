Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 3

We're still significantly above John's offer, and there's room to negotiate further.  Bob's incremental increases suggest he's willing to go higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 890000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** By stating ""This is my final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and seriousness. 
* **Slight Concession:** The  $10,000 decrease from the previous counteroffer shows flexibility but emphasizes the value.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We're still above Bob's offer but leaving some room for him to potentially counter with a number we'll accept (e.g., $880,000 or $885,000).  
* **Deadline Awareness:**  We're halfway through the rounds, so adding some pressure is strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a solution that works for both of us, but I'm still at $875,000. I'm willing to make a deal at this price. Is that acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $875,000 is significantly higher than John's offer ($800,000) and a good profit margin.
* **Stalemate Risk:** Bob is holding firm at $875,000. Further negotiation could be lengthy and risky, with the possibility of him not budging further.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now rather than later has value, as money earned sooner is more valuable than money earned later."
