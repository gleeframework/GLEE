"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can likely get a better price than $1,400,000.  While $1,500,000 is the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay, it's in his best interest to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's $200,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation, and allows Alice to feel like she's still getting a good price while also benefiting Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,300,000, which is within Bob's acceptable range and a significant savings compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal for both parties, and there's no need to risk further negotiation."
