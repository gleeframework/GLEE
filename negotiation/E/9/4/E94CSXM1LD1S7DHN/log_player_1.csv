Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000** is a strong starting offer, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* This offer is attractive to Bob as it's below his perceived value of the product ($1,500,000).
* This offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, giving you a chance to gauge his level of interest and potentially negotiate a higher price.
* It's also above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring you're not selling yourself short."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still above your minimum acceptable price, it's significantly lower than your initial offer and your desired profit margin. 

* **Rejecting the offer** allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.  
* You can make a counteroffer closer to your initial offer, aiming for a middle ground.
* Selling to John for $1,000,000 would guarantee a sale but result in a lower profit than you could potentially achieve through continued negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial $1,400,000 but still above Bob's $1,200,000 offer.
* It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also committed to getting a fair price. 
* By meeting halfway, I increase the chances of Bob accepting and reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
