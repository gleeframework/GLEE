Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he negotiates, you know he's interested but wants a better price. If he flat out refuses, you can always fall back on John's offer. 
* **Alternative Guarantee:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below that price, allowing you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob."
