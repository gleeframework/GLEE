Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, allowing me to adjust the price if necessary. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $120 provides a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to accept $85?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $120.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a price closer to my target.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a potential buyer provides security if negotiations with Bob completely break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize that $95 is still a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone encourages further negotiation. 
* **Moving Closer to Target:** This counteroffer brings me closer to my desired price point while keeping negotiations open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget.  Would you consider $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $90 is getting closer to my desired price point of $120. 
* **No Significant Room for Improvement:**  Given that John is willing to pay $120, I'm unlikely to get a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a substantial increase in price, while it does consume time and energy. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of negotiations breaking down completely."
