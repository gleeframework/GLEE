Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate downwards if necessary and might lead to a better outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $120, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate. Bob is likely to counteroffer, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Alternative Option:** It's important to remember I have John as a backup buyer. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'll counter in the next round to try and move the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $60 is significantly below the value of this product. I could consider $100. This is still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** After Bob's lowball offer, I'm compromising by coming down from $120 to $100. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price well above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating that the product is valuable to nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not drastically lowering my price.  Bob needs to show he's willing to move closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has value, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $75 is a reasonable outcome. It's significantly above my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob or potentially losing him as a buyer altogether."
