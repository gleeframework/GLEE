"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is way too high.  You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so you should definitely try to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone helps keep the negotiation positive, even while being firm about your price limits.
* **Target Price in Mind:** Remember, your goal is to get the product for as close to $80 as possible. By starting low, you increase your chances of reaching a price point that saves you money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $60 is significantly below the value of this product. I could consider $100. This is still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but $100 is still a long way from what you're willing to pay, and quite a bit more expensive than John's offer. There's room for negotiation, and it makes sense to see if Alice will move closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the product has value, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price of $75, you're demonstrating a willingness to compromise and move closer to Alice's asking price. 
* **Middle Ground:** This offer represents a reasonable middle ground between your initial offer ($60) and Alice's current offer ($100).
* **Still Below Budget:**  Importantly, $75 keeps you below your $80 maximum and allows for a potential deal that's better than John's offer."
