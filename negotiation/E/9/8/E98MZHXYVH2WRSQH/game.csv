"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly more than I'd receive elsewhere. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $900,000?  That's still a significant profit for you, and it's a good deal for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a very good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
