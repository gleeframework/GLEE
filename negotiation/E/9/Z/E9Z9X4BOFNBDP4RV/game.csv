"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? This would give you a good price while still allowing me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $11,000. Can you consider this offer?",11000.0,Bob,4,
