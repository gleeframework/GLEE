"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This offer is closer to my budget and I believe it's a fair price considering we're both trying to find a solution. Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
