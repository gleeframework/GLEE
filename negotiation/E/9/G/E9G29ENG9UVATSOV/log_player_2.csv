{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product. 
* Alice's offer of $95 is better than John's offer of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $95.
* You are willing to pay up to $120.
* A counteroffer of $85 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* This price is closer to Alice's value of $80, but still leaves room for some profit for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer is $90, which is still better than John's offer of $120. 
* While you might be able to negotiate further, the potential savings are small.
* It's more efficient to accept the offer and avoid additional rounds of negotiation."
