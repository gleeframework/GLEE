"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a lower price and me to earn a substantial profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Alice's offer of $12,500 is a good deal. You save $2,500 compared to buying from John and it's still within your budget."
