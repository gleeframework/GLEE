Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,500,000 might scare Bob off.  A good strategy is to aim for a price that gives you a significant portion of the profit margin while still leaving Bob with a feeling that he's getting a good deal.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and Bob's gain.
* **Price:** $1,350,000 gives you a profit of $350,000, which is a significant chunk of the potential $500,000 margin. This leaves Bob with a potential perceived ""discount"" of $150,000, making the offer more appealing. 

**Important Note:** Negotiation is fluid. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly, but always keep your minimum ($1,000,000) in mind."
