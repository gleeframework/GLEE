"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is above Bob's value for the product, but it gives me a good starting point for negotiation.  I know I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000, so I'm willing to risk a rejection in the first round to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is closer to my ideal price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,100,000.  This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but I think it shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up a little bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still feel like I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,050,000. This is closer to Bob's last offer, but still above his value for the product.  I'm trying to strike a balance between showing my willingness to negotiate and maintaining a good price. We're in the middle of the negotiation, and I'm hoping this offer will get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $880,000 is getting close to my minimum, I still feel like I can get a better price. We are in the middle of the negotiation, and I'm hoping this offer will get us closer to a deal. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $980,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping that Bob will reciprocate and meet me halfway.  We're getting close to the end of our negotiations, and I need to make a decision soon about whether to sell to Bob or John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is too low. While I am willing to negotiate, I can't go that low and still meet my minimum price requirement.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and with John's offer of $1,000,000, I am better off selling to him.  While it is not my ideal price, it's still a better deal than what Bob is offering."
