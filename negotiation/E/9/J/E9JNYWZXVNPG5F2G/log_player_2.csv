Alice's offer is still too high. You should reject it and continue to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $14,000. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?

Alice is still asking for more than you're willing to pay.  Since you can get the product from John for $12,000, that's the best option."
