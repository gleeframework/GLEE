Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This offer is slightly below your minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and potential profit if Bob accepts. It also shows you're willing to be flexible.  If Bob rejects, you can always counter with a higher price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $150.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  This way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal.  I'm better off selling to John for $150 and ensuring a higher profit.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is that he might walk away entirely, leaving me with no sale."
