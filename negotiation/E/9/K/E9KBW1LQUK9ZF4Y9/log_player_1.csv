Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $10,000 is a bit too low, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $18,000?  This reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $18,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  I feel that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I see you're serious about this product. Let's bridge the gap - how about $16,000?  This is my final offer, as it's cutting close to my bottom line."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we possibly settle on $13,000?  I'm hoping we can make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's time to cut bait with Bob. He's unlikely to go above $13,000 and we have a guaranteed offer for $15,000 from John.  It's better to take the sure thing and move on."
