"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. I think a fair price would be $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $9,500
* **Your value for the product:** $10,000
* **John's price:** $10,000

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay $10,000 to John.  While this is the maximum you're willing to spend, it's still better than paying $9,500 to Alice."
