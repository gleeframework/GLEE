"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can do better. You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 and the product is worth $1,000,000 to her, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?

Alice is moving closer to your ideal price, but there's still room for improvement.  You can continue negotiating to try to get the price down further.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm still not ready to accept $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you can keep negotiating, Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  At $875,000, you are still saving $325,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise, and it's worth accepting to avoid the risk of Alice walking away or further negotiation taking too long."
