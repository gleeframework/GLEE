Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $9,500 is a considerable profit over the $8,000 backup offer from John."
