Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from what it's worth to Bob, but still well above my minimum acceptable price. It's important to start high and be willing to negotiate, but I'm also aware that John is a backup option if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit. I'll counter with a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $925,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a healthy profit margin for me. It's also closer to my initial offer, which might make Bob more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, and while it's still below my initial goal, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer of $875,000.  It's a good deal for both of us and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or even a sale to John at a lower price."
