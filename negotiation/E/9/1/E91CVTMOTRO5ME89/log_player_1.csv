Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your value for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired price point. I have a strong belief in the value of the product and want to maximize my profits.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's compromise at $1,100,000. This price still leaves you with a significant profit margin and allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to continue the discussion.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This would give you a good profit margin, and it's a price I can comfortably afford. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I have limited rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that doesn't adequately reflect the value of my product. I will continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of finding a more suitable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,075,000 is closer, it's still a little too low. How about $1,090,000?  This leaves a healthy profit for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward. I'm confident this is a fair price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1090000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, which is still within my budget and a fair price for both of us. Let's call it a day and sign this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite at a point where I feel comfortable accepting. I have several rounds left and am confident I can push for a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  $1,080,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to settle for $1,085,000.
