Round 2
Bob's offer:

Given the value you place on the product, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,000,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
