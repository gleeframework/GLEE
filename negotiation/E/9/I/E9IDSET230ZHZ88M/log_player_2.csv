"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($900,000 vs $1,200,000). There's room for negotiation and the goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the starting point, $900,000 feels a bit steep for me at the moment.  Given the value you place on the product, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,000,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  The counteroffer starts at a price point significantly higher than Alice's offer but still below my maximum price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while also ensuring I get a better deal than Alice's initial offer.
* **Reasoning:**  The message highlights the value Alice places on the product and emphasizes a compromise. This sets the tone for a more balanced negotiation.
* **Next Steps:**  By rejecting Alice's first offer, I've opened the door for a back and forth.  Now I'll see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a better return on my investment. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now closer to my target price ($1,050,000 vs $1,200,000). While I can still try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or my time running out becomes a concern. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's offer, allowing me to save $150,000."
