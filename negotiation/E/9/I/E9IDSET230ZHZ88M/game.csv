"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the starting point, $900,000 feels a bit steep for me at the moment.  Given the value you place on the product, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,000,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a better return on my investment. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
