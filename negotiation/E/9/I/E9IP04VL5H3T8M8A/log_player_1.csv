Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to the middle ground between our valuations. This will give us room to negotiate if Bob rejects. If he does, I'll be prepared to counter and eventually reach a deal that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I will counter with a higher offer, hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm increasing the offer to $950,000. It's closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. Hopefully this will persuade Bob to accept the offer without needing further rounds of counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point and it's not worth risking further negotiations.  I'll accept his offer and secure a good deal."
