"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit.  While I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob, I want to see if I can secure a price close to the maximum.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a significant profit. I believe that $10,500 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's initial counteroffer and my own desire to maximize earnings.  I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  While I'd like to get a higher price, I risk losing too much time and potentially ending up with John's offer, which is significantly lower. Accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit and avoids further risk."
