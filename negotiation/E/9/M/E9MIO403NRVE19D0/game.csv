"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,225,000. I believe this price is more in line with the market value of the product.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
