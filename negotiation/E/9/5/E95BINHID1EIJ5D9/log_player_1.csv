This is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It also shows a willingness to deal, which could encourage Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100?  This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me see if I can come up with something closer to what you're asking. How about $95 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
