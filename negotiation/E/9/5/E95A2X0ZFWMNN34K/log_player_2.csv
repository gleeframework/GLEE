"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $95. I believe it would be of great value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is less than what John offers, it's still above Alice's value and leaves little room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price."
