"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."",

}
``` 

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much room there is for negotiation. It's still significantly below my maximum budget, giving me space to increase my offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $125 is still too high. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my limit, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and meet at $100? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

-  I'm going straight to my maximum budget of $100.  This is a firm but fair offer. 
- By saying it's my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling that I'm serious and unlikely to go higher.  
- Alice is motivated to sell, and $100 is still a profit for her. 
- If she rejects this, I'll go with John, as there's no point in further negotiation."
