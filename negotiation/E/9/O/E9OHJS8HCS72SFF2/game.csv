"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something that can be incredibly valuable to you, and I believe it's worth $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still leaves significant value for you, and it's a fair price for the product's potential.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,150,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you meet me at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
