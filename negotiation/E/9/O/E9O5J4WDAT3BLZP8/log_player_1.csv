"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, recognizing that Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  I'm aiming to capture some of the difference, but leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product's worth.  I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I believe the product is worth."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,075,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to my last offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to accept.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise before I decide to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. How about $1,090,000? That's a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle, Alice. Based on the value of the product to me, I would like to counter with a price of $1,085,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still want to try to negotiate a bit higher. We're getting close to the end, and I want to see if I can secure a price that's more beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping to reach a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,095,000. This offer is very close to your last proposal, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1095000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. Given the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a final offer of $1,090,000. I believe this is a fair compromise based on our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, and Bob's offer still below my minimum acceptable price, it's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed sale to John.  While I'd prefer to have negotiated a higher price with Bob, it's better to secure the $1,200,000 than risk ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
