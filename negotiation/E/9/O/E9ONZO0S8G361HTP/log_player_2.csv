Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $118. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $118, and it's not worth the risk of her going higher in future rounds. Buying from John for $120 guarantees the best price at this point."
