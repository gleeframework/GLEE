"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000, reflecting its value and potential. I'm open to discussion, so let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable number.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford such a high price. Would you consider lowering it to $1,100,000? This would allow us to reach a fair agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,100,000 is a respectable offer, it falls short of the product's true worth.  I'm willing to compromise, but a price of $1,250,000 reflects the value and potential we've discussed. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $1,250,000 is too high for me. I propose a price of $1,225,000. This allows us to get closer to a fair deal while also respecting the value of the product.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
