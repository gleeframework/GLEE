Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,100,000 is a respectable offer, it falls short of the product's true worth.  I'm willing to compromise, but a price of $1,250,000 reflects the value and potential we've discussed. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.
