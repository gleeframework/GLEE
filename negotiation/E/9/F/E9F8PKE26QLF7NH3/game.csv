,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your price point, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $9,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product valuable.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  However,  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but that's my absolute limit. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,875.  This price is a significant compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,875 is closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better deal. I'm prepared to go up to $8,800.  If we can reach an agreement at this price, I'm ready to close the deal.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,800 is still a bit short of what I need.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $8,850.  This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen!",8850.0,Alice,7,
