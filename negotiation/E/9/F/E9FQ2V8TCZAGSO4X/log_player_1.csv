Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price significantly lower than my minimum but still higher than Bob's estimated value. This could encourage Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm offering $12,000 to Bob.  This is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum, and it shows I'm willing to compromise.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to budge much. Selling to John guarantees me my desired minimum price, so I'll choose that option."
