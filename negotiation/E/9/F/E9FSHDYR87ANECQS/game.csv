"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a revised offer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to a fair price, I can't accept anything less than $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
