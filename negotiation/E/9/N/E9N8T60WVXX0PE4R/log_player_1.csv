Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above what I believe Bob is willing to pay, giving room for negotiation. I'm confident I can still get a good price for the product, but if Bob rejects the offer, I'm prepared to counter and eventually sell to John for $150 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob, but if necessary, I'll sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $130 is a decent compromise and still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting Bob's offer is the best option in this scenario."
