Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair deal considering its value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to find a price point that works better for me.  Would you consider $1,125,000?  It's a significant increase from my last offer and puts us closer to a fair agreement.
