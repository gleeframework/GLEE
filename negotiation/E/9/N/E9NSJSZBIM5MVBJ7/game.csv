"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair deal considering its value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to find a price point that works better for me.  Would you consider $1,125,000?  It's a significant increase from my last offer and puts us closer to a fair agreement.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll lower my price to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to close this deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
