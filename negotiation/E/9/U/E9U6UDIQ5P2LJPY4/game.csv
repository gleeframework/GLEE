"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! However, I've invested a lot of time and effort into this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to sell it for at least $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to sell it for at least $105. I'm willing to throw in a small discount for you, but that's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the discount you're offering, Alice, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $100.50. Can you consider that?",100.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $100.50, but I'd like to throw in an additional incentive to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that complements the product perfectly. With that, I'm willing to sell it to you for $102.50. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional incentive, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $100.50, but I'd like to ask if you can throw in a slightly better accessory or consider a lower price. Can you meet me at $99?",99.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $99, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to throw in the same accessory I mentioned earlier, and I'll also include a 5% discount on the total price. That brings the price down to $94.75. I think that's a fair deal, considering the value I'm offering. What do you think?",94.75,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the 5% discount, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $90, and I'll even take the accessory and the discount. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,10,
