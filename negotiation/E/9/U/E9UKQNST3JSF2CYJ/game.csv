"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, the product's inherent worth and potential necessitate a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this still allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $1,600,000 remains outside my price range. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise for me and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
