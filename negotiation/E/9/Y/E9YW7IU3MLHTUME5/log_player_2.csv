Alice's offer is way too high.  It's much better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering Alice the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. This is a significant reduction from her initial offer and hopefully will get us closer to a deal."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's closer to my desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

I'm raising my offer slightly to $1,500,000. This is a compromise and hopefully shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but I still can't go much higher."
