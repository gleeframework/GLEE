Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,075,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become unwilling to sell or raise her price even higher. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking losing the deal entirely."
