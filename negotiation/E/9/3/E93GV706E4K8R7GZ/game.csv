"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $650,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I believe the product is valuable, $850,000 is still a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me. I'm getting close to my limit, but I could manage $775,000. This offer represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",775000.0,Bob,6,
