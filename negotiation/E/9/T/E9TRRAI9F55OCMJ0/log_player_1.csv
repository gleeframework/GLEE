Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to aim slightly lower to entice Bob while still maximizing your profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $149 creates a sense of urgency (""limited time"") and makes the price seem like a bargain compared to your guaranteed sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting high leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing a price higher than $150.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how badly he might want the product."
