"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about $1,250,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,225,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
