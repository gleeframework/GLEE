"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially when you have a backup option.  By rejecting the offer, you can try to bring the price down closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This shows a strong intent to negotiate and hopefully prompts Alice to come down in price.  It's a bold move, but I'm hoping it will push the negotiations in the right direction. I'll adjust my strategy based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can bring the price down even more. There's always a chance that Alice might be willing to meet me halfway. If not, I still have the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing that I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a good deal. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, suggesting a compromise and potentially leading to a successful negotiation.  I'm hoping that this shows Alice I'm flexible but still firmly within my budget."
