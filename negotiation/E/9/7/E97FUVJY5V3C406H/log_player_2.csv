"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $13,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's closer to his target of $10,000. It's a good deal considering that Bob could still buy the product from John for $10,000.  It's worth accepting to save time and effort."
