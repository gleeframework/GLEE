"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $11,200?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",10900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,900 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,050?  This is a very fair price, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good deal. ",11050.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm happy to compromise one last time. Let's settle on $10,999. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10999.0,Alice,7,
