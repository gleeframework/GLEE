I've decided to sell the product to John for $800,000. While Bob and I have come closer in our negotiations, it appears he is unwilling to go above $875,000.  This is still below my desired minimum price, and I'm concerned we'll run out of time to reach an agreement.  Selling to John guarantees a solid profit, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure thing by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
