"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This price still gives you a significant return on your investment, and it's a fair compromise. Let's reach an agreement and move forward.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I'm still hoping we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm not sure we're getting closer. $875,000 is still below my minimum. Let's try $890,000. This gives you a good deal, and gets us closer to a deal. Let's find common ground.",890000.0,Alice,5,
