"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. While $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate.",900000.0,Alice,5,
