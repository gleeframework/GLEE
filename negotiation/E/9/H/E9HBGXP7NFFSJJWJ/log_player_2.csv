"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. I'm willing to let you have it for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than your $100 budget and the guaranteed $100 price from John.  It makes the most sense to go directly to John."
