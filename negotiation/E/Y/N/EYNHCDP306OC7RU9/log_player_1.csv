Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about $950,000? This would allow me to secure a reasonable profit while still being within my budget.

While $1,010,000 is below my ideal price, it's still a good profit and better than selling to John for $1,500,000.  There's a chance that if I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, so accepting his offer is the best strategy here."
