"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $8,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to sell the product for a price that's fair to me.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,800?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go a bit lower, but $7,800 is still too low for me.  How about we settle at $8,200? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's get this done!",8200.0,Alice,5,
