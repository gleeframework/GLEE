Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, $1,250,000 is a significant gap from what I consider its true worth. I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we meet at $1,350,000? This reflects its value and our shared interest in a successful deal.
