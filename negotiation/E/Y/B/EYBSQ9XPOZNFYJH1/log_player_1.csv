"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below my minimum ($1,200,000) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing my bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By calling it a ""starting point"" and asking for Bob's thoughts, I demonstrate willingness to negotiate and gauge his initial reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer is moving in the right direction, $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to guide him closer to my range. I'll reject this offer and prepare a counteroffer that keeps the negotiation active while aiming higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our positions is still quite significant. This product offers exceptional value, and I need to see a price that reflects that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This is a very competitive offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Bridge:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and acknowledging the gap, showing I'm engaged in the negotiation.
* **Hold Firm (For Now):** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($50,000) to signal that my price isn't arbitrary and I'm not going to drastically drop my asking price. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm re-emphasizing the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Compromise:** I'm framing this counteroffer as a compromise, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a more aggressive offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still committed to staying within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is now acceptable. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** While it's below my initial asking price, it's still a significant profit above my minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Strong Position:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating his strong interest in the product.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out negotiations further might not yield much more movement, and I risk Bob losing interest. It's better to secure a good deal now. 

While selling to John guarantees my minimum, accepting Bob's offer secures a significant profit without further risk or delay."
