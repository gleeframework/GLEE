"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I can still earn a significant amount. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us â€“ it's a good deal for me, and you still get a profit. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $950,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $925,000? It's a fair price that gives you a good deal and me a respectable profit.  Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
