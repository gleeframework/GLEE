"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I can still earn a significant amount. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice, potentially reaching a price closer to his desired range."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $950,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob might be able to convince Alice to drop the price further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $925,000? It's a fair price that gives you a good deal and me a respectable profit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible, and $925,000 is still above his budget. At this point, it's in his best interest to buy the product from John.  While he won't get the best possible deal, he'll be able to purchase the product within his budget and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
