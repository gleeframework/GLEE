"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  To move this forward, I could consider $875,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the value you'll gain.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $875,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
