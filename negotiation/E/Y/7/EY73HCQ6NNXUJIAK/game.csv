"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great deal for a product worth so much to you!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a little too high for me.  How about $108?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
