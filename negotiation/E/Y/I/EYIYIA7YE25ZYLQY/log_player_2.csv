"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than her value ($800,000) but lower than your maximum price ($1,000,000). 
* There is room for negotiation, and you can potentially save more money. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially reach a better price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than her value ($800,000), but closer to your maximum price ($1,000,000).
* It's important to try to push for a lower price, especially since there is still room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting the offer, you can make another counteroffer and try to get closer to your desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is the same as her original offer in round 1.
* You've already made a counteroffer and been rejected, so there's no guarantee that a further counteroffer will be successful.
*  It's better to accept the offer at $950,000 than to risk going to John and paying $1,000,000. 

While you might be able to get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. You can save $50,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant amount."
