Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a reasonable price. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $8,500. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation with Alice for a potential savings of $500, especially since there's no guarantee she'll go that low."
