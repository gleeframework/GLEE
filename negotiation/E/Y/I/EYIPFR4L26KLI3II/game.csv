"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product. Would that be feasible for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a reasonable price. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Could you consider $7,000?  That would be a great compromise for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
