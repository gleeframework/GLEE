Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  It also gives Bob a good deal since the product is worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $85 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in a lower price, so accepting his offer is the best strategy in this situation."
