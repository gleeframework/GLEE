Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal for something of this value."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, and your minimum is $8,000.  Aiming high initially allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $12,000 is a strong opening but leaves Bob with a perceived ""win"" if he accepts. This makes the offer psychologically appealing.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John ($8,000). This knowledge allows you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always lower the price slightly, but never go below your $8,000 minimum."
