Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already come down a lot from my initial price. I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint, so I can offer you $100 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's unlikely Alice will go down to $80. She's rejected your offer at that price, and continuing the negotiation might not yield a better result.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price."
