"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $20000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Can you meet me at that price?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking more along the lines of $22000. Can you consider that?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $19000 for the product. Can you consider that?",19000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $19000. I'm willing to meet you at $21000. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Can you consider that?",21000.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $20500. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",20500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $18000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you seriously consider meeting me at $18000?",18000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting a bit frustrated, but I'm not willing to go as low as $18000. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $20000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. This is my last offer, so please take it seriously.",20000.0,Alice,9,
