"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $100 for it right now.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $175. Would you be interested in considering that price?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $150? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can be a satisfied customer.",150.0,Bob,4,
