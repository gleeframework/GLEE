Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

Round 3

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial arrangement. Considering the value of the product and your budget constraints, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $890,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within your financial limits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.  It's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly lower price.  Accepting this offer saves Bob a considerable amount compared to buying from John."
