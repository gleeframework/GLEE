"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal as it's worth more to you than that. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget ($12,000), you know you have another option with John.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with her, closer to her perceived value of $8,000. 
* Even if Alice doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John at $12,000."
