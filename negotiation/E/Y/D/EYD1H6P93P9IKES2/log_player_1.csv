{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $150 but still leaves some room for negotiation and potentially earns me more than selling to John. It's also within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay, considering he values the product at $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the most I'm willing to pay for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $120? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering $120, which is still lower than my minimum price but allows for further negotiation. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough to Bob while still leaving some room for a higher price in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $110 is getting closer to my target price, it's still below my minimum desired price of $150.  I'm not convinced that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a better outcome, and I'm confident I can get my minimum price from John.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John."
