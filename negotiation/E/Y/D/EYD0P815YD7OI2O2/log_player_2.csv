Given its high value and exclusivity, I propose a special introductory price of $12000 for you, aiming to provide you with an opportunity to experience its benefits at a competitive rate.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, and Alice is offering the same price, there is no benefit in accepting Alice's offer. Bob should reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John."
