"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1200000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1200000.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a significant amount, but I still believe the product's value to me is $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $950000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $900000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $875000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the value you place on it.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $885000. This is as close to my minimum price as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $875000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. I'm not interested in paying $885000, as it's still a bit too high for me. I'd like to stick with my previous counteroffer of $875000.",875000.0,Bob,6,
