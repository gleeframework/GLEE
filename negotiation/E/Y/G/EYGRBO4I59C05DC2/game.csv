"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $750,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $850,000.  This would be a fair price that allows me to purchase the product while ensuring you still receive a reasonable amount.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the product's full value. Would you consider $890,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $890,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's within my budget. Would you consider $870,000?  That's a significant step closer to my range, and I think we can both be happy with that outcome.",870000.0,Bob,6,
