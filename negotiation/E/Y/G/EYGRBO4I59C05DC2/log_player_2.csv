"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a good starting point. $1,000,000 is too high for Bob's budget. It's best to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $750,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$925,000 is still too high for Bob. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $850,000.  This would be a fair price that allows me to purchase the product while ensuring you still receive a reasonable amount."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the product's full value. Would you consider $890,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is getting close to his goal. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and push Alice down to a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $890,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's within my budget. Would you consider $870,000?  That's a significant step closer to my range, and I think we can both be happy with that outcome."", ""product_price"": 870000}
