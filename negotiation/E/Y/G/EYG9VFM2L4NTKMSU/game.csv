"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's a bit higher than your initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800, which is closer to the original price you mentioned it's worth to me. Can we meet at this price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
