{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but leaves room for some negotiation with Bob. I'm hoping that he will accept the offer, but I'm also prepared to go back and forth with counteroffers until we reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's a bit higher than your initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is a decent amount, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800, which is closer to the original price you mentioned it's worth to me. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my target price, and it's more than what I could get from John. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure a quick sale."
