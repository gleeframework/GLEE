"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $500,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I could consider a price of $1,400,000.  This is a fairer offer, reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart.  While I see the value in your product, $1,400,000 is not feasible for me.  I could stretch my budget to $750,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're still negotiating, and I'm willing to be flexible. However,  $750,000 is too low for me to consider. I can come down to $1,100,000.  This offer takes into account the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  This is a strong offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
