"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference at $87.50? I'm sure we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
