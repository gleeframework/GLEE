"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $90 right now.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $105? It's still a great price for the value you'll get from this product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to move on to another seller.",95.0,Bob,4,
