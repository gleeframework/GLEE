Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm initially proposing a price of $10,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give me valuable information. If he accepts immediately, I know I could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it outright, I can adjust downwards. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
