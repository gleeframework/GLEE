Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired sale price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Bob seems firm on his offer and is unlikely to move significantly closer to my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
