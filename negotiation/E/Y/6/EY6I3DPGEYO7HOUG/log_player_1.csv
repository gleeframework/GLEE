{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This offer is time-sensitive as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to his valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** Your fallback option of John at $800,000 provides a safety net.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Creating a sense of urgency and making Bob feel like he has a special opportunity can encourage him to accept.

By offering the product at $925,000, you leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin above your minimum acceptable price."
