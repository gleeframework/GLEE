Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $110.  This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's valuation but still gives him room to negotiate.  If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to counter and hopefully find a price we can both agree on.  However, I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $120, so I won't settle for anything significantly lower than $110."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum valuation of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for such a low price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $110, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $90. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product at a higher price.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up a bit on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum valuation, I'm still going to reject it. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe we can still find a price that's more favorable for me.  I'll counter with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, and hopefully, we can finally come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $100. This is a compromise from my previous offer of $105, and it's right in the middle of our last two offers. I believe this shows I'm serious about finding a deal, but I'm still not willing to settle for a price that's too far below my minimum valuation. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer and we can finally close the deal."
