"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $90 is a bit higher than my budget. How about $75? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $78. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider John's offer.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $78 and $85, which would be $81.50. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",81.5,Alice,5,
