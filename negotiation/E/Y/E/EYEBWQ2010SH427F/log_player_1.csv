Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $16,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stated, hinting at the product's value and your intention to offer it elsewhere can make Bob consider the offer more seriously. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $16,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. You can then potentially settle on a price higher than your minimum of $12,000.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects this offer, you can always lower the price, but going significantly lower than $14,000 would be cutting into your potential profit significantly."
