"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. I propose selling the product to you for $130. This allows you to save compared to the original value, while also ensuring a fair return for me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $130 is lower than John's price of $150, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal.  She might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
