"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional qualities and potential.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's unique qualities and potential benefits to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and justify the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a clear invitation to Bob to discuss the offer, showing I'm open to negotiation. 

This strategy aims to create a strong starting point, while leaving room for compromise and potential for a deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  This is my best offer, and I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's still above my minimum value.  However, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I have 8 rounds left, so I'm not under immediate pressure to accept. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Signal My Willingness to Negotiate:**  Rejecting shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a better price.
* **Gain Leverage:**  By making a counteroffer, I can attempt to bridge the gap and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **Explore Options:** If Bob's counteroffer is still too low, I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000.

This strategy balances my desire to earn as much as possible with the need to keep the negotiation open and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,000,000 is a fair starting point, I believe this product's value justifies a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer. This price is still well within the range of what this product is worth. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,300,000 moves halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still pursuing a price closer to my desired range.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I emphasize the product's worth to justify the price, reminding Bob of its potential benefits. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I frame the counteroffer as a ""solution"" that benefits both of us. This creates a more positive and collaborative tone. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, demonstrating flexibility while also maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1300000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1150000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product, but also aligns with my budget. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum value but I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I have 6 rounds left and I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price.

Here's why I'm choosing to reject:

* **Potential for Improvement:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  While $1,150,000 is close to my minimum, I don't want to settle too quickly. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting, I can make another counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **Evaluating John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a tempting option, but it's good to see if I can get a better deal from Bob.

This strategy focuses on maximizing my potential earnings by keeping the negotiation open and exploring all possible outcomes."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is a good offer, and I'm very close to accepting. However, considering the unique value of this product, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground at $1,200,000. This price would be a fair reflection of the product's worth and allow us to close this deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Accepting:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer is close to acceptable, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Value Justification:**  I reiterate the unique value of the product as a reason to bridge the gap to $1,200,000. 
* **Closing Statement:**  I phrase it as ""Let's make this happen,"" emphasizing a collaborative approach and a desire to finalize the deal.

This counteroffer aims to close the gap to my minimum acceptable price while maintaining a positive negotiation dynamic."
