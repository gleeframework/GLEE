"Hello Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This price reflects the product's exceptional qualities and potential.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  This is my best offer, and I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is a fair starting point, I believe this product's value justifies a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer. This price is still well within the range of what this product is worth. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1300000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1150000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product, but also aligns with my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1150000 is a good offer, and I'm very close to accepting. However, considering the unique value of this product, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground at $1200000. This price would be a fair reflection of the product's worth and allow us to close this deal. Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
