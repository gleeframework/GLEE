"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This price reflects the product's exceptional qualities and potential.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,500,000 is above his budget, and he has the option to buy from John for less. It's best to try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  This is my best offer, and I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is a fair starting point, I believe this product's value justifies a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer. This price is still well within the range of what this product is worth. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for less. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if she's willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product, but also aligns with my budget. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1150000 is a good offer, and I'm very close to accepting. However, considering the unique value of this product, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground at $1200000. This price would be a fair reflection of the product's worth and allow us to close this deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At this point, Alice's offer matches what he can buy from John for.  There's no need to risk a further counter-offer and potentially lose the deal."
