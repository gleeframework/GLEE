Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so $1,400,000 is within a reasonable negotiation range.
* **It's below your minimum:** You want at least $1,500,000, so you're leaving room for negotiation and potentially a counteroffer from Bob.
* **It's clear and concise:**  The message is straightforward and doesn't leave room for misinterpretation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1,300,000 for this product.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,250,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll be getting from the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my goal, it's still significantly lower than what I need to reach my desired profit.  I've already given Bob a significant discount, and further negotiation might not be worth my time.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum target, so that's the best option at this point."
