"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my budget of $800,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. I'm eager to work out a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a substantial discount and reflects my desire to find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget.  While she has come down, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial $850,000 offer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still beyond what I can comfortably afford.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
