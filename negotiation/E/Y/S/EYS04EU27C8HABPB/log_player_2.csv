# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with buying from John for $12,000."
