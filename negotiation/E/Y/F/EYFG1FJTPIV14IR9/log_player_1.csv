Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's in great condition and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum ($150) but still within a reasonable range for Bob. This allows room for negotiation if he rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $125?  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer.  While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  How about $135?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 
I'm offering $135, which is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $130?  That's the absolute most I can spend on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $130 is still a bit lower than my minimum desired price, it's very close, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, but I'm not sure he'll go any higher. It's better to accept his offer now and secure a sale than risk getting nothing."
