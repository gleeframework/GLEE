"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for an exclusive price of $950,000. I believe it presents significant value at this level, given its potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to drop her price to meet your needs, especially if she wants to avoid selling to John for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, I'm unfortunately capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? It's a significant amount and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $875,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is still above your maximum budget. While it's closer to your target, it's worth seeing if you can push her further. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter again and potentially reach a deal closer to your desired price."
