"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, I'm unfortunately capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? It's a significant amount and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's potential.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still outside my budget constraints.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $825,000.  This is a substantial sum and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's potential.",825000.0,Bob,4,
