"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** It's $400,000 above Alice's own valuation, and Bob wants to save as much as possible.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation, as Alice is open to discussing the price.
* **Buying from John is not ideal:**  John's price is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, and Alice's offer is already within that range. 

**Next Steps:** Bob will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 falls short of reflecting that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Would you consider $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for Alice to come down further. 
* **Buying from John is still not ideal:** John's price is the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay, and there's a chance of getting a better deal with Alice.

**Next Steps:** Bob will make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bring the price down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Let's split the difference - how about $1,250,000?  I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you finding middle ground. I'm committed to reaching an agreement that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,275,000? This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Bob's ideal price:** $1,275,000 is only $25,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and there are only 5 rounds remaining.
* **Avoiding John's price:**  Accepting this offer saves Bob $225,000 compared to buying from John.

**Conclusion:**  Bob should accept this offer to secure the product at a price that's close to his desired range and avoid the risk of running out of rounds or needing to buy from John at a higher price."
