Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Starting High:**  Since I know the product's worth to Bob ($100) and my minimum acceptable price ($100), starting at $150 gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will tell me a lot about his eagerness and potential to pay more than the minimum.
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  I'm not relying solely on Bob. Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a loss.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $150 might have been a bit high, $80 is too low for me. Could you do $120? That's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I significantly lowered my price from $150 to $120, signaling flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Aiming for Profit:**  $120 ensures I make a profit while being closer to Bob's initial offer, potentially encouraging him to negotiate further. 
* **Maintaining Control:** I'm still leading the negotiation by proposing a specific price rather than simply asking him to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is slowly coming closer to my minimum, $90 is still not acceptable.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $90 is still a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we split the difference and settle at $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

Here's why:

* **Final Push for Profit:** I'm pushing for a final small profit margin. This price point is designed to be tempting for Bob while still earning me a bit more than John's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""I'm trying to be fair,"" I subtly imply this might be my final offer, encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** I'm getting very close to accepting John's offer. If Bob doesn't accept this counteroffer, I'm likely to walk away and take the guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $105. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Explanation:

Bob doesn't seem willing to move much further. His offer of $85 is too far below my minimum, and it seems unlikely he'll meet my price.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $100 from John."
