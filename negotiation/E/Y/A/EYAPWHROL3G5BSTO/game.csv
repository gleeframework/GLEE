"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $150 might have been a bit high, $80 is too low for me. Could you do $120? That's a fair compromise.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle?,90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $90 is still a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we split the difference and settle at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $105. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,6,
