"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great value at a price that's fair to both of us. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $950,000. This would represent a significant saving for me while still offering you a respectable profit margin.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,000,000. This would be a good middle ground for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while giving you a fair price for the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
