"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I know you'll appreciate its value.  My initial price is $11,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and I believe I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  Given the product's unique qualities and value to you, I believe $10,500 is a fair compromise. This still leaves room for you to benefit significantly, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree that it reflects the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm happy to close the deal now. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale, especially since I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John if I choose to sell to him."
