"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you reaching out and I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given your stated value of $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This leaves room for both of us to make a deal and ensures I can comfortably afford it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise, considering the value this product will bring to your business.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
