"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $120. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a great product, and I think it's worth the extra bit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
