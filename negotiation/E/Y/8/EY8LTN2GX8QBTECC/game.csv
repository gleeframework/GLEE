"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,800,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. I'm glad you see the value in the product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a certain price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I have another option available. ",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm glad you're willing to go up to $1,500,000. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,600,000 and $1,500,000, which is $1,550,000. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
