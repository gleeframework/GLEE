```

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's value, but below your minimum acceptable price.  This creates room for negotiation, allowing you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is more than Bob's value, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's worth trying to get closer to that price by making a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  How about $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you and gets us closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a little closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly below what I'm hoping for.  I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob yet, so I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,750 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,750 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's clear that we're not going to agree on a price, and I don't want to keep going back and forth. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $15,000, which is my minimum requirement."
