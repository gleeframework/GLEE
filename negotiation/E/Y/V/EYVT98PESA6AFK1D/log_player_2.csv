"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which I think is a fair reflection of its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high ($15,000) compared to your maximum budget of $12,000.  You want to save as much money as possible, so it's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $15,000, it's still higher than your budget of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you can always buy from John for $12,000 if this deal falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,500 is still slightly out of my price range.  I'm confident that $12,000 would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping you'll consider that offer. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I'd like to throw in an additional incentive to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package worth $1,000 for free. This way, you'll get the product and some extra benefits that will make it even more valuable to you. So, the total value you'll get is $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at your maximum budget of $12,000.  While the additional service package is worth $1,000, it doesn't increase the product's value to you beyond your budget.  Therefore, it's a good deal to accept, as you're getting the product for your target price."
