"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think you'd be a perfect customer. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
Bob's offer is less than my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth my time to negotiate further, as I have a guaranteed offer from John."
