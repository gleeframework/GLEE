Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  While you could offer it for $150 (its worth to John), there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested but finds $140 a bit too high. 
* **Avoid appearing desperate:**  Offering it for $100 (Bob's valuation) might make you seem desperate to sell and limit potential profit. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit from Bob while still having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
