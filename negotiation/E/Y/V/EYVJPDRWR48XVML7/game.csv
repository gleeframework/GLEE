"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is a tempting offer, I'm looking to get closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,750?  This would still represent a good value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",11750.0,Alice,3,
