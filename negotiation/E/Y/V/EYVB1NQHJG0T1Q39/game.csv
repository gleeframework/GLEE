,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $950,000 is tempting, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering your own valuation of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider it?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is the minimum I can accept. This is a fair price, considering what the product is worth to you.  Let's close this deal now before I decide to go with another buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
