"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your perspective, $750000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the product's unique features and potential, I believe a price closer to $900000 would be more appropriate. Would you be willing to reconsider with an offer closer to that figure?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $825000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",825000.0,Bob,4,
