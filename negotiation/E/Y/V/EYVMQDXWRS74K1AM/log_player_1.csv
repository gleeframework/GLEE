Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. To begin our negotiation, I'd like to offer $850,000 for the product. This represents a fair starting point, considering my budget and the value I place on the product. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,050,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. This is a significant step for me, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a deal. I hope we can find common ground at this price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear that his ceiling is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. You have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John, and continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of either:

*  Wasting valuable time and rounds in negotiation.
*  Eventually settling for a price significantly lower than $1,000,000. 

Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to cut your losses with Bob and sell the product to John at your desired price."
