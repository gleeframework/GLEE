"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product looks promising, but $750,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $650,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the need for some wiggle room in our negotiation.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",700000.0,Alice,3,
