"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's value of $12,000, Bob can still get a better price from John. By rejecting the offer and counter-offering, Bob has the potential to get the product for closer to his $8,000 limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9500 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to recoup some of my costs.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal compared to Alice's value of $12,000, Bob can still get a better price from John. By rejecting the offer and counter-offering, Bob has the potential to get the product for closer to his $8,000 limit.  Since John is offering the product for $8,000, Bob has a clear point of comparison, and he shouldn't accept anything higher than that."
