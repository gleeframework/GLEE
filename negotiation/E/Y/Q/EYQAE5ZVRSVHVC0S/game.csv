"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $9000?  It's a good price for you, and still within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9500 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to recoup some of my costs.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $9500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9200.  It's a good price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can make this deal work.",9200.0,Bob,4,
