Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,150,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. This price still allows you to get a great deal on a product worth significantly more, while ensuring I can achieve a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice has come down to her lowest price, and it matches what John is offering. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as it's unlikely Alice will go any lower.  Buying from John avoids any further risk of the deal with Alice falling through."
