"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices, considering the product is worth $8,000 to you.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal.  Let's make this happen!",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try to meet in the middle again? I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but no higher. Can you meet me there?",10000.0,Bob,4,
