"Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Max Price:** You're willing to pay up to $150.
* **Alice's Offer:** She's offering $125.
* **John's Price:** He's selling for $150.

Since Alice's offer is lower than your max price, but higher than John's price, it's better to reject her offer and buy from John later. This way you save $25."
