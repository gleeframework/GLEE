Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $16,000. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price you're happy with.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob that it's worth a significant amount, potentially justifying the higher price in his mind.
* **Alternative Option:**  Subtly implying you have another buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While starting high, the language keeps the door open for negotiation (""...we can discuss further""). 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while maintaining a good chance of securing a sale with Bob."
