# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm initially setting the price at $20,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a fair offer considering its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  $17,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $12,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're willing to meet me somewhere in the middle. While $12,000 is still lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $15,000. This is a firm offer, as it's the lowest I can go and still reflect the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is holding firm at her product's value of $15,000. While it might be possible to negotiate her down a little more, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Since I can get the product for $10,000 from John, it makes more financial sense to buy it from him and save the extra money."
