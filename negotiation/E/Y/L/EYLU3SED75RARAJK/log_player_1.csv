Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to potentially increase my profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price higher than $10,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing a sale above my minimum. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give me insight into his level of interest and flexibility. If he outright rejects it, I can always adjust my approach knowing I have John as a backup."
