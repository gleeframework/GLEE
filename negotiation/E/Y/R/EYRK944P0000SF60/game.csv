"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a fair price for the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've seen in similar products. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation. However, $1,200,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've invested in this negotiation.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,500,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value I've seen in similar products. Can you consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
