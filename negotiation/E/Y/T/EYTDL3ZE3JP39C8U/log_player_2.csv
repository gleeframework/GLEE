"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting her offer. You can get the product from John for the same price, so rejecting Alice's offer makes more sense."
