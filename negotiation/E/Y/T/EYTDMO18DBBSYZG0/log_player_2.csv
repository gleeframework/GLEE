# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is only worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for more. It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let me know what you think!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, he can still get the product for cheaper from John.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as he might be able to get a better deal than John's offer."
