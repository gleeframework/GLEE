Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's within Bob's range:**  You know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so $13,000 is still potentially attractive.
* **It's a friendly tone:** The message is positive and welcoming, which can help build rapport.

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is below your minimum. While you could accept and sell the product for $11,500, it's likely you can do better by counteroffering. You know John is willing to pay $12,000, so you have a solid baseline for your counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12250} 
``` 
 
This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's above Bob's offer:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate but not willing to go too low.
* **It's below your previous offer:**  It demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **It's a friendly tone:**  The message remains positive, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $12,250.  I'm willing to go up to $11,750, which is halfway between my last offer and your current one.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below your minimum of $12,000, and you've already counteroffered once.  While you could keep negotiating, there's a strong chance you won't reach a mutually acceptable price.  Since John is willing to pay your minimum, it's best to accept his offer and secure the sale at your desired price."
