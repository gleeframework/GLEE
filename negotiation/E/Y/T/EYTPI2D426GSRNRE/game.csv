"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm still very interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly unique and in high demand. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its worth. How about we settle on $1,650,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground while still reflecting the product's intrinsic value.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,650,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,550,000, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you think of any additional value you can offer or any concessions you can make to bring the price down?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation is rooted in maximizing value. While the product itself speaks volumes, I'm open to sweetening the deal.  If we agree on $1,600,000, I'll include [mention a valuable but not deal-breaking add-on or service related to the product - e.g.,  consultation, extended warranty, etc.]. This way, you're getting even more for your investment.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the add-on offer, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,600,000. I'm willing to take the add-on, but I'd like to try to get a better deal on the product itself. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, and I'll take the add-on as a bonus. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
