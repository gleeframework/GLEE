"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $300000. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to make sure it's a good value for my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $300000?",300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. While we understand your concerns about the price, we believe the product offers significant value. We are willing to negotiate further, so we are proposing a counteroffer of $400000. We hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's worth to us. Let us know what you think.",400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $400000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $350000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm eager to make a deal. Would you be willing to accept this price?",350000.0,Bob,4,
