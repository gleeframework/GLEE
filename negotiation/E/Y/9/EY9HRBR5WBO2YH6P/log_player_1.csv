Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $300000. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to make sure it's a good value for my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $300000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
