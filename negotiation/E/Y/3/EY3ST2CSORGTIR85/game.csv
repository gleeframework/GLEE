As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $900,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I understand that's a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $825,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
