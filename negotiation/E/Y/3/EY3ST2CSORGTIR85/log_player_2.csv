After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $175,000 less than John's price.
* **Alice's Final Offer:** Her language suggests she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could push Alice away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
