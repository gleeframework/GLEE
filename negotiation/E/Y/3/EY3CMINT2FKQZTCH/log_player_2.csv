```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $12,500? This price still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
