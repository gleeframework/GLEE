Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,500, which is a bit above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Leaving Room:**  The price is lower than what Bob values the product at, giving him incentive to accept.  
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive response. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or sell to John."
