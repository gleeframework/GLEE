"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects my budget and interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both my desired price and Bob's perceived value. Rejecting this offer allows me to negotiate further and aim for a more favorable outcome. I'm confident I can bridge the gap without having to resort to selling to John at my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential for your specific needs. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,150,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've made a substantial counter-offer, dropping $150,000 from my initial price. This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement while still aiming for a price significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum.  It encourages Bob to recognize the value I'm offering and hopefully meet me closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can offer $975,000.  I believe this demonstrates my serious interest while staying within a reasonable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching closer to a reasonable price point, but we still have room to negotiate. Accepting $975,000 would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table.  I'm willing to counter-offer again and see if we can find a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding the right price. Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the inherent value of the product for your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've reduced my price by another $100,000, demonstrating significant movement towards Bob's offer. This strategic move aims to:

* **Maintain Momentum:**  Keeps the negotiation moving forward, showing Bob my commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Test Bob's Resolve:** This price point will reveal how serious Bob is about purchasing the product and if he's willing to meet me closer to the middle ground.
* **Preserve Profit Margin:** While a significant drop, $1,050,000 still represents a substantial profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this negotiation shows we're both motivated to find a deal. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  I believe this is a very competitive offer and a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 represents a strong compromise and a significant profit for me. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away if I reject this offer. Accepting now secures a substantial gain while avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiation."
