Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm interested in exploring a lower price point. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value to me, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it matches the amount John is willing to pay. Since the product is worth no less than $1,500,000 to me, it makes the most sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
