"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
