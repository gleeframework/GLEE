,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. Would you be interested in taking it from there?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go for $10500? It would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close on the purchase.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10500, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I think $11500 is my bottom line. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the product",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package that's worth $500. That brings the total to $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm sticking to my price of $11000.  That's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close it now. If that's not acceptable, I'll need to consider my other options.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $11000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you at $11250, and I'll throw in a 5-year warranty on the product, which is a $1000 value. That's my final offer. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,9,
