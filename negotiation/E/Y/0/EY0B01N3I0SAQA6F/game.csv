,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12000 for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9500 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $10500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this - let's go with $9750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.",9750.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9750 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9200. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9200.0,Bob,8,
