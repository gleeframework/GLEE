"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $600,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $1,100,000?  This gives you a considerable savings compared to the true value of the product, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair deal considering my budget limitations.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable return on my investment.  How about we meet at $900,000? This represents a significant discount from the true value of the product and should be within your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
