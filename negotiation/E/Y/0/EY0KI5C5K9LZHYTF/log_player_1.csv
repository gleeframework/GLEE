"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, even if it means a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $600,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $1,100,000?  This gives you a considerable savings compared to the true value of the product, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair deal considering my budget limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to what I'd like, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable return on my investment.  How about we meet at $900,000? This represents a significant discount from the true value of the product and should be within your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
