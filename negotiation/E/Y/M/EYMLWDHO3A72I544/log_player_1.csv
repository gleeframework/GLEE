"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true value."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the ""potential"" of the product, I aim to frame the discussion around its possible upside, even if Bob hasn't fully realized it yet.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting point signals that I'm willing to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, $2,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. This is my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump, it's still below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. I believe there's room for negotiation. John's offer is my safety net, but I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,300,000 represents the premium value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise and recognizes the significant value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:** I'm signaling flexibility by decreasing my asking price. The significant drop from $2,300,000 to $2,000,000 may encourage Bob to believe I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Holding Firm (Above Minimum):** The new price is still comfortably above my $1,500,000 minimum and John's standing offer. I'm not yet in a position where I need to accept a loss.
* **Emphasis on ""Fairness"":**  By using the words ""fair compromise"" and ""significant value,"" I aim to reframe the negotiation as a mutually beneficial agreement rather than a win-lose scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $2,000,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above both my absolute minimum of $1,500,000 and John's standing offer.  

While I could try to push for a little more in the next round, there's a risk that Bob will reduce his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
