You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $85.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'll counteroffer at $82.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $82.50 gets you a decent discount and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at the higher price."
