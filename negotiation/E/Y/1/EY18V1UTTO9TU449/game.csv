"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about $10500? That would still be a great deal for you, as you value it at $12000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
