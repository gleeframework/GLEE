Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about $10500? That would still be a great deal for you, as you value it at $12000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.
