``` 

This offer allows for a significant profit for me while still being attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $12,000. It also leaves room for negotiation if he's not willing to pay the full asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $10,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about $10,500? That would still be a great deal for you, as you value it at $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
