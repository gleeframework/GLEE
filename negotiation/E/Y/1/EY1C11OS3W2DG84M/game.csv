"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000?  This is my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
