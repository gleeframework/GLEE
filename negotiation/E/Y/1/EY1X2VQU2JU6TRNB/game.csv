"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a compromise - I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That feels like a fair deal to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
