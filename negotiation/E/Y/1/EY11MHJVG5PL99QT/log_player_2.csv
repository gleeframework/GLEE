```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $850,000 is significantly below its true worth and my minimum acceptable price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair offer considering the value I place on the product and my financial constraints. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a compromise.  While $950,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it demonstrates my willingness to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. It's worth pushing for a lower price, and if we can't agree, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This represents a significant commitment on my part and would allow us to close this deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
