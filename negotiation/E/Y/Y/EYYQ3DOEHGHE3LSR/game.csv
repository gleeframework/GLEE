"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my own analysis and understanding of the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $800,000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential of the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly based on my own analysis and market understanding.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This offer reflects a more realistic price point while acknowledging your interest.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,700,000 remains outside my financial parameters. I'm still committed to acquiring this product, but my maximum budget is $800,000.  If you're unable to come down to that price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
