Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my own analysis and understanding of the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $800,000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential of the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly based on my own analysis and market understanding.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This offer reflects a more realistic price point while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,700,000 remains outside my financial parameters. I'm still committed to acquiring this product, but my maximum budget is $800,000.  If you're unable to come down to that price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $800,000 offer. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss compared to John's guaranteed offer."
