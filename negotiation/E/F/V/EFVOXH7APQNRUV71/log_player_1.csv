Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him some room to negotiate, but it also leaves you a comfortable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above his offer and closer to my initial price. It gives him a bit more room to agree, but it also ensures I get a better deal than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer is now higher than John's offer, and it's just above my minimum.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a decent profit."
