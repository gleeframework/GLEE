Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering at $120 ensures that even if Bob negotiates a slightly lower price, you'll still make a profit above your minimum.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's a risk Bob might reject $120 outright. However, the potential to earn more than your guaranteed $150 from John makes this offer strategically worthwhile."
