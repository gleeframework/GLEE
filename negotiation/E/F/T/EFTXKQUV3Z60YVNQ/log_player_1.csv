Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I need to get for the product. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,000. It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,500? That's the lowest I can go, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,500 is closer to my desired value than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try to get a little closer to my target price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, I'm still not quite there yet. $9,500 is a good offer, but I'm aiming for $10,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be. Let's see if we can find some common ground here. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I've already made a significant concession by offering $9,500, and I'm not willing to go up from there. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about $9,750? That's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, $9,750 is still not enough for me. I'll try one more counteroffer before potentially selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you've been firm on your offer. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget with $10,250. I'm willing to make one last push to try to get to a price that works for both of us. How about $9,800? That's the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm really hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been pushing for a higher price with Bob, but it seems we're at an impasse.  Since time is running out, I'm going to sell to John for $12,000.  While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, getting a guaranteed $12,000 is a better outcome for me than risking a lower offer from Bob or running out of rounds."
