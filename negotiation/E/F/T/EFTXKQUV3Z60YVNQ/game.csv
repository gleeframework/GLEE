"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,000. It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,500? That's the lowest I can go, but I'm really interested in the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, I'm still not quite there yet. $9,500 is a good offer, but I'm aiming for $10,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be. Let's see if we can find some common ground here. ",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I've already made a significant concession by offering $9,500, and I'm not willing to go up from there. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about $9,750? That's as low as I can go.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you've been firm on your offer. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget with $10,250. I'm willing to make one last push to try to get to a price that works for both of us. How about $9,800? That's the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm really hoping we can make a deal.",9800.0,Bob,8,
