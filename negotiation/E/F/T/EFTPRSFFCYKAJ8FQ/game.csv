"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $8,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum. Could you consider something closer to $18,000? I'm willing to be a bit flexible to make this work for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $18,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
