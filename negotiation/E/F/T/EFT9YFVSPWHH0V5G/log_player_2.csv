Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $900000 is simply too low. It's crucial to recognize the true value of this product, which is far greater than that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm proposing $1000000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $950000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value, which is significantly higher. To find common ground, I'm willing to offer a final compromise at $980000. It's a fair price that considers both our needs, and I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a good price, and I respect that. However, I've already made significant concessions, and $960000 still falls short of the product's true value. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm offering one final compromise at $970000. This price is fair to both of us, and it would allow us to move forward with the transaction. Let's make this happen.
