"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, but $9,000 is still a significant premium. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's a clear gap between Alice's offer and your maximum price, suggesting that a better deal is possible.
* **Exploring options:** Rejecting the offer allows you to explore counteroffers and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial proposal ($9,000) demonstrates your desire to save money and puts pressure on Alice.
* **Reasonable expectation:**  While $7,000 is lower than Alice's value ($8,000), it's still within your budget and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **First move:**  By making a strong counteroffer, you gain control of the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your initial counteroffer:**  Alice's offer of $9,500 is higher than your counteroffer of $7,000. 
* **Still too high:** Although slightly lower than her initial offer, $9,500 is still too expensive. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  You have a significant gap between Alice's offer and your maximum price, making further negotiation worthwhile. 
* **Time on your side:**  With 7 rounds remaining, there's still enough time to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer splits the difference between your previous counteroffer ($7,000) and Alice's latest offer ($9,500).
* **Signaling flexibility:** It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to your ideal range.
* **Strategic positioning:**  It allows for potential future negotiation, as Alice might counter with a price slightly lower than $8,000, making a deal likely.
* **Time pressure:** With 6 rounds remaining, increasing the offer slightly makes the negotiation more time-sensitive for Alice, who might be more inclined to accept a deal closer to her value."
