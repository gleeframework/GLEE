"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth $9,500 to me. Can we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go lower than $9,000. This product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure we can find a middle ground. How about we meet at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new counteroffer of $8,200. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I'm not willing to go above that.",8200.0,Bob,4,
