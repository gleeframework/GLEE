"I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Can we meet in the middle?",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm confident the product is worth more. How about $1,250,000? This price reflects the value you'll gain from it. Let's reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,250,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,225,000? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
