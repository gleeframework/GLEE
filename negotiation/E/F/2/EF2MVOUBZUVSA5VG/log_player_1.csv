Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000).
* **Highlight Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the higher price point.
* **Backup Plan:** I have the security of John's offer, so I'm not desperate and can confidently aim high with Bob."
