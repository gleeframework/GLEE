"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $5,500?",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $7,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",6500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",6200.0,Alice,5,
