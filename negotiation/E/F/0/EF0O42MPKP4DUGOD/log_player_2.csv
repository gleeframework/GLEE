"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I've started with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A significant counter will help me understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, there's space to gradually increase my offer over the remaining rounds. 
* **Keep the $8,000 option in mind:** I still have the option of buying from John, so I won't settle for a price too close to that limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming closer to my acceptable range, but $8,500 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I know I can buy it for $8,000 from John, so I'll hold out for a better offer from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price below her previous offer and significantly below her stated value. This strategy allows me to gauge her willingness to move further while keeping a safe distance from my fallback option of $8,000 from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has matched John's price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, as I can get the product for the same price from John without further negotiation."
