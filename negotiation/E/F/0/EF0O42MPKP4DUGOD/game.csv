"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  Let's finalize this deal!",8000.0,Alice,5,
