Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer, as it's still below the product's value to him. However, if he rejects, I'm prepared to counteroffer and ultimately sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John for $8,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and closer to Bob's counteroffer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to Bob. If Bob rejects, I will seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, $8,750 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price and significantly better than selling to John. Further negotiation may not yield a much higher price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
