Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Unknown Value:** Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming to gauge his interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Plan B:**  Knowing I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, I can be more aggressive in my negotiations with Bob. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum value, but I still believe I can get a better price. 
* **Potential for More:**  By rejecting his offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to my initial ask of $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation to potentially maximize my profit. 

I'll now send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price of $1,350,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $1,500,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and see if he's closer to my initial asking price or his own counteroffer. 

I'm confident that this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation, or I can always sell to John as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Falling Short:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it's still not ideal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Bob walking away entirely. 
* **Safety Net:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's more prudent to secure a sale at this point. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
