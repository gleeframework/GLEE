"Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,1,
