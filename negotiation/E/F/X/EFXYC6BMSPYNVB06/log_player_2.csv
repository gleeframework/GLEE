"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, there's no incentive to negotiate. You can get the product from John for the same price, so there's no reason to risk losing the deal by attempting to negotiate with Alice."
