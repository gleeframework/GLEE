Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know can be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get the highest price possible. While she has a guaranteed sale with John, selling to Bob above $1,000,000 means additional profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000.  
* **Confident Approach:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob. This can make Bob more receptive to the offer even though it's above his initial valuation.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a sale above Alice's minimum acceptable price."
