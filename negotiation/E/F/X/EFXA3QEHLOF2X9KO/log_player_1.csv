Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $900,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my goal, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe that $900,000 is a reasonable price. I would like to stick to my original offer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on $900,000, and I'm not willing to go lower than $1,000,000. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm guaranteed $1,000,000 with John, which is more than Bob is offering."
