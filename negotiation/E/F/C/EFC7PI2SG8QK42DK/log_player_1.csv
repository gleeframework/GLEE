Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is already at his maximum valuation of the product.  There's no room for negotiation to get a price I find acceptable. It's best to sell to John and secure the $120."
