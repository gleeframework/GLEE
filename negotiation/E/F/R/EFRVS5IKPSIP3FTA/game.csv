"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value this product brings to your business.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
