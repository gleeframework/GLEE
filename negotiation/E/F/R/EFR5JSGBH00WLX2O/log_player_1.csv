"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $9,000, I can likely get closer to my target of $12,000 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go below $10,200.  This is a final offer from me.  I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  We're down to the last few rounds and it's clear that I'm unlikely to get a better deal from Bob.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 and avoid the risk of getting a lower offer or a deal falling through."
