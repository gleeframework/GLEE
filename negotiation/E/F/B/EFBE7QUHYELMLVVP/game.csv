"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $16000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $16000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $18000. This is still a great price for a product that I'm sure will be of great benefit to you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $17000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",17000.0,Bob,4,
