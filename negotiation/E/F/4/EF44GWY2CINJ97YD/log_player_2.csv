Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Reason: Alice is holding firm at $1,150,000 and explicitly stated she won't go lower.  Since you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, it's better to take that deal and save $50,000. There's no guarantee of getting a better price from Alice with the remaining rounds."
