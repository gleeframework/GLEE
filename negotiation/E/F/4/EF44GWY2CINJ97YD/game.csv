"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the response. I understand you need to make a profit, and $1,250,000 is getting closer. How about we settle at $1,100,000? That gives us both some ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
