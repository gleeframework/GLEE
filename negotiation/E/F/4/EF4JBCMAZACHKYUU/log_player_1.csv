Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1500000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
