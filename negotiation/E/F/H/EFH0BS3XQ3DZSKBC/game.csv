"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. While I understand your perspective, $700,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This recognizes its value while still offering you a significant opportunity.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $850,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",850000.0,Bob,4,
