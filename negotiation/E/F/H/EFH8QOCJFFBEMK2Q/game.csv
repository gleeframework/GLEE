"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is my best compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $760,000?  That's a fair offer.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $760,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $810,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",810000.0,Alice,5,
