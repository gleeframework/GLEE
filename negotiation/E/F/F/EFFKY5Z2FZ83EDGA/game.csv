"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider coming down a bit on the price?  How about $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $7,000? That would be a fair deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,5,
