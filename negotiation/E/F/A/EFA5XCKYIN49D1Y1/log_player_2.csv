"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  You have a clear upper limit of $150, so there's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  I think that's a fair price that will work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  At $122.50, you're still saving money compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation will only get you a few dollars lower.  Accepting this offer is the most financially advantageous choice."
