Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell below $10,000. There are still several rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a better offer from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer the product for $10,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,750 is tempting, I'm still within range of my desired price and there are only a few rounds left.  I'm going to try to push for a higher offer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,250. This is a compromise for both of us, and it's getting closer to a deal we can both agree on.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to meet you at $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can we make it work at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  We're down to two rounds left, and while I would prefer to sell for $10,000, $9,900 is a decent offer and a good compromise. It's important to remember that I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
