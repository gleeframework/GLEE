{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $15,000 for it.  It's a fair price, considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $15,000 gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Mentioning the product's unique value subtly implies it's worth more, potentially making Bob more willing to pay closer to my asking price. 
* **Fairness:**  Framing the price as ""fair"" creates a sense of reasonability.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll assess Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my negotiation strategy.
* **Plan B:**  If the negotiation stalls, I'll be prepared to accept John's $10,000 offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I won't accept his current offer,  I believe there's room for negotiation.  
* **Seeking Higher Value:** I'm confident I can get a better price than $10,000, as the product is worth more to me.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price but still lower than $15,000. 
* **Strategic Approach:** I'll consider factors like Bob's level of interest and the likelihood of him walking away completely.  
* **John as Backup:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is a bit low, but I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  It's still a good deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering the price to $12,500, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This price leaves some room for further negotiation if needed, while ensuring I don't fall below my minimum threshold of $10,000. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. 
* **Flexibility:**  Depending on his response, I might need to be prepared to make another counteroffer, potentially closer to his initial offer or even lower. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a backup if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited Upside:** Further negotiation might result in a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing Bob altogether is significant. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation could be time-consuming and might not lead to a significantly better outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept and Sell:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $11,000. 
* **Maximize Profit:**  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the potential risks and the time already spent negotiating."
