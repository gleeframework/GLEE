"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,250.  How about we split the difference and I pay $10,875? It's a fair compromise for both of us.",10875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,875. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,375. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can see the value in this offer.",11375.0,Alice,5,
