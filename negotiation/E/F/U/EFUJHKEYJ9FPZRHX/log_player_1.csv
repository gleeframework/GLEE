{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for a profit and $100 is significantly higher than your $80 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is still lower than the $120 Bob values the product at, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and direct offer:**  It clearly states your price and leaves room for Bob to respond.

This strategy allows for a potential negotiation where you can adjust your price based on Bob's response while still maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth trying to get a bit more.  You can likely secure a better price by counter-offering and potentially reaching a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $80 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we try $85? I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $85 is a bit lower than your desired outcome, it's still above your minimum and represents a good profit.  Further negotiation may be possible, but it risks losing the deal entirely, especially since John is also offering $80.  It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than risk getting nothing."
