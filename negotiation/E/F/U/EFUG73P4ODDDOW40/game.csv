"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $105 for it.  I'm confident this product is worth the price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $97.50. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",97.5,Bob,4,
