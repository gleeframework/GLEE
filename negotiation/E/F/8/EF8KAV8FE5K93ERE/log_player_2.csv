"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's $150,000 above Alice's own valuation, meaning there's significant room for negotiation.
* **There's no immediate need to accept.** You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, so there's no urgency to settle for a high price.
* **A counteroffer is the best strategy.**  This allows you to initiate a negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within a reasonable range:**  This offer is $50,000 above Alice's valuation but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Message is positive and collaborative:** This emphasizes a willingness to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **It's a strategic move:** This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but isn't willing to overpay.  It sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to be flexible, $850,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm confident the product is worth more, and I'd be happy to settle for $900,000.  This price still allows you to profit significantly, and it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still $100,000 above her own valuation, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **There's still time for a better deal.** We have 7 rounds remaining, so there's no need to rush into an agreement at this price point. 
* **A counteroffer is a strategic move.**  By continuing to negotiate, we might be able to secure a price closer to our target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Alice's valuation:**  This offer is only $75,000 above Alice's valuation, indicating a willingness to meet her halfway.
* **Message remains positive and collaborative:** This continues to emphasize finding a solution that benefits both parties.
* **It's a strategic move:** This counteroffer demonstrates a commitment to the negotiation while still trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to our target.**  $890,000 is only $90,000 above Alice's valuation, and significantly lower than our initial counteroffer.
* **Time is a factor.**  We are at round 5, meaning we only have 5 rounds left. If we keep rejecting, we risk running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **The deal is reasonably profitable.**  While we could try to push for a lower price, accepting this offer still allows us to purchase the product at a significant discount compared to John's price. 

**Conclusion:** It's a good compromise to accept this offer, as it balances our desire for a good deal with the risk of running out of time or having to pay more to John."
