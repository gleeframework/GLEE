Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $925,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $910,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. His ""final offer"" statement suggests he won't go much higher. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
