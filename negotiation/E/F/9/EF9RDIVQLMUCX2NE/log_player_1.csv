``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a good deal, but also leaves room for some potential bargaining. I am willing to go lower to get the deal done, but I want to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it yet. I believe I can get closer to my target price of $11,500 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I want to secure the deal. It's better than selling to John and it's still a good deal for Bob."
