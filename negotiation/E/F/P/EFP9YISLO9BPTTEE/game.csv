"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a fair deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a new price of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a great price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
