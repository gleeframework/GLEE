{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $105, I think I can still get closer to my desired price point of $115."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $108 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That way we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. Can you think about going down to $106? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. I've already been through a few rounds of negotiation, and while I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $106 is still a decent profit and it seems like Bob is not going to go any higher.  It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk losing him completely and having to settle for John's offer of $100."
