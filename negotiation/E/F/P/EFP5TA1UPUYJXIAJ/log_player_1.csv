Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation but still gives you a decent profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** Your minimum is $1,500,000, so you still have room to lower the price if necessary.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're serious about selling while leaving room for negotiation.

This strategy allows you to:

* **Maximize your chances of a deal:** By offering a reasonable price, you increase the likelihood that Bob will accept.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will give you an idea of how strongly he wants the product and what his negotiation tactics might be.
* **Maintain leverage:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always counter-offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you'd prefer. You have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a much better deal.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives you the chance to counter-offer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  $1,200,000 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still trying to get a better price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Maintaining a good margin:**  This price still gives you a decent profit, and it's closer to your minimum value.
* **Positive messaging:**  The message emphasizes fairness and value to encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while remaining profitable and keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a tempting offer, it's still significantly lower than what you would ideally like to receive.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John, who's willing to pay $1,500,000.  It's not worth continuing negotiations with Bob, risking a lower price, when you have a better offer already on the table.  Selling to John guarantees you the maximum profit and eliminates any further negotiation risks."
