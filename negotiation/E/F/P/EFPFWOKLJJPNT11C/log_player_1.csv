"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** Highlighting the value the product holds for Bob can make the offer more attractive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.**  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I want to try to get closer to my target.
* **I can counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.**  I'm confident I can make a counteroffer that will be more enticing to Bob.
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but I'm aiming for a higher price.**  I want to exhaust all negotiation options with Bob before resorting to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, meeting you halfway on our last offers. This price still reflects the significant value the product holds for you. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm proposing $950,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Highlight value again:**  I reiterate the product's value for Bob to reinforce the deal's attractiveness.
* **Enthusiastic tone:**  Using phrases like ""close the deal"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle again.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.**  I'm aiming for a higher price, and I still have time to negotiate with Bob.
* **A counteroffer could bridge the gap.** I can propose a price closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining my profit margin.
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but I'm hoping for a better deal with Bob.**  I want to exhaust all negotiation options with Bob before resorting to John."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about we split the difference again and settle on $935,000?

```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $915,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle again.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$915,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.** I'm aiming for a higher price and I'm not willing to settle for anything less than that.
* **A counteroffer could potentially bridge the gap.** I can try to find a price point that is agreeable to both of us.
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but I'm hoping for a better deal with Bob.** I want to explore all negotiation options before resorting to selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but I'm really hoping we can find a way to close this deal. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and it's a price that still allows me to meet my minimum requirements.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm offering a smaller concession of $925,000, showing I'm willing to be flexible but not giving away too much.

* **Emphasizing Opportunity:** I remind Bob of the ""opportunity"" and encourage him to close the deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  ""Let's not let this opportunity slip away"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to accept."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $925,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already in round 8, leaving only 2 rounds remaining. 
* **Gap Too Large:**  The gap between Bob's offer of $910,000 and my minimum price of $1,200,000 is still significant.  It's unlikely we'll be able to bridge this gap in the remaining rounds.
* **Safe and Secure:** Selling to John at $1,200,000 is a guaranteed way to meet my minimum price. There's no risk of further negotiation with Bob failing. 

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob outweighs the potential benefit of continuing negotiations."
