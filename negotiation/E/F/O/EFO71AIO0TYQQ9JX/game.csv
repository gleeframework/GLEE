"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to start with this number. What are your thoughts?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $11,250? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $10,500 as a compromise. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is more reasonable. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
