{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $175 is far above your budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price or to buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the maximum I'm willing to pay, which is $100. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer.  Hopefully, Alice will be willing to negotiate, knowing that I have a backup option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $140 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get closer to my $100 target.  If we don't reach a deal, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer to $120, showing willingness to compromise while still staying within a reasonable range. This counteroffer is a midpoint between my initial offer of $100 and Alice's last offer of $140.  It's a fair compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $130. While this is still more than my initial budget, it's a good compromise. Buying from Alice for $130 is still more beneficial than buying from John for $100. I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
