Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm setting the price at $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $19,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down. He might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle somewhere above your minimum.
* **Maintain Value Perception:** Offering a price significantly lower than $19,000 might make Bob question the product's value.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since you have a guaranteed sale with John, it's a calculated risk to see if you can secure a higher profit."
