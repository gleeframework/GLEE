Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum, giving you room to potentially negotiate down if Bob counters.  However, it is still a price that is within a reasonable range, hopefully enticing Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows you to explore if Bob is willing to pay a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from the initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price that's still profitable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer and is very close to your minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer maximizes your profit, as selling to John would only net you $1,200,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation."
