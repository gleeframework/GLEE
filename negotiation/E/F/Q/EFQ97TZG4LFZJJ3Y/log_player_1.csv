Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still very interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,000,000. I'd like to meet you at this price, as I've already had an offer from another seller for this price. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is firm at $1,000,000 and even mentions another seller.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000 which is a better outcome for Alice."
