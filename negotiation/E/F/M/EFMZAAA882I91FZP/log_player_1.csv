Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I believe it's a good starting point to leave room for negotiation while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer of $100, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price or even a rejection."
