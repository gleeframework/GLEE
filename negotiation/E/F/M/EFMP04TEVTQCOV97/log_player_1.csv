Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. I'm offering the product for slightly less than my minimum acceptable price ($120) hoping to quickly secure a deal with Bob. However, I'm also keeping John as a backup option in case Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to $108.  I think that's a fair compromise, and it's still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $120 from John. It's better to secure a sale than to risk going back and forth with Bob and potentially ending up with an even lower price."
