Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) than my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $130, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at my minimum. 
* **Considering the Alternative:** I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at $100.  This knowledge allows me to be firmer in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's initial rejection wasn't a strong ""no,"" suggesting he's still interested.  I'll counter to aim for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not accepting it outright.  This shows flexibility while still striving for a higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge Bob's true interest and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $115 is still a good profit over my minimum of $100. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away.  The difference between $115 and a potential higher offer isn't worth the risk of losing him as a buyer. 
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal now means I can move on to other potential sales."
