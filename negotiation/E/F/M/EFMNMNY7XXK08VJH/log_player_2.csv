"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $100. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John for $100 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $90. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $150, but still within the range of what the product is worth to me.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, and I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm going to reject and try to negotiate further. There's still room for Alice to come down in price, and I'm confident I can get it closer to my target of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $105. This is still below Alice's current offer of $130, and closer to my budget. It demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a compromise and accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is a good price, it's still above my budget. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but I'm not sure how much further she'll come down. Rather than risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation, I'm going to take the guaranteed deal from John at $100.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
