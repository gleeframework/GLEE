,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $80, which is $90. However, I can do better than that. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $95, which is $87.50. Can you consider that price?",87.5,Bob,4,
