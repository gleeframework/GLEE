"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your minimum value for the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, at $900,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can offer it to you for $925,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
