"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm looking to sell for a fair price. I'm thinking of starting at $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I was really hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's my limit. Can we meet somewhere in between?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $130? It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $125, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at $125?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $128? It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $128 is still a bit too high for me. I'm at my limit, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at $125. Can you meet me at $125?",125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're at your limit, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to make one final offer. How about we meet at $126? It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",126.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one final offer, but $126 is still a bit too high for me. I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I'm willing to buy the product from John for $100 instead.",100.0,Bob,10,
