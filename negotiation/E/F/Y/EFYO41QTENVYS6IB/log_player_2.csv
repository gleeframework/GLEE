Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I have to consider the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is better than her initial offer, it's still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  I need to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget. To make progress, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I need to continue negotiating. I'm hoping she'll come closer to my last offer of $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. To find common ground, I'm offering $950,000.

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my budget.  I need to continue negotiating to see if we can bridge the gap and reach a deal within my price range.  I'm hoping to get her down to my last offer of $950,000.  If she doesn't come down further, I'm prepared to go to John, but I want to see if I can get a better deal first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point of diminishing returns. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to see a bit more movement from you. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last counteroffer is still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  With only one round left, it's unlikely we'll be able to reach a deal.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer, which is within my budget."
