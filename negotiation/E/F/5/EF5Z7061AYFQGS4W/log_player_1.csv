Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a high price, but it's truly worth it. I'm confident you'll see the value in it."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and establish a strong starting point.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price reflects the value I see in our potential partnership, and I'm confident this deal will be beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my target, it's still below the $1,000,000 I could get from John. I'm going to try to push Bob a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our potential for future collaborations.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $950000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $925000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and a price that reflects the value of this product. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'm not getting my initial asking price, this deal is still within my acceptable range and guarantees me a profit.  Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer, but it's still not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with him. I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer and will provide a smooth transaction."
