"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price reflects the value I see in our potential partnership, and I'm confident this deal will be beneficial for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $900000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our potential for future collaborations.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $950000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $925000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and a price that reflects the value of this product. Let's make this deal happen.",925000.0,Bob,6,
