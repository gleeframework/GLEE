Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still exceeding your minimum ($150). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
