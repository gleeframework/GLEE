**Reasoning:**

While I'd still like to get the price closer to $8,500, Alice is clearly anchoring around the $9,000 mark.  We're getting into later rounds, and further haggling might annoy her. Accepting at $9,100 secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of her withdrawing the offer or the negotiation stalling completely."
