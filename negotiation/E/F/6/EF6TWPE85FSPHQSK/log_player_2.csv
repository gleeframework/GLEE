"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is significantly higher than the product's value to Alice ($800,000), but lower than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, I'm going to need to come in lower.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a bold stance here, making a significant counteroffer that is closer to the product's value to Alice. This puts pressure on Alice to either accept or come back with a lower counteroffer. Bob is still within his budget, and this offer shows he is serious about negotiating a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is too far off from where I see the value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer to $1,200,000. While Bob still wants to pay less, this offer is significantly lower than his maximum budget and is more than the product's value to Alice. Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product while saving a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John. Further negotiation might be possible, but accepting the current offer minimizes risk and ensures the purchase at a favorable price."
