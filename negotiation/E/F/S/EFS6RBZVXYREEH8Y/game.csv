"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to recoup some of my investment. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get closer to your desired price while still being within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $875,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000 as a final compromise. This price is still a good value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $875,000. I'm willing to go up to $890,000 as a final compromise. This gives you a good profit and ensures I get a fair deal. Let's close this deal and make this happen!",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go down to $895,000. This price is a good compromise, and I believe it's fair for both parties.  Let's seal this deal! ",895000.0,Alice,7,
