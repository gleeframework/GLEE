Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
