# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe it could be very beneficial for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. I'm not willing to pay $12,000 for the product, as it's above my budget of $8,000. I'll see if I can find a better deal elsewhere.
