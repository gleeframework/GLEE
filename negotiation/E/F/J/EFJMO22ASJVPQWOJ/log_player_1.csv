Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 gives Bob the impression of a deal while leaving me space to potentially negotiate down a little if needed.
* **Urgency:**  Phrases like ""a steal""  add a sense of urgency and value. 

By aiming high initially, I increase the chances of securing a price closer to my desired outcome."
