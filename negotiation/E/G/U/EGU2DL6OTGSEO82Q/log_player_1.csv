Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but leaves some room for negotiation.  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so this offer is within his range and might encourage him to accept quickly. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his valuation, and it's closer to my desired price point. Hopefully, this will encourage him to close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While I would ideally prefer to get closer to my initial offer, accepting this offer is still a better choice than selling to John.  I'm confident that I can find other opportunities to make up the difference in future transactions."
