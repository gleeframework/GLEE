Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, knowing she has John as a backup.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $1,000,000.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high price to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know if Bob is aware of John's offer. If Bob knew about John, he would have less incentive to offer more than $1,200,000."
