Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,000,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly willing to pay a significant amount for the product. While $950,000 is a good offer, there's still room for negotiation. We are aiming for at least $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $975,000? This represents a significant saving for you compared to my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementing his offers in smaller amounts, indicating he's getting closer to his maximum. We're still aiming for at least $950,000 and have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to come down slightly to $962,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 962500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're applying a bit of pressure by calling it our final offer while still leaving some room for Bob to counter. This approach aims to secure a price above $950,000 while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While we were aiming for a higher price, Bob's increments are getting smaller, and we're running out of rounds. Accepting $920,000 is significantly better than John's offer of $800,000, and the risk of Bob walking away is increasing. It's time to secure a good deal rather than holding out for an ideal but less certain outcome."
