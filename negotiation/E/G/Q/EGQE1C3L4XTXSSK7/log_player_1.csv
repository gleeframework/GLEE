Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,300,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being a profitable deal for me. If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is not acceptable. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a compromise that still leaves me with a profit while being closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, he'll see this as a reasonable price and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price point.  I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000 and avoid further negotiations."
