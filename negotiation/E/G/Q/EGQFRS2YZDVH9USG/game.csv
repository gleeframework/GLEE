"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it's worth the same to you. To demonstrate my good faith, I'm willing to offer it to you at $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on this product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I propose we aim for a more reasonable price closer to $800,000. I hope this suggestion aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000 as a compromise. This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's within a reasonable range for a product of this caliber. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my financial situation, $950,000 is still beyond my reach. I would like to suggest a price closer to $750,000, which I believe is fair for both parties. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position and your budget constraints.  However, $750,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000 as a final compromise. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  If you're truly interested, I urge you to consider this final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget, Alice. However, $900,000 is still too high for me. Considering the market value and my financial situation, I would like to propose a price closer to $850,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you can consider.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been trying to be flexible, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000.  This is my final offer.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I urge you to consider it. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",875000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence in negotiating, Alice. However, $875,000 is still out of my budget. I would like to propose a price closer to $825,000, which I believe is fair and reasonable for both of us. I hope this proposal is more acceptable.",825000.0,Bob,8,
