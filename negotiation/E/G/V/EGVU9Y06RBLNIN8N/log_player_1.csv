Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message can make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the product's potential value to Bob, even though I don't reveal the actual worth to me. 

I'm hoping Bob will either accept this offer or counter with a price closer to my minimum. This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,200 is significantly below my minimum of $10,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a large loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest in the product.  I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Future Rounds:** I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next few rounds. There's still a possibility of getting closer to my target price. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $9,000, hoping to find a compromise that's fair for both of us. I'll keep an eye on the number of rounds remaining and the possibility of selling to John if negotiations become too lengthy or unfavorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,200 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $9,000?  It's a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,000, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving forward. 

I'm aiming to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us while still earning a reasonable amount for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. I can do $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than before, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to accept a significant loss on this product.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already on round 4, and time is running out.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still a chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, or at least reach a point where selling to John becomes a more attractive option.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer again, possibly with a price closer to $8,800. I'll also keep a close eye on the remaining rounds and be ready to sell to John if it becomes necessary.  The goal is to maximize my earnings while balancing the time constraint."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  How about $8,800? It's a fair price, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm making a smaller concession, lowering my price to $8,800. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Progress:** I'm highlighting the fact that we're getting closer to an agreement, urging Bob to consider my offer.
* **Finality:** I'm using a phrase like ""finalize this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage a decision. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to persuade Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to consider selling to John if the negotiations continue to stall.  We're now halfway through the rounds, so time is becoming a more significant factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $8,600. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher, it's still below my minimum of $10,000. I'm not willing to accept such a large loss.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're now in round 6, and time is running out. We're also getting close to the point where selling to John is a more attractive option.
* **Possible Counteroffer:**  I'm willing to give Bob one more chance, but I need to counter with a price that gets us closer to my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price closer to $8,800 again, hoping to push Bob towards a more acceptable price. If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price that works for both of us.  How about $8,750?  It's a compromise, and I believe it's fair considering the value of this product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a final compromise by raising my counteroffer to $8,750. This shows flexibility while still trying to stay close to my minimum.
* **Urgency and Compromise:** I'm using phrases like ""make this deal happen"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Finality:**  I'm subtly implying that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely sell to John in the next round.  The risk of not closing a deal with Bob is high, and I'm nearing my deadline. I'm hoping this final counteroffer will be enough to persuade Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I really need to be at or below $8,500. Can you meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're on round 8, and only two rounds remain.  It's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating with Bob. 
* **Low Offer:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum, and his willingness to only consider that price indicates a lack of flexibility. 
* **John's Offer is More Attractive:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is now the more financially advantageous option. It guarantees a better price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely.

**Conclusion:**

While I'm disappointed to not reach an agreement with Bob, selling to John is the best strategy at this point.  It ensures I receive a fair price for my product and minimizes the potential for further losses."
