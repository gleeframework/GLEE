"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my ideal price.  I want to see if I can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal value. This will likely prompt Alice to counter back, but it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825000. This is my final offer for now. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay right now. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if it's acceptable."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step closer to Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price. I'm stating it's my final offer to create a sense of urgency and potentially encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $800000, Bob. I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is my final offer, and I'm not going to go any higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $850,000 is still a good deal for me, considering I can buy it from John for $1,000,000. While I would prefer a lower price, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant difference. It's best to accept and save $150,000."
