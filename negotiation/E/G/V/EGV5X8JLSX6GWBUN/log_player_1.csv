Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is still significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $17,000? I believe this price reflects a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen. However, I need a price that reflects its true worth.  Let's settle this right now: $14,500.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm serious about this product, $14,500 is still out of my price range. I can offer $13,000, which I believe is a fair and final offer. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

While Bob is getting closer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, and it's not worth risking losing that for a slightly higher potential gain from Bob."
