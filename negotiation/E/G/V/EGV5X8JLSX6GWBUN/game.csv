"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is still significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $17,000? I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen. However, I need a price that reflects its true worth.  Let's settle this right now: $14,500.  This is my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm serious about this product, $14,500 is still out of my price range. I can offer $13,000, which I believe is a fair and final offer. Let's make this happen.",13000.0,Bob,6,
