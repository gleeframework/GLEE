"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $8,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise. It's closer to my price point, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to finalize this.",8750.0,Bob,4,
