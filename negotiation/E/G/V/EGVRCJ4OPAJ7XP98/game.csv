"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $900,000?  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,050,000? This would give us both a good deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position. To be fair, your product is worth a lot.  How about we split the difference and agree on $975,000? It's a strong offer, and I think it would benefit us both.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,012,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been a tough negotiator! I respect your position, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $993,750. I think this is a very fair price and shows how serious I am about getting this deal done.",993750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $993,750 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,003,125? This price is more than fair, considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1003125.0,Alice,7,
