Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $900,000?  Let me know what you think.

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell at such a low price.  I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
