"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its potential and my own budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my maximum budget, but still leaves room for negotiation.

* **Setting the tone:**  I'm being polite but firm, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product but not willing to overpay."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer,  the product's intrinsic worth and potential necessitate a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to the middle:** I'm increasing my offer, but staying within my budget. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the compromise:** I'm emphasizing the fact that I'm moving closer to her price, making the counteroffer more appealing.
* **Reiterating fairness:** I'm still trying to find a price that's fair for both parties."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,050,000 is still out of my price range.  To make this work, I can offer $975,000.
