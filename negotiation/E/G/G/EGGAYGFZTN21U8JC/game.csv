"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its potential and my own budget constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer,  the product's intrinsic worth and potential necessitate a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept for this product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,050,000 is still out of my price range.  To make this work, I can offer $975,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
