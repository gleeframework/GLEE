"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. My initial offer for the product is $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1000000, which I believe is a fair price for this exceptional product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1000000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $950000 is enough to reflect the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1000000, which would be $975000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
