"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $14,000.  I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair compromise. ",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $15,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous one. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
