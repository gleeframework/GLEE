"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item at a discount from its true worth of $15000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's $15,000 price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  This product is worth $15,000 to me, so a price closer to your value is a better deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is a fair price that still allows you to get a great deal, while also allowing me to earn a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly less than John's price of $15,000 and only $500 more than Bob's initial counteroffer.  It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a small price decrease, and the risk of losing the deal to another buyer increases with each round.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision in this scenario."
