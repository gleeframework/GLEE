Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750, which is closer to my budget and a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,875. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to close this sale.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has already rejected a lower price of $10,750, and now Alice is offering $10,875. While he can try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John is increasing.  It's a good deal for Bob, and it's likely Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
