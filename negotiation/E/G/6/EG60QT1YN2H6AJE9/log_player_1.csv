{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum ($120) but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident I can make a profit, and if Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $100? It's still a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum ($120), but I've lowered the price to show flexibility and encourage further negotiation.  I believe this is a fair offer that balances my profit needs with Bob's budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about $92? I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the profit margin I'd like to achieve. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit. I believe there's still potential to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $92 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $96? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 96}
```

I'm offering a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer while still ensuring I make a reasonable profit. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us. I'm hopeful this will be accepted, but I'm prepared to sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $88. That's as low as I can go, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $88 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for a loss. I've made several counteroffers, and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price. Therefore, I'm going to accept John's offer of $120 to ensure I make a profit."
