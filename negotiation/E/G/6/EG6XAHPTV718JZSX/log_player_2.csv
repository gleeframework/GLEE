"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. I know this is a valuable asset, and I believe it's worth every penny to you. It's a great opportunity to acquire a product that aligns perfectly with your needs. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are looking to save money, and Alice's offer is at your maximum price.  You can get the same product from John for the same price. Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John, which doesn't change the price, but it gives you the option to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice later if you want."
