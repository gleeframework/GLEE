"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. This is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too far below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,750?  This still leaves some room for profit for both of us.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $11,750 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $10,500? That would really help me make this work.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,500 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",11250.0,Alice,5,
