Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too far below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,750?  This still leaves some room for profit for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,500 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to move on to other buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is presenting this as her final offer, and it's still above John's price.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice won't budge and we'll end up with nothing.  It's better to secure the product from John at our target price of $12,000 than to risk getting stuck with no deal."
