``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's a little bit lower than what I value the product at, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also conveys that I'm willing to compromise and hopefully encourages Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget constraint. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. While it's tempting to take $10,000, I can get more from John, and I'm confident that I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still feel like I can negotiate a bit higher. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $10,250 is getting very close, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,375? This is the absolute lowest I can go without losing too much. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10375}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $10,375. I'd like to make a final offer of $10,000. If you're willing to sell it to me at this price, I'll make it worth your while. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  I've already countered a few times, and I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob. John's offer is more than what I'm looking for, so I'm going to sell to him."
