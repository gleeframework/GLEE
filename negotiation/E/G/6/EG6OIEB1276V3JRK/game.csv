"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm happy to consider a price closer to $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $16,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to get the product within my budget.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but I'll throw in a small concession. I'll sell it to you for $16,250, and I'll also include a free accessory that adds significant value to the product. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer and the added accessory, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000, but that's my absolute top limit.  If you can meet me there, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",16000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but I'll throw in an additional warranty that covers any potential issues for an extra year. That way, you'll have complete peace of mind with your purchase. How about we meet at $16,000, and I'll include the extended warranty?",16000.0,Alice,7,
