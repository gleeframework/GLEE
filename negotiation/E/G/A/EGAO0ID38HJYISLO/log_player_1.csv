"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, so I'm not afraid to ask for a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that right away. I'll try to get a better price.  I have 8 rounds left, and I'm not in a rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $900,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still  I'm holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is getting closer to my desired price. It's more than what John is offering, and with several rounds still remaining, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially getting a lower price is too high.  I'm accepting this offer to secure a good price."
