"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. Since Alice is offering a price significantly below your maximum, it's worth exploring if you can get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's 20% lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating but also leaves room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $900,000 is a good price, it's still above my target. Since I have more rounds to negotiate, I'll try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $850,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get a better deal than Alice's last offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to meet me in the middle."
