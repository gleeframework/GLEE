Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob at $11,500. This is higher than his perceived value of $10,000, but still lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* This offer gives me a good starting point for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly.
* I'm leaving room to negotiate with Bob, while also ensuring I get a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable value. 
* This strategy allows me to explore the possibility of a win-win scenario while also keeping the option to sell to John for $12,000 as a backup."

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $10,500 is below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my minimum value.
* I'm keeping the option to sell to John for $12,000 as a backup if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* My previous offer of $11,500 was rejected.
* I'm now offering $11,000, which is a compromise. 
* This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer of $10,500, but it's closer to his perceived value.
* By lowering the price slightly, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach an agreement with Bob without having to sell to John at a lower price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* We've already gone through a couple of rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're stuck in a stalemate.  
* I'm not willing to keep lowering the price further, and risking a significant loss.
* By selling to John, I can secure my minimum acceptable value and avoid the potential of further negotiations with Bob that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome.
* This decision ensures I receive the price I'm comfortable with and minimizes the risk of a loss."
