You can likely get a better price from Alice than $11,500. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  You're aiming for a price closer to your $10,000 limit, but are willing to pay a bit more to avoid switching to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer is still higher than you're willing to pay, but it's getting closer. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can meet in the middle."

This counteroffer is a compromise, slightly higher than your previous offer but still lower than Alice's.  You're showing a willingness to negotiate, but also pushing for a price closer to your limit."
