"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $9,000? It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $8,750? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from your offer.  Let's try $8,900. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,500. I'm willing to make one more offer, so how about we try $8,700? I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",8700.0,Bob,6,
