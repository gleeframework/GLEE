"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for $100 from John, so it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's offer of $119."
