Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, given its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This ensures you're not leaving money on the table.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a substantial profit.
* **It sets a strong starting point:** This shows you're serious about negotiating a fair price.

This approach allows you to see how Bob reacts and then adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and what the product is worth to Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. 

**Next steps:**  You'll need to craft a counteroffer to Bob that's higher than his $950,000 but still below your initial $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This would leave us both with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's. It shows a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Maintain Value:**  $1,050,000 is still a good price for you, ensuring a significant profit.
* **Keep Negotiation Open:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further discussion. 

By offering a lower price, you're encouraging Bob to come up on his offer. If he still refuses, you can then assess if you want to further negotiate or take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land around $1,000,000. How about $1,025,000? That's a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my desired price point. While I could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a good chance he'll dig in his heels. 

Here's why accepting is the best option:

* **Significant Profit:** $1,025,000 is still a great profit, exceeding my minimum of $800,000 by a substantial amount.
* **Time Efficiency:** Continuing to negotiate could take a lot of time and may not result in a significantly better offer. 
* **Potential for Future Business:**  A successful deal with Bob now could lead to future business opportunities.

By accepting, I secure a good deal, avoid risking a lower offer from Bob, and potentially open the door for future collaborations."
