Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 gives Bob a good deal (saving $1,000) while also allowing you to maximize your profit beyond your minimum sale price to John. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob (who values the product more) and maximizing your potential profit."
