"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. While I believe this product offers significant value, $1,050,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.
