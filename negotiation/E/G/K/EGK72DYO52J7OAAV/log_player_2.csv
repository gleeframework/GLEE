# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000. It's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John for your maximum budget."
