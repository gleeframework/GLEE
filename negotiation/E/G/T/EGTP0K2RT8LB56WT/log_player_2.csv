"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is above his maximum budget, and he has a guaranteed alternative with John.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice first, as he might be able to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

Bob should start by making a bold counteroffer. He knows Alice wants to sell the product, so he's going to start with a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer. This sets the stage for negotiation and shows Alice he's serious about saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He has a guaranteed alternative with John, so he has room to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

```

Bob is sticking to his strategy of negotiating down. He's increased his offer from the previous round, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. He's showing Alice he's willing to compromise, but also that he's serious about getting the product at a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, it's still a little higher than what he's willing to pay. He can afford to keep negotiating with Alice and see if she'll go lower.  He knows John is a sure thing, but there's still potential for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob is getting close to his limit, but he's still trying to save some money. He's increased his offer again, but he's still below Alice's current price. This shows Alice that he's serious about getting the product but also that he's not going to overpay."
