Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing I have John as a backup.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, while still staying significantly above his perceived value.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  The message frames the price as a ""special deal,"" potentially making Bob feel like he's getting a discount even though it's still very profitable for me.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject this offer, but it's a calculated risk. I'm prioritizing maximizing my potential profit. If Bob rejects, I still have John to ensure I meet my minimum price."
