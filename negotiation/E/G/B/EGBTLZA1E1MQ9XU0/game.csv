"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle -  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for the product.  Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $10,000. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $9,750 is still too far below my desired price. Let's compromise again - how about $10,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  I'm getting closer to a price I can agree on.  Would you be willing to do $10,000 even?  That would seal the deal for me.",10000.0,Bob,6,
