Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $650,000, but I'm still a bit above that. Considering the value I believe the product holds, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think we're getting close to a deal.

Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still a bit above that. Considering the value I believe the product holds, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $760,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $750,000. At this point, we're getting very close to her likely bottom line.  While I might be able to push her down another $10,000, the risk of her walking away and the potential savings are no longer worth the additional rounds of negotiation. $760,000 is a good price considering it's significantly less than John's offer."
