Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the walk-away point:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, so you shouldn't sell below that price.
* **Finding the middle ground:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, and you value it at a minimum of $1,500,000. Offering it at $1,250,000 creates a potential win-win scenario.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid further negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that could be attractive to him."
