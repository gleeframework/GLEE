"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to come down to $850,000? This would give us both a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but unfortunately, $950,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value to me and the fact that I'm willing to close the deal quickly.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the value I place on it, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value to both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
