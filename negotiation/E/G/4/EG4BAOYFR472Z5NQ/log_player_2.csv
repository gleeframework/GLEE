Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Considering your offer of $9,000, I can meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I think you'll find it's a great value.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her last offer.  While you *might* be able to negotiate her down another $25, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price. Buying from John guarantees you your maximum price point."
