"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price. It's the price that John is willing to pay, so there's no reason to go lower unless Bob makes a compelling counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find some middle ground before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This is still significantly more than Bob's offer, but it shows flexibility and opens the door for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's a slight improvement, I'm not willing to accept it yet.  I'll make another counteroffer to try and reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm dropping my price further to $10,500. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's getting closer to his range.  With only 5 rounds left, I need to start making concessions to ensure I can close a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly what the product is worth to him.  It's a fair price, and with only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for more.  I'll accept his offer and close the sale."
