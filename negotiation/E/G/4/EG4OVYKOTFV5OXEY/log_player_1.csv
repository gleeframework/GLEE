Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this price is fair considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product,  $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is too low, below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While I can potentially sell to John for that amount, I'd prefer to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob. I still have 8 rounds to try and reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal for you considering its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a good price for your product, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I've got 6 rounds remaining and John is willing to pay $1,500,000, so I'm not in a rush to close this deal. I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price in hopes of getting closer to my desired amount."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and my need to get a good return. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
