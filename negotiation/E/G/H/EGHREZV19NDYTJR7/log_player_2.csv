"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000. This means there's potential to save money by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Starting with a counteroffer of $900,000 is a reasonable first step. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  Accepting the offer for $950,000 saves Bob $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation could potentially lower the price, the risk of Alice rejecting and then moving further away from the desired price exists. It's a calculated risk that Bob can take to secure the product at a reasonable price."
