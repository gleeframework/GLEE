"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my budget. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll need to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $11000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
