{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $8000 to you, and I'm still paying more than its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is a good price, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I still have 8 rounds left and can always sell to John if I don't get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $9,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,500?  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I'm aiming for.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your value, but $9500 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $9250. This is a compromise that shows I'm serious about buying, and it's still significantly less than what I'm willing to pay from another seller. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,250 is getting closer to my desired price, I still have 6 rounds left and can see if I can get a little closer to $9,500. I still have the option to sell to John if I don't get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,400.  This price reflects both of our needs and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can finally close this! "", ""product_price"": 9400}
