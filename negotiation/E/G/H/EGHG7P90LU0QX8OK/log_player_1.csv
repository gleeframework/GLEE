Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, given its potential. I'm willing to part with it for $900,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so aiming for a price closer to that figure maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $900,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a strong fallback position. This allows for a more confident and potentially less flexible negotiation stance with Bob."
