"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good price considering the value to me is $15,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and saving $4,000."
