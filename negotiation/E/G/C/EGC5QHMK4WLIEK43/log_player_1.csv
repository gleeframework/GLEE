Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential for you, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the substantial return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with a price slightly below your minimum ($1,500,000) allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate upwards. 
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasize the product's value to Bob, potentially encouraging him to accept the offer even if it's slightly above his initial perceived worth.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a multi-round negotiation, you might start with a higher offer and adjust based on Bob's responses."
