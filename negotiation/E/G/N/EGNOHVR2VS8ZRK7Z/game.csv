"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I understand your position. How about we split the difference again and settle on $10,000 even?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit short on budget, and $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",9800.0,Bob,6,
