Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, and $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $9,800 offer. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed $10,000."
