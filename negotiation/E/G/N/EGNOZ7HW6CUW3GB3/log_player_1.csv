Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $10,000. I know this is a valuable product that would benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly explain why the price is above $8,000, it subtly implies the product's value might be higher to Bob than he realizes. 
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum price. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while minimizing risk."
