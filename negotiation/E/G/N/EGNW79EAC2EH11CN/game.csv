"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1100000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're getting close to your budget, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit, and $950000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'll meet you at $1050000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to consider this a final offer, but I need to be fair to myself.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product, and I hope you can understand that this is as high as I can go.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one last concession. However, $975000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'll meet you at $1025000, but that's my absolute final offer. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make a profit.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made some concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1025000. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product, and I hope you can see that this is as high as I can go.",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made several concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a deal. I'll meet you at $1020000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1020000.0,Alice,9,

I'm willing to pay $995000 for the product, and I hope you can see that this is as high as I can go.
