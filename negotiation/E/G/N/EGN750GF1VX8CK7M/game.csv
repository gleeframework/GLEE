"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both room for a profitable deal. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I really need to stay within budget, and I'm not sure I can justify the full $1,250,000.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This would allow me to cover my costs and still give you a fair price. Let me know if that works for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $1,180,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget.",1180000.0,Bob,4,
