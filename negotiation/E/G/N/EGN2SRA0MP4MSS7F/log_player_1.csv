Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing within a range profitable for me.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 gives me leverage. I'm willing to walk away from a deal with Bob if it's too low."
