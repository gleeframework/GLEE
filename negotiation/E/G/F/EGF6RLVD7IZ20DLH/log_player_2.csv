"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly better than John's, but there is still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get the product for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer will allow Bob to attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $1,000,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good price for Bob, especially compared to John's offer of $1,500,000. There's a good chance Alice might not budge further, so accepting the offer is the best way to secure the product for a decent price."
