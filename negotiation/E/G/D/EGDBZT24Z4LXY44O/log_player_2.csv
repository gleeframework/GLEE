"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a fortune, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. It's a steal considering its true value! If you're interested, let's talk further. If not, I'm confident I can find another buyer who will see its potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm interested in saving as much money as possible. Since I can buy the product from John for $800,000, which is lower than Alice's offer of $900,000, I will choose to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John.
