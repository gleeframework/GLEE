{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal. Bob can counteroffer and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He's offering a price that's still a good deal for Alice (above her value of $800,000) but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about negotiating and sets the stage for further back-and-forth."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and still provides Alice with a profit.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid further negotiation."
