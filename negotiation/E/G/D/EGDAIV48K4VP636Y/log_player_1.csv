Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000.  This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't leave too much money on the table.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is still too low for me, especially considering he values the product at $1,200,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise,  moving closer to Bob's offer while still keeping my value in mind. It's important to show I'm willing to negotiate but also to hold my ground on price.  I'm hoping this will get us closer to a deal."
