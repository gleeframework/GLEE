This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer, but significantly lower than my previous offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

While $10,000 is closer to my desired range than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I can get from John.  Given the opportunity to sell for my desired price, I'll choose to sell to John."
