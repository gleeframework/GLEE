"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm confident it will be a great asset for you.  My initial price is $1800000. This reflects the true value and potential of this product.  I'm open to discussing the price further, but I believe this is a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is way out of my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800000. It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value I see in this product. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1300000?  This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a great deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1300000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer and a good compromise. This offer reflects my budget limitations and the value I place on this product. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, and I'm willing to keep negotiating.  However, $900000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. To show you my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and gives you a good deal.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1100000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a fair compromise considering we're both meeting in the middle.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still too low for me.  I'm prepared to be flexible and make a final concession.  Let's settle at $1050000. This price is a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves room for you to make a profit.  Let's reach an agreement and move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  This price reflects my budget constraints, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
