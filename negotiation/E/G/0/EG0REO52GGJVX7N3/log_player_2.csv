"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1400000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's a good deal for her, you can potentially get a better price by counter-offering and negotiating."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer you $1,250,000 for it.  This is the highest I can go at this time. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1250000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to go lower. You can also weigh the risk of rejecting this offer and potentially losing the product altogether. However, since John is willing to sell you the product for $1,200,000, you have a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,350,000 is closer, but still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1320000. This is my final offer in this range. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,320,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While you could continue to counter-offer, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. Given that you have a guaranteed deal with John at your target price, it's the most prudent decision to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation."
