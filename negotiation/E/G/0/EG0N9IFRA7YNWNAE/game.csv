"Hi Alice, thanks for your latest offer, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on $11250. I'm still thinking more along the lines of $10800. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on that price. I'm also considering buying from John, who is willing to sell it to me for $15000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at $10800.",10800.0,Bob,6,
