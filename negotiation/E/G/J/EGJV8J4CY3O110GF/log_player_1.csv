Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value it holds to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price closer to my own valuation. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a significant concession for me.  This is my final offer, and I hope you'll agree to it. If not, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm hoping for. With only 4 rounds left, there's a significant chance we won't be able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.  To guarantee I get at least my minimum, I'll sell the product to John for $800,000."
