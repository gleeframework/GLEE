"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering the market value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me and your budget. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget.  You should reject this offer and make another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. Since you have the option to buy from John for $12,000, it's the most financially sensible option. There's no guarantee Alice will come down to your desired price, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the product to another buyer."
