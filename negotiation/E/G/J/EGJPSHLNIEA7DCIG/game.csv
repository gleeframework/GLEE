"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering the market value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit outside my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me and your budget. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise. Let me know if you're open to that.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
