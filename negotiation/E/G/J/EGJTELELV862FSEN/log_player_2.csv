"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, while still reflecting the inherent value of what's being offered.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price, potentially somewhere between $900,000 and $1,000,000, before considering buying from John."
