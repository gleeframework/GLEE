Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $11,000, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point."

Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get more, $12,000 is a good price and it's likely the best I can do.  It's also more than what I would get selling to John."
