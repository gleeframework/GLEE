"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product that I believe will revolutionize your business. I'm confident that you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $950000. However, I still think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go up to $975000. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to what I'm looking for. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on a price.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made several concessions, but I'm still not willing to go above $975000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, and that's my final offer.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're at an impasse, but I'm not willing to give up on the sale just yet. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get at least $1000000 for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1025000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping you'll reconsider.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go above $975000. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't agree on a price. I'm not interested in buying the product from you for more than $975000. Please let's end the negotiation here.,975000.0,Bob,10,
