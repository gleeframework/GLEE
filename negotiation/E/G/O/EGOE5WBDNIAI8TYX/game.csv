"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $125. It's still a great value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $127. It's still a great value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",127.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me.  However, $127 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",120.0,Bob,6,
