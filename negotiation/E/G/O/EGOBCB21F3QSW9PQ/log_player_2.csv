"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for it. This price reflects not only its worth but also allows us to maintain a fair transaction. I trust you'll find it a reasonable offer considering its high value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  It's worth seeing if Alice might be willing to lower her price."
