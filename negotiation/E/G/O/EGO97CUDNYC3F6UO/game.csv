"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $9,250. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, but I'm willing to compromise to close the deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, which is a good price for both of us. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free maintenance package, which adds significant value to the product. I'm still at $9,000, but I think it's a fair price considering the extras.",9000.0,Alice,7,
