"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth discussing a price of $1,200,000, considering its value to you is $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I believe the product is valuable, but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000. Would that be feasible?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than this price, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
