"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot.  I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and gives me some leverage.
* **Optimistic Tone:** I'm expressing confidence in the product's value to create a positive first impression. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm framing my offer as a starting point, not a hard limit, to encourage Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value and Leverage:**  While $95 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I have leverage because I know John is willing to pay $100, so I can afford to be a bit more demanding.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  He's already shown interest and is willing to pay close to my minimum.
* **Avoiding a ""Loss"":** Selling to John would be a guaranteed $100, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll save you the hassle of finding another deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair"" price for both of us, suggesting that it's a win-win situation.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a little pressure by mentioning the hassle of finding another deal, implying that he might miss out on a good opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still committed to finding a deal within my budget. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $100 meets my minimum acceptable value for the product.
* **No Further Negotiation:**  There's no real incentive to try and squeeze out more money.  Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away, leaving me with only John's $100 offer.
* **Time is Money:** It's important to make a decision to avoid wasting more time.  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation.

By accepting Bob's offer, I get my minimum desired price and avoid any further risk of losing the deal."
