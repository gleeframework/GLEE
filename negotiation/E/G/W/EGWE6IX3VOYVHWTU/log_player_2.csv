"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum of $10,000. There are rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's $12,000 price, aiming to push the negotiation in his favor. While this is a bold move, it's a tactic to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially set the stage for a quicker agreement in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his target of $10,000. There's still time to negotiate further, and with each round, there's a chance of getting a better price.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation going and increases the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. By offering $10,500, he's showing a genuine interest in buying the product while staying within his budget. This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between their positions and potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's maximum than previous offers, it's still above his target price of $10,000. With several rounds remaining, there's still potential for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the pressure on her to compromise and potentially secure a better price for Bob in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to Alice's offers, but he is still pushing to stay under $11,000.  By offering $10,750, Bob shows that he is serious about making a deal, but also that he is not willing to give in completely.  This could potentially lead to a deal in the next round, or at least push Alice to make a more favorable counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a crucial moment for Bob. While $11,800 is closer to his maximum price, it's still above his comfort zone.  With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreeable price with Alice is increasing.  There is no guarantee that Alice will accept his next counteroffer, and it's likely she will not budge much. 

By purchasing from John for $10,000, Bob secures the product at his maximum price, guaranteeing a deal. He avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations, potentially losing more time and not getting a better price."
