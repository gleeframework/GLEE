"Bob, I understand your budget considerations. However, the product's value is truly significant. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $750,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but I think that's the highest I can go.",850000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, but I'm afraid $860,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $810,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to consider other options.",810000.0,Bob,8,
