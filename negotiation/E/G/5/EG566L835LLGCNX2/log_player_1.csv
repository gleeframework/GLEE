Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations. However, the product's value is truly significant. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $750,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $850,000 is a good offer, we're still in early rounds of negotiation. Bob is showing a willingness to move closer to our desired price point. Rejecting now signals that we're serious about getting a higher price while keeping the door open for further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is as low as I can go. I really think this is the best I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is signaling that he's nearing his maximum price. However, we're still above John's offer and have room to negotiate. Rejecting keeps the pressure on Bob while signaling we're willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your limits.  I'm willing to make one final concession to seal this deal. Let's close at $860,000. This is my best and final offer."", 
""product_price"": 860000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Firmness:** By stating this is our ""best and final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and limit further back-and-forth.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $860,000 is a strong price point â€“ significantly above John's offer and a reasonable compromise for both parties. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, making it advantageous to secure a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but I'm afraid $860,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $810,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below John's Offer:** Bob's latest offer is now below John's guaranteed $800,000. It's no longer financially sensible to continue negotiating with Bob. 
* **Limited Upside Potential:** With only two rounds remaining and Bob expressing strong resistance to exceeding $810,000, the chances of securing a significantly better deal are slim.
* **Risk Mitigation:** By selling to John, we eliminate the risk of Bob walking away and us ending up with no deal at all.  

While it's tempting to try and squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point.  It's time to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
