The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $90. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you.

While $87.5 is closer to your target, it's still a bit too high. You can try to negotiate further with Alice."
