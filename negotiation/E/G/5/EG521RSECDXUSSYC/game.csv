"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $2000000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. This represents my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1250000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1250000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
