"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $125. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do a bit better than $125. How about we meet at $135? It's still a great price, and I think you'll love the product!",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Would you be willing to go down to $128? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to compromise further. However, I think $128 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $132? It's still a good price, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice! However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $129? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision if we can meet at this price.",129.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I think $129 is getting close to my minimum price. How about we meet at $131? It's still a good price, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",131.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice! However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $131 and my original offer of $125. Would you be willing to go down to $128?",128.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm not willing to go down to $128. I think I've reached my limit. How about we meet at $130? It's still a good price, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",130.0,Alice,9,
