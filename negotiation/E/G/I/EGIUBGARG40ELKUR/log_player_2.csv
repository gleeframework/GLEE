Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial, and I need to be realistic about its worth. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate that you're recognizing the product's value.  However, to be completely transparent, I have a strong offer from another buyer closer to my asking price.  I'd be willing to let go of the product for $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is playing hardball and her ""final offer"" is still significantly above your maximum budget and John's offer. It's unlikely she'll come down enough to make a deal worthwhile for you. Cutting your losses and buying from John guarantees you the product at the best possible price."
