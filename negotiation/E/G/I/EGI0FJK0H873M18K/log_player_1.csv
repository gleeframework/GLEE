Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but you also want to incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.  
* **Time Value:** While you have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even at a slightly lower price.

This offer balances getting a good price from Bob with the security of knowing John will purchase the product if needed."
