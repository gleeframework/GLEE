Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price higher than John's offer ($100) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a good profit for you. 
* **Polite and Encouraging Tone:** The message aims to be friendly and highlight the product's value to Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
