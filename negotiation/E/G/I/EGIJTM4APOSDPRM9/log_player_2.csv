"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something you've expressed interest in, and I'm confident it will meet your needs perfectly. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value, and I'm open to discussing any concerns you may have. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up at $1,200,000, but I believe this is a great opportunity for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,250,000. It's better to go with John, who is willing to sell for Bob's maximum price."
