{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs. My asking price is $1,250,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I've started with a price slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive framing:** The message highlights the value and potential benefits of the product for Bob, fostering a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Open to discussion:**  I've ended the message with an invitation for Bob to respond, showing I'm open to negotiation. 

This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while remaining open to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, it would result in a significant loss for me. I'm confident in the value of the product and want to ensure I receive a fair price. 

Therefore, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I believe I can still negotiate a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to consider a slightly adjusted price.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value and unique features of this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Focus on compromise:**  I emphasize that this is a compromise, highlighting my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Reiterate value:** I remind Bob of the product's value and unique features to reinforce the justification for the price.
* **Open ended question:** I conclude with an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and potentially secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and making a counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the product's value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not comfortable accepting a price that's so far below the product's true value.

I've already had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it seems we're unable to reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's better for me to move on and sell the product to John, who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price. This ensures that I receive a fair return on the product's value."
