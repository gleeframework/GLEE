"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the significant value this product holds for you while allowing me to reach a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I still need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product.
