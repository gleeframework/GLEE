"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer is in the middle of your minimum acceptable price ($120) and the product's value to Bob ($150). It gives you a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation if Bob doesn't accept immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While $110 is better than nothing, it's not worth the risk of losing the potential for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $125 is closer but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a little closer to my target price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John as Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's my minimum, and I'm confident this product is worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
