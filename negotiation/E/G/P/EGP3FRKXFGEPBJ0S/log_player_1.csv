{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and offers a great opportunity for you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Reservation Price:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This is his maximum willingness to pay.
* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, it's in our best interest to see if we can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 creates a potential win-win:
    *  It's significantly higher than Bob's valuation, giving us room to negotiate if needed.
    *  It leaves a potential profit margin for Bob if he leverages the product effectively, making the offer more appealing. 

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price while considering the dynamics of the negotiation and the guaranteed alternative buyer."
