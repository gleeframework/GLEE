,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's start with this figure and see if we can find a common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,600,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still above my limit. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $1,400,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,550,000, which is still slightly above your last offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at this price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,400,000.  This price is fair to both of us, and I believe it's a good way to reach a final agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm thinking of a price of $1,480,000. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",1480000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $1,480,000 is still slightly higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to reach a final agreement at $1,450,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",1450000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $1,450,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,490,000, which is still a bit higher than your last offer. Let's see if we can meet at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1490000.0,Alice,9,
