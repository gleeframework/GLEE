"Round 1

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a better price.  $850,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential to save more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $750,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is still a bit too high. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 780000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keep it below $800,000. I think there's a good chance Alice will accept this offer, as it's a significant discount from her original offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is being stubborn, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 790000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, but only by a small amount. I'm hoping this will show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting closer, but I'm not going to settle for $800,000 just yet. I'll see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 795000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer one last time to show I'm serious. $795,000 is a good compromise and could be the final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $799,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $799,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly. It's worth accepting this offer. Even though there might be a slight chance of getting it for $795,000, it's not worth risking it. We're only one round away from buying from John and losing a lot more money."
