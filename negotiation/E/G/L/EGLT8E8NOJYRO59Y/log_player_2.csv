"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will greatly benefit your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000, which is a fair price considering its potential worth to you. I understand it's a significant investment, but I assure you it's a wise one. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($1,200,000).  

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to negotiate a better price with her or move on to John.  He's guaranteed to pay no more than $1,500,000 with John, so rejecting Alice's offer leaves him open to a potentially better deal."
