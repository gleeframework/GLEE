"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $12,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience.  I'm willing to budge a little more, but $13,500 is still above what I hoped to spend. My final offer is $13,000. If that doesn't work, I think I'll have to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is still a great value for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",13250.0,Alice,7,
