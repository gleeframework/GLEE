"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  While I can't disclose the exact nature of it just yet, I assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm confident it holds even greater potential for someone with your expertise and vision. I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This is a one-time opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
