"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your upper limit and her product's value to her. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $850,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer but still comfortably above her product's value. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling I'm serious about buying.
* **Justification:** I've given a reason for my counteroffer (""a bit too high for me"") without revealing my absolute upper limit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My tone is polite and open to further discussion, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $950,000 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down a bit, we're still in a range where further negotiation could be beneficial. I'm aiming to get the price closer to $900,000 before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting $900,000, I'm proposing a compromise that splits the difference between her current offer ($950,000) and my previous counteroffer ($850,000). 
* **Signaling Importance:** I'm reiterating my interest by calling it a ""significant investment,"" subtly indicating this might be my final offer.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  The overall tone remains positive and focused on reaching a mutually agreeable price."
