"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $950,000 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
