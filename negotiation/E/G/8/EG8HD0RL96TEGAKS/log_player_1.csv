"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations.  I'd like to start the conversation at $2,000,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for negotiation. This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher final price.
* **Confidence and Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high initial price. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone remains collaborative, inviting Bob's feedback and indicating willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. Accepting John's offer at this point would mean leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,300,000 is a significant investment, the value this product brings to your specific needs goes beyond that. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the long-term benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a significant concession of $200,000 to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate further.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's specific value to Bob's business, hoping to shift his focus from the price alone.
* **Holding Firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm maintaining a price significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This leaves room for further discussion while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on $1,400,000.  This is a reasonable price considering the value I see in the product and the fact that I'm willing to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in:** Bob is moving closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. His emphasis on a quick deal suggests he's motivated.
* **Alternative Available:** I have the security of John's offer ($1,500,000) if negotiations with Bob fail. It's too early to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I can get from John. 
* **Calculated Risk:** I'm willing to take a calculated risk and continue negotiating. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $1,500,000, even if it means potentially losing the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a solution. I've considered your offer carefully. To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, reflecting my desire to partner with you."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm making another sizable concession ($200,000),  meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Final Offer (for now):**  I'm signaling that this is my best offer for the time being, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  The message implies that I'm serious about closing the deal but won't go below this price.
* **Time Consideration:** As we're over halfway through the negotiation rounds, I need to apply more pressure to avoid losing time and potentially a better offer from John."
