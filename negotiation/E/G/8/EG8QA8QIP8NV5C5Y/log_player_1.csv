I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and I believe it's a fair starting point given the product's value to me. I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my target of $1,500,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and will hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
