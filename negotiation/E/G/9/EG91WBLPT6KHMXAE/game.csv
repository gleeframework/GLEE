"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality of your product, but I'm only able to pay $120 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that price?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to make a counteroffer at $130 for the product. This still allows me to cover my costs and makes it slightly more appealing than your offer. Let me know if this works for you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $125.  Let me know if that works for you.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. In light of that, I am willing to accept $128 for the product. This price allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market.",128.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $128 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $124? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.",124.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. To accommodate you better, I propose a final offer of $126 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that allows us to reach an agreement while ensuring a reasonable profit margin for me.",126.0,Alice,7,
