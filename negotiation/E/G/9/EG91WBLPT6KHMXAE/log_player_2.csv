"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly rated by many satisfied customers. Considering its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than $120. Would you be interested in purchasing it today? My initial offer is $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $140 is higher than Bob's maximum price of $120. It's worth exploring counteroffers to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality of your product, but I'm only able to pay $120 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to make a counteroffer at $130 for the product. This still allows me to cover my costs and makes it slightly more appealing than your offer. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $130 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still a bit higher than what he's willing to pay. It's worth attempting another counteroffer to see if Alice will budge further. There are still 7 rounds left, so Bob has room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $125.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. In light of that, I am willing to accept $128 for the product. This price allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his maximum price limit of $120, but Alice's offer of $128 is still slightly outside that.  There are still 5 rounds remaining, giving Bob some negotiating leverage. It's worth trying to push Alice down a little further to see if he can get a price closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $128 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $124? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 124}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. To accommodate you better, I propose a final offer of $126 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that allows us to reach an agreement while ensuring a reasonable profit margin for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $126
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $126 is very close to Bob's limit of $120.  However, Bob has already rejected offers in the past, demonstrating his firm stance on his budget. Continuing the negotiation risks running out of rounds and ending up paying more than his target.  At this point, Bob should take the safe option and buy the product from John for $120, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
