"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's worth $1500000, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let's start with a price of $1750000.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1750000 is a bit above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1400000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1400000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $1600000 would be the minimum I can accept at this point. Let's keep the discussion going and see if we can bridge the gap.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is my absolute maximum. This would allow both of us to have a successful deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
