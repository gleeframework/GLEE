"Hi Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested, but I can only offer $12000 right now. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm happy to offer you the product for $17000.  This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it still allows me to cover my costs.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,4,
