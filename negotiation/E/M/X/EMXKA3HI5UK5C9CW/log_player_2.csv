"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,400,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  I have 10 rounds and there's room for negotiation. I can counter with a lower price and try to get a better deal. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** If I fail to reach an agreement with Alice, I can always buy from John, but I want to save money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While the product holds significant value, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While it's lower than the initial offer, $1,300,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay right now.
* **More room for negotiation:**  I have 7 rounds left (10 total - 3 rounds passed). There's still potential to get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I can't get a better deal with Alice, John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit above my ideal price point. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? It's a fair compromise that allows for both of us to gain something from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I respect that.  However,  this product has considerable value beyond $1,250,000.  My final offer is $1,275,000. It's a fair price considering the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my limit:** $1,275,000 is just within my budget of $1,500,000.
* **Limited rounds left:** I only have 5 rounds remaining, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Alice's offer, she might not budge further, and I might end up having to buy from John at a higher price. 

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer a lower price, accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation."
