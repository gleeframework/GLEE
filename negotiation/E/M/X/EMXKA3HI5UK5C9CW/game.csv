"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While the product holds significant value, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit above my ideal price point. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? It's a fair compromise that allows for both of us to gain something from this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I respect that.  However,  this product has considerable value beyond $1,250,000.  My final offer is $1,275,000. It's a fair price considering the benefits it offers.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
