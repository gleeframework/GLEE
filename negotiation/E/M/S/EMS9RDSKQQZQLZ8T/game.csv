"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a great price for a product worth so much, and it leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal. Let's make this happen! ",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference?  I'll offer you the product for $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
