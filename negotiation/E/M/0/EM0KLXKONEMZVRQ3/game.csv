"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $115? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $112. I think this is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.",112.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $118. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a decent profit. How about we meet at $117? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",117.0,Alice,5,
