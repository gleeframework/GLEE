"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value is considerably higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $700,000 is still below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This is my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
