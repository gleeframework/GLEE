Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $150."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down, while still ensuring you make more than your guaranteed $100.
* **Value Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and your willingness to offer a deal before wider availability, which could make Bob more amenable to a higher price. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $150. This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for a higher price while acknowledging you have a fallback option with John."
