Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 because John acts as a safety net.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys from you. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer. This is your leverage.

**The Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that captures a significant portion of the potential value for Bob while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer.  

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 represents a fair deal. This gives you a chance to leverage its value while recognizing its exclusivity."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,150,000 is high, but leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""fair deal"" and ""exclusivity"" creates a sense of value. 
* **No Room for Counter:** By not explicitly inviting a counter-offer, you subtly increase the pressure to accept.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:**  There's a chance Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate slightly downward, but hold firm to a price above your minimum. 
* **Relationship Matters:** While getting the best price is key, consider your long-term relationship with Bob. A deal that's too one-sided could damage future interactions."
