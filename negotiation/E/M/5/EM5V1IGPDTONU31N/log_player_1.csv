"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired value but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get a higher price while still keeping the deal open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can offer you $9500 for the product. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $9,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I am willing to offer $9600 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still slightly below my ideal price, it's now above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I have a good chance of getting a better price in the remaining rounds, but  I'm not sure if it's worth the risk of losing the deal with Bob altogether.  Taking his offer now ensures a profit, and leaves me with the opportunity to sell to John if I don't get a better offer."
