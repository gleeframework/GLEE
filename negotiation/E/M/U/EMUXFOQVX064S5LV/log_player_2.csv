Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing the value it holds for you. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.

Bob should buy the product from John. Even though Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Buying from John ensures he gets the product at the best possible price."
