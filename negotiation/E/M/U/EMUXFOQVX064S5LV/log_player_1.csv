Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so $950,000 is a fair starting point that leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You value the product at $1,000,000, so you're still making a profit. 
* **It's a clear offer:**  The message is direct and invites a response from Bob.

**Remember:**  This is just a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate further, potentially making counteroffers or accepting a lower price if it's closer to your minimum. You also need to consider the time and effort involved in negotiating with Bob versus simply selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $950,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to buy it for $850,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum value of $1,000,000. You have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, so there's no need to rush into a deal with Bob that undervalues your product.  By rejecting his offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired value, potentially reaching a better agreement or still selling to John if Bob becomes unwilling to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing the value it holds for you. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows that you're willing to negotiate, moving closer to Bob's price while still staying above your minimum.
* **Fairness:**  You frame the price as fair for both parties, emphasizing that it's a compromise.
* **Open Communication:** You invite Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open.

By taking a step closer to Bob's offer, you're increasing the chances of a successful deal, while also ensuring you receive a price that's closer to your desired value."
