"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. Would you like to buy it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is overpriced at $100. You can get the product for $80 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and save the $20."
