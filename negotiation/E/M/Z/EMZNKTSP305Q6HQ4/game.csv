"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product! While it looks great, $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to the middle.  While $105 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find a better deal. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $98? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for this product.",98.0,Alice,5,
