"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
