"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is far above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is considerably higher than that.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move.  To be fair, I can't let this go for less than $1,300,000. This is already a significant reduction from my original ask. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
