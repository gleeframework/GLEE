"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know the value is significantly higher.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers who are willing to pay a good price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still get a better deal.  Rejecting her offer will force her to consider lowering the price to avoid losing the sale to John. You have leverage in this situation."
