Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

This price still allows for a good profit margin for both of us, and I believe it reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
