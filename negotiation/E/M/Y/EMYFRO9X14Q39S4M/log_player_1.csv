Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave some room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer of $130 is still above my ""worth"" of $150. It's a decent offer, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing him altogether. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
