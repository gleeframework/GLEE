"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for something worth so much to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the product's value to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for a back and forth without immediately pushing Bob away. 

**Important Note:**  While $18,000 is a good starting point, I'm prepared to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'll keep John's offer of $15,000 in mind as a minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. I have room to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  Selling to John at $15,000 is a safe option, but I believe I can get a better price through negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price while still keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm starting the counteroffer by bringing my price down from $18,000 to $16,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get from the product, making it easier for him to justify a higher price.
* **Finding Compromise:** I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""compromise"" to emphasize a collaborative approach.

**Important Note:** I'm keeping in mind that John is offering $15,000, so I'm trying to get as close to that as possible while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $12,000? That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Even though Bob claims a ""significant move,"" it's not enough to meet my needs.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob's continued offers demonstrate his interest in the product, suggesting there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I'm not convinced I've exhausted all possibilities with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make another counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions while keeping the negotiation open.  I'll need to be strategic and persuasive to convince Bob to come up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000.  This is a good compromise that considers both of our positions. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm showing flexibility by proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $16,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Good Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good compromise,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and urging him to consider the potential benefits of reaching an agreement. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  While I'm willing to come down, I'm not giving away too much. $14,000 is still a good price for me and provides a strong incentive for Bob to accept.

**Important Note:**  This is my last offer before considering selling to John. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a quick deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's also only a small increase from Bob's previous offer, suggesting he's not being very flexible.
* **Limited Time:**  With only four rounds remaining, time is running out to get a better price. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer of $15,000 in mind, and I'm not willing to sell for less than that unless it's absolutely necessary.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap. I'll need to be persuasive and emphasize the value of the product to get him to come closer to my desired price. If he rejects this final offer, I'll sell to John to secure a guaranteed $15,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm firm on my minimum price of $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  I'm confident this is a good investment for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer to Bob. I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $14,000.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get from the product, aiming to make him reconsider his position.
* **Urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by mentioning other potential buyers. This is a subtle pressure tactic to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Decision Time:**  I'm giving Bob a clear ultimatum to make a decision. If he rejects, I'll move on to John.

**Important Note:** I'm confident that $14,000 is a fair price, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary. It's a strategic gamble to see if I can push Bob to accept my final offer."
