"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that we're close, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,000. I'm willing to pay the full value of the product, but I'd like to save a bit of money. Can you consider this offer?",8000.0,Bob,4,
