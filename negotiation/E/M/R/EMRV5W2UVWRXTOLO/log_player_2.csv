{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.**  $900,000 is a significant discount from your maximum, but you can likely do better.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still within the range of what you're willing to pay. 
* **Focus on finding a win-win:** The message emphasizes finding a price that works for both parties, which can help maintain a positive negotiation dynamic.
* **Setting the stage for further negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter back, keeping the negotiation going."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Keep negotiating:**  You have 7 rounds left, so there's time to see if you can get a better deal. 
* **Don't rush:** Buying from John at this point would be more expensive than waiting to see if you can get a better deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get closer to $850,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us, given the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing to push for a lower price:** This counteroffer is still below your maximum but shows you're willing to compromise.

* **You have time to keep negotiating:**  With 5 rounds remaining, there's still room to try and push for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still too expensive:**  While John's offer is always an option, it's still more expensive than what you're hoping to achieve."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's split the difference and go with $950,000.  This price would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer is only $25,000 above your initial target of $950,000. This is a very reasonable price considering the product's value to you.
* **Limited time:**  You're now in round 7, and with only 3 rounds left, you're running out of time to negotiate further.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Pushing for a lower price could risk Alice walking away, leaving you with no choice but to buy from John at a significantly higher price. 

By accepting this offer, you secure a good deal while avoiding the potential of a more expensive purchase from John."
