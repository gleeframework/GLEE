Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, offering it to Bob at a slightly lower price increases the chances of a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $119 is just below my minimum acceptable price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and my confidence in it, subtly encouraging Bob to see its worth above $100. 
 
This strategy prioritizes getting the highest possible price from Bob while still keeping the guaranteed $120 sale to John as a backup."
