I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150) to give myself some room to negotiate.  I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by expressing my belief that he would find the product valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
