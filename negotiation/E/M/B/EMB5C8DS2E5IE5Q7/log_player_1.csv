Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $115. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $110, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $110 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $112?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a bit more on the sale."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $110. How about we meet in the middle at $111? That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $111 is a good compromise, especially considering that I'm limited to 10 rounds. It's also significantly more than what I could get from John."
