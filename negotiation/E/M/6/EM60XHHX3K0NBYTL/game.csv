"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15,000 is out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $14,000 for the product. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer you $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I think a price of $13,500 is more in line with what I'm looking for. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a significant step for me.  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to finalize the purchase. Otherwise, I'm going to have to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $12,500, Bob. However, I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,7,
