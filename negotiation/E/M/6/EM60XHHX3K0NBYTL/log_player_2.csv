"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I think a price of $13,500 is more in line with what I'm looking for. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.
