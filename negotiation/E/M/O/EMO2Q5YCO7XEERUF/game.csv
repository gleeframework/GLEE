"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product!  While I agree it's a great item, $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $110 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend though.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go below $115. I've already compromised a bit, and I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value. If you're willing to stretch a bit, I'm willing to sell it to you for $115.",115.0,Alice,5,
