Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go below $115. I've already compromised a bit, and I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value. If you're willing to stretch a bit, I'm willing to sell it to you for $115.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $110.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $100."
