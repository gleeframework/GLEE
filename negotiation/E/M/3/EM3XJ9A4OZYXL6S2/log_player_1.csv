Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**The Strategy**

The key is to offer a price attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This offer stands for 48 hours."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is polite, professional, and highlights the product's value to Bob. The limited-time offer creates a sense of urgency.
* **Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. 
    * It's significantly less than your guaranteed price from John.
    * It gives you room to negotiate slightly lower if needed, while still securing a good profit.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to allow room for concessions.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a more flexible approach might be beneficial. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum. You have a strong alternative with John!"
