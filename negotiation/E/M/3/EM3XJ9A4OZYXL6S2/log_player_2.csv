# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This offer stands for 48 hours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is below her perceived value, it's still higher than your maximum budget and the price John is offering. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to purchase from John at a lower price, saving you $150,000."
