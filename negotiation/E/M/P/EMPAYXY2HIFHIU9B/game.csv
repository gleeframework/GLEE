"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I believe it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to find a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's compromise at $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe we can both walk away happy with this agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,100,000? This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
