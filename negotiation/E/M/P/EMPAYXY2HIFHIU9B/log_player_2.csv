"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I believe it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  You need to negotiate to bring the price down to a level that's within your budget. 
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as an option gives you leverage in the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to find a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's compromise at $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe we can both walk away happy with this agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,150,000 is still above your target price and close to your maximum budget.
* **Negotiation continues:** There's room for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue pushing for a lower price.
* **John remains a safety net:** You can still turn to John if you can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
