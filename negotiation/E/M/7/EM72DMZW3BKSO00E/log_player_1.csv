Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation process open. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer, giving me the flexibility to walk away if the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **John as Backup:** I still have John as a backup buyer, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

I will counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $11,500 is still above Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving us a potential point of agreement.
* **Clear Message:** The message explicitly states that I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I've carefully considered your offer, and while I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, I am still unable to meet you at $11,500. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500 for the product. I hope this proposal is within the range you're comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Risk of accepting:** Accepting at this point would leave me with less profit than I could get from selling to John.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  There's still room for negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to my minimum.
* **John as safety net:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum price, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

I'll counteroffer Bob again, hoping to bridge the gap and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise from my previous counteroffer, showing flexibility. 
* **Close to Minimum:**  $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still allows some room for negotiation if Bob is truly willing to increase his offer.
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is direct and concise, outlining my final offer. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind, which gives me the ability to walk away if Bob continues to refuse."
