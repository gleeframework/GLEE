"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. My initial offer for the product is $16,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $16,000 is close to your limit, it's still higher than John's price. It makes sense to reject the initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in your product, $16,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** You need to start negotiating aggressively to try and get the best price. 
* **Realistic Offer:** $14,500 is still a decent price for Alice. It's within your budget and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Show Interest:**  You show you're interested in the product but want to ensure a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I would like to propose a price of $15,200 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:**  Alice's offer of $15,200 is just $200 less than John's price.  You're close to your goal of saving money.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to try and get a better price. It's possible Alice might be willing to go lower.
* **Avoid Buying Now:**  If you buy from Alice at this price, you'll be saving very little compared to John's offer. It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $15,200 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $15,000. That's my absolute top limit, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept that."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer is a firm stance, showing you're serious about getting the price down. It's also fair considering John's price. 
* **Highlight Value:**  Reminding Alice that $15,000 is fair, considering the product's value, can encourage her to accept.
* **Finality:**  The message emphasizes that this is your final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept."
