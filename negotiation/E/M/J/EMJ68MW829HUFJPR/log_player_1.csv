Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $120, which is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm using language that indicates I'm open to negotiation, making Bob feel like he has some power in the conversation. 
* **Knowing the value:** I'm aware that the product is worth $150 to Bob, so I'm aiming for a price that is both profitable for me and appealing to him.

**This strategy allows me to:**

* **Maximize my profit:** Hopefully, I can get closer to the $150 value.
* **Maintain a positive relationship with Bob:**  By being open to negotiation, I'm not antagonizing him.
* **Keep the option to sell to John:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can always sell to John for $80, ensuring I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** $90 is only $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, there's a chance he'll reject it, forcing me to sell to John for $80, which is less profitable. 
* **Time is a factor:** It's possible that if I reject Bob's offer, he might lose interest, or another buyer might come along, making the situation more complex. 

**By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a decent profit while minimizing the risk of losing out on the deal entirely.**"
