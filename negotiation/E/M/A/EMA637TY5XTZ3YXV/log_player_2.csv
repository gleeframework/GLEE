**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $717,500, which is very close to your counteroffer of $712,500.  You're willing to pay up to $800,000, so this deal is still a good value for you.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in minor price changes, and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal.  Accepting the offer saves you time and ensures you get the product."
