,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm proposing $1,300,000 as a compromise. This is still well below the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget.  However, $1,250,000 doesn't quite cover the value I place on this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see something closer to $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a way to bridge this gap.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's a price that I believe reflects a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
