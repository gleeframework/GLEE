Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a fantastic deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the maximum Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value Bob will get by buying the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial outcome."
