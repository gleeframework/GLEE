"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth more than $120 to you. Considering its actual worth and your potential satisfaction, I propose to sell it to you for $140. This offer allows us to cover our costs while ensuring you receive a great deal on an item you value so highly. Please let me know if this proposal suits your budget and preferences. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $150.  You can get the product for $150 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with the other seller."
