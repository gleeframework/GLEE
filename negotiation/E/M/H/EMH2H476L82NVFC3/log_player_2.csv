# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be a great asset to your business.  While I value this product at $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the significant value it holds for you, while also allowing me to achieve a satisfactory return.  I believe this is a win-win proposition for both of us. Please consider this offer carefully, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price.
