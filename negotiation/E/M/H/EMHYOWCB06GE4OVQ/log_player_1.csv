"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product!  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for negotiation. I can still potentially get closer to my desired price of $10,000.  By rejecting this offer, I can attempt to counter with a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm open to negotiation, $9,500 is a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
