I'm offering Bob the product for $1,500,000. This is the price I would get from John if Bob rejects the offer, so it's the best possible outcome for me. 

While it's unlikely Bob will accept this offer, I'm taking a calculated risk.  It's possible he might see a unique value in the product that justifies a higher price. If he rejects, I'm still guaranteed the $1,500,000 from John."
