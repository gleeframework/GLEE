"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant markup from my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy with $8,000, it's still below my initial desired profit.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good profit for me. I'm hoping Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and a decent profit.  I'm not willing to risk going through more rounds and potentially losing the deal."
