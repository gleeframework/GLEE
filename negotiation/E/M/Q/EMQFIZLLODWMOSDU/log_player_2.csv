**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,285,000 is very close to Bob's target price of $1,250,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice will become less willing to compromise, or Bob could end up paying the higher price from John.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most logical choice to secure the product at a good price."
