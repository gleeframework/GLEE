Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in your product but $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll offer $95.  This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm confident I can get a better price if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
