"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1400000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to come down from my initial asking price.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial asking price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to my minimum asking price. How about $1350000? This still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1300000? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $1300000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1325000? This would allow me to meet my minimum and still give you a good deal. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1325000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1310000, but that's as low as I can go. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
