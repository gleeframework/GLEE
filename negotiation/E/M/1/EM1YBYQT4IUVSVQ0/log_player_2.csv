Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go up to $10,200. I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm starting to think we might be getting close to a deal. Let's see if we can push through. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
