"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming closer, but $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain, Bob! I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go up to $9,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is still a good deal considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,500 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go down to $10,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell you're motivated to move this product, and I am still interested. To be fair to both of us, I could meet you at $10,200.  What do you say?",10200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go up to $10,200. I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm starting to think we might be getting close to a deal. Let's see if we can push through.",10500.0,Alice,9,
