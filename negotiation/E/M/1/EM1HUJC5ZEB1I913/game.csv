"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is the price I've been quoted by another seller. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $12,000 is already a competitive offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,000. This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,
