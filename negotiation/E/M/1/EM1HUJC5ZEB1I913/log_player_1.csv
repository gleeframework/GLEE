Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is the price I've been quoted by another seller. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
