"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is still above your initial value, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
