"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential return on investment for you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering my valuation of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,550,000? This price reflects the value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This price reflects the value we both see in the product while staying within my budget.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $1,375,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return. How about we settle at $1,460,000? This recognizes the value while moving closer to your budget.",1460000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1,460,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. This price reflects the value of the product and would allow us both to close the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
