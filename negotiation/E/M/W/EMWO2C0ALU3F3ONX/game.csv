"I'm really interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $18000?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $18000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $22000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $19000. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, so I'm counteroffering at $21000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great price for a unique product like this. What do you think?",21000.0,Alice,5,
