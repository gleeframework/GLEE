"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $82. This is a great compromise, considering the product is worth $100 to you. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $82 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise further and sell the product to you for $79. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product is worth $100 to you. What do you think?",79.0,Alice,5,
