"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefit. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is open-ended, inviting Bob to discuss and potentially counteroffer. 
* **Round 1 Strategy:** It's early in the game, so I'm willing to take a slight risk and see if Bob bites. If not, I can adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob is showing interest, his initial offer is too low. I believe there's room for negotiation.
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John would guarantee my minimum price, but I'm not yet desperate enough to take that option. I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, but still acknowledging his limitations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'd accept $13,000 for the product. This would still be a great deal for you, considering its value."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the product's worth to Bob, subtly reminding him that he's getting a good deal even at $13,000.
* **Maintain Profit:**  $13,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I'm still on track to achieve my goal.

**Strategy:**

By offering a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's initial offer, I am trying to strike a balance between securing a good price and maintaining a good relationship with Bob.  I'm hoping that this will lead to a successful negotiation in the upcoming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer to my desired price than his previous offer, it's not a deal I can accept yet.
* **Negotiation Continues:** We are making progress with each round. I believe there's still room for further negotiation with Bob, especially since he's expressed interest and willingness to negotiate.
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John is still an option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob first. With only 6 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not desperate yet.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, perhaps by meeting him halfway between our current offers.  I want to push for a price closer to $13,000 but need to be mindful of the limited time remaining."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $12,500.  Let's split the difference. How about $12,750? That's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of our last two offers, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to find common ground. 
* **Urgency (Subtle):** My message hints at urgency by mentioning getting closer to a deal, reminding Bob that time is running out.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing my offer as a ""fair compromise,"" making it more appealing to Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary. With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to start making more decisive moves to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $12,750 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the pressure to close a deal is mounting.  I need to make a decision and cannot afford to risk losing out on any potential profit.
* **Bob's Persistence:** Bob has remained steadfast in his offers, and I've already made concessions.  It's unlikely he'll budge much further.
* **Acceptable Profit:** While $12,500 is below my ideal price, it's still a significant profit for me, and it's more than what I would get by selling to John.

**Decision:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the best choice at this point.  While I would prefer a higher price, it's better to secure a deal and make a profit than risk losing out on the sale entirely."
