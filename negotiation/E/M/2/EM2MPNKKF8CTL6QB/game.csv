"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle on $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer.  To be honest, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $1,100,000 is a fair price considering the product's value to you. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
