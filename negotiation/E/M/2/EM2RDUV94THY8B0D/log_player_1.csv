Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $120. Would you be interested in making an offer?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
