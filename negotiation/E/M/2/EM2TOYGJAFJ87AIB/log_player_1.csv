"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. It will give me a good idea of Bob's interest level and potentially open up room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is a good price, I'm not yet ready to settle. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's beneficial to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to my ideal price. While I could try to get more, there's a risk he'll reject and we might end up at a lower price. I'm going to accept his offer to secure the deal and avoid potential further negotiation."
