Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Knowing its immense value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to earn at least $800,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Setting the price at $1,300,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still offering Bob a deal that's significantly below his perceived value.

**Important Note:** This is a single offer strategy. A more nuanced negotiation might involve multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers to potentially secure an even higher price."
