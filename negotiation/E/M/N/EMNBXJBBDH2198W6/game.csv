"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you considering its value to you.  Let's meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle again at $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further and offer $8,000. This is my final offer, as I know I can always purchase the product from John at that price. It's a fair deal that saves us both time and effort of further negotiation.",8000.0,Bob,6,
