# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Since I can get it from John for $12,000, I'd like to reject Alice's offer.
