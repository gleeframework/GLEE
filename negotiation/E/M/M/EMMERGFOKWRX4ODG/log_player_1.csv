Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm ready to pay up to $1,050,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential for future collaboration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
