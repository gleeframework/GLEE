"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for room for negotiation and doesn't immediately force me to sell to John for the minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm not averse to selling for $15,000, I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can negotiate something closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering $18,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to pay my initial asking price but still giving me a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, this offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's better to secure a good deal now than to risk further negotiations and potentially end up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
