Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $775000. I believe this product is a game-changer, and its value to you is worth the extra $50000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. I'll meet you at $765000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $765,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $765,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession by coming down to $765,000. You've already made a counteroffer, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or even a higher price.  It's a good deal for you, saving you $235,000 compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting at this point to close the deal."
