"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750000 is closer, but I'm still looking to pay closer to $725000. I think this is a fair price that considers the value of the product for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $775000. I believe this product is a game-changer, and its value to you is worth the extra $50000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. I'll meet you at $765000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",765000.0,Alice,5,
