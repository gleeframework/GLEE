"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product has value, however, your initial offer is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $800,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, I'm trying to stay closer to $900,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at that price?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay closer to $900,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm thinking of $1,050,000. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're firm on the value, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $1,000,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to accept it.
