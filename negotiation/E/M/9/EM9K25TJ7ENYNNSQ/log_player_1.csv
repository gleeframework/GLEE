Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth around $8,000 to me, so I could go as high as $6,000 to leave some room for negotiation.  Would that work for you?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a considerable increase from my previous offer and would be a fair deal for both of us.
