"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to start the price at $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth around $8,000 to me, so I could go as high as $6,000 to leave some room for negotiation.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,000 is far too low for me. This product is high-quality and in high demand, I could easily sell it for much more. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $14,000 is still  above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  Let me know if that's something you can consider.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product is truly worth the value I'm placing on it.  If we can agree on $12,000, I'm happy to close the deal today.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a considerable increase from my previous offer and would be a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,000 is still too low. Let's make this final push and settle at $10,500. This offer stands for this round only, as I do have other potential buyers interested.",10500.0,Alice,7,
