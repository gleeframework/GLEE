Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $450,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price range.  While he could continue negotiating,  the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John for a significantly higher price outweighs the potential savings of a few more rounds of negotiation. Accepting the offer is the most pragmatic choice at this point."
