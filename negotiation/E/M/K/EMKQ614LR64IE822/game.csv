"I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the product's true value is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my best offer and reflects the unique nature of what I'm offering.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $950,000 to make this work. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be responsible with my finances.",950000.0,Bob,4,
