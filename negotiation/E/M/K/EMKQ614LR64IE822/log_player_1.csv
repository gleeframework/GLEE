Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

Bob's offer:

You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's significantly better than what John is offering. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
