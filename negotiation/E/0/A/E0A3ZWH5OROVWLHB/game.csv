"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe my initial price is a more accurate reflection of the product's value. It's unique, and its potential benefits justify the investment. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a substantial concession, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
