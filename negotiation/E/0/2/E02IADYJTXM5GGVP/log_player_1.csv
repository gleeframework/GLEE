Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get as much as possible. 
* **Knowing Bob's Value:** I know Bob values the product at $800,000. This means he has some wiggle room to pay more. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so this serves as my ""safety net."" If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm prepared to negotiate, but I won't go below $1,000,000.  I will leverage John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I want to maximize my profit.
* **John's Offer:** I know John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so I have a solid backup option.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price. I'm prepared to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price.  
* **Still Above John's Offer:** My counteroffer is still higher than John's offer, giving me an advantage.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm strategically lowering the price by a smaller amount, hoping to encourage Bob to make a final move towards my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I want to maximize my profit.
* **John's Offer:** I know John is willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a higher price than Bob's current offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Negotiations can be time-consuming, and it's possible Bob is digging in his heels and won't budge further.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John ensures I get a guaranteed $1,000,000. This is a reliable and risk-free option. 

It's better to secure the higher price from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob, potentially ending up with a lower price or a longer, drawn-out process."
