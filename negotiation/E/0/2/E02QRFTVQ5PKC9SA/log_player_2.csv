"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'm excited to consider the offer. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll reject Alice's offer because I can get the same product from John for $100, which is more than Alice's offer of $95.
