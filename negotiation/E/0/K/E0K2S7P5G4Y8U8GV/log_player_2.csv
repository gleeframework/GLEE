"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know John is willing to sell the product for $150, it's the most logical choice to buy from John. There's no guarantee you'll get a lower price from Alice, and negotiating could take time."
