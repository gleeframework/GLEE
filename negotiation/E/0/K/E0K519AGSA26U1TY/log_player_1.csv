{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a little more than the product's value to me, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and positive to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its actual worth to me. Would you consider selling it to me for $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. While his offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given the value of the product to me, I would like to propose $12,250 as a fair price. This allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,250 is only $250 below my ideal price.  Considering the possibility that we might go back and forth for a while, it's better to take this offer now and secure the sale."
