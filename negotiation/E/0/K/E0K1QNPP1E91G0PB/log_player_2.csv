Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. That's the best I can do. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1,500,000.

Alice is unwilling to budge from $1,050,000. It's clear she's aware of John as a potential buyer.  At this point, accepting her offer would mean overpaying by $250,000.  Buying from John for $800,000 is the best financial decision."
