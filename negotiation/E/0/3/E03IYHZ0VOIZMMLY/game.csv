"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, my budget allows me to spend no more than $80 on this product. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit tight for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $120. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair compromise.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still believe we can find a solution within my budget. Would you be open to selling the product for $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer on that price point.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us both.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $100 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my own bottom line. I can offer the product to you for $115. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",115.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I respect your decision, Alice. I've been trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still committed to staying within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $105 for the product?",105.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your determination, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to be realistic about the value of the product. I can offer the product to you for $125. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",125.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts, Alice, but unfortunately, I cannot agree to $125. I will propose one last time at $110. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually acceptable solution.",110.0,Bob,10,
