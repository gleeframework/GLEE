"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $100. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you prompt her to potentially offer a lower price. If she doesn't, you can always buy from John for $120."
