"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $11,400. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",11400.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested,  $11,400 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a great value at this price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair compromise.  Let's work together to close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, I need to be fair to my own bottom line. How about $10,900?  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to be fair to yourself, and I appreciate your offer.  While $10,900 is close, I'm still just a bit over my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,800? This would make it possible for me to buy the product and ensure we both walk away happy.  Let's try to close this deal.",10800.0,Bob,6,
