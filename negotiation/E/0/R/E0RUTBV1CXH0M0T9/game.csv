"Alice, $20,000 is way out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is significantly lower.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents the product's true value, I understand your budget constraints.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000? This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $15,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering I'm a serious buyer and we can close the deal quickly.",12000.0,Bob,4,
