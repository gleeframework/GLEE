"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our exclusive product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, we are offering it at a special price of $900,000. We understand the importance of this investment for you, and we are confident that our product will exceed your expectations. Please let us know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting at $900,000,  you can potentially get it for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate further and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is appealing, but  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in your product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of your budget constraints. In light of your offer, we would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. We believe this price reflects the value of our product while remaining within your budget. We look forward to your consideration of this proposal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's still within your budget, and you're saving $150,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and ending up with the product from John for $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings."
