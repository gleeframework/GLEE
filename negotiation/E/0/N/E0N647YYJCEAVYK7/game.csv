"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and gives you a good return as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  My final offer is $1,150,000.  This price allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's make this happen.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll accept $1,200,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal. Let me know your decision.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
