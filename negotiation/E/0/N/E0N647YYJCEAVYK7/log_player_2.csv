Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and gives you a good return as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  My final offer is $1,150,000.  This price allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
