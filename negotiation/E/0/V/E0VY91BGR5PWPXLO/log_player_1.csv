"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  This gives me a strong starting point and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  I'm also aware of the time constraint, so I want to get a good offer early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price. While $1,250,000 is still a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with more negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob or, if necessary, turn to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, but it still keeps me above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful that I can secure a better price.  I have a few rounds left and I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,300,000. I'm starting to feel the pressure as the rounds are passing, so I'm making a slightly larger concession this time.  I'm hoping this is enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I still have some room to negotiate and I'm determined to get the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession, but I believe it's a fair offer considering the remaining rounds.  We're getting closer to the point where I may need to consider selling to John, so I need to make a move that will hopefully convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure.  It's getting very close to my minimum price, and I only have two rounds left.  I'm going to need to make a more significant counteroffer in the next round to try and secure a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,150,000.  This is my absolute minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept it. I'm running out of time, and I'm not sure if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough call, but I have to go with selling to John.  Bob's final offer is only $50,000 above my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can convince him to go higher in this final round. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk getting nothing at all."
