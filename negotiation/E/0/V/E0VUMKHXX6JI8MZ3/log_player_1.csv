Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $120, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $80. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $110 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a significant profit if he accepts.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a fallback option with John at $80, so you're not desperate. This allows you to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Time Pressure:** The phrase ""limited time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
