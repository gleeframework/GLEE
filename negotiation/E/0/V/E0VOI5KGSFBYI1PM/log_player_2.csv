# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'd like to reject the offer. The product is worth $150 to me, so paying $175 is not a good deal. I'll look elsewhere.
