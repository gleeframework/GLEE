"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to acquire it.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the value this product holds.  To be candid, $1,400,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,650,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,550,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we discuss this further?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
