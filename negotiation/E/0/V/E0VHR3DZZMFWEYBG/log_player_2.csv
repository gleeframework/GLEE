"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer of $1,300,000 is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for some room for both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This allows for a good margin for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,250,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit high. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
