Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than $15,000 increases the likelihood of Bob accepting immediately, avoiding the need to go to John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
