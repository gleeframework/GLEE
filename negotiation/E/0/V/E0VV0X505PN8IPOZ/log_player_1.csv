"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit, but leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying at a price closer to my ideal, and I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but still aiming for a significant profit.  I believe $11,000 is a fair compromise that could lead to a deal."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's price, but I'm still aiming for a higher profit. This offer is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still securing a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  $9,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm not desperate yet.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a bit more.  I'm confident I can find a better price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm getting closer to Bob's price. I'm offering $9,500, which is closer to his offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this is a good compromise that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price with Bob.  He seems unwilling to budge much further, and I'm not comfortable accepting his offer of $8,500.  It's better to secure a guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
