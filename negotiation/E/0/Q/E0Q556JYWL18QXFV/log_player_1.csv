"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum value, but I want to see if I can get a higher price. I'm giving Bob a chance to make a counteroffer, but I'll also be keeping an eye on John in case the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value, but I'm not satisfied with getting the minimum. I believe I can get a better price, so I will try to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter-offer with $13,500. This is a bit higher than Bob's offer, but still below my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a higher price. I still have time to negotiate with Bob, and I don't want to settle for less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter-offer with $12,500. This is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this is a price Bob will find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly low.  I've already rejected his offer that was below my minimum value, and I don't want to risk going even lower.  John's offer of $12,000 is my minimum, so I'll sell to John."
