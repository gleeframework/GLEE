"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $170. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Interested:** I'm maintaining a polite and friendly tone to encourage a positive negotiation. I'm also expressing continued interest in the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By saying ""around $100,"" I signal flexibility and willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down in price, $140 is still above our $120 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice meeting us ""halfway"" suggests there's more room for her to lower the price.
* **Alternative Option:** We always have the option to buy from John for $120 if the negotiations don't go in our favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet somewhere in the middle?  Would you consider $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm increasing my offer to $115, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price below my $120 limit.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This phrasing encourages Alice to continue negotiating and finding a price that works for both of us.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is slightly above the halfway point between her last offer ($140) and my previous offer ($100). This gives us some room to negotiate further while still potentially securing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you at $130, which is still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:** Alice is getting closer to our acceptable price, but $130 is still $10 more than we need to spend. 
* **Negotiating Power:** We still have time and the option of buying from John, giving us leverage to push for a lower price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting now would save time, but we might be able to save more money with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I can do $120, and I think that's a very fair offer.  It seems like we're close to a deal!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is our maximum price, so it's unlikely we'll go higher.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By framing this as our best offer and highlighting we're close, we encourage Alice to accept rather than risk losing the sale.
* **John Backup:** If Alice rejects this, we can always buy from John for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $125, which is just a small step away from your offer. I think this is a great compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:**  Alice is unlikely to go lower than $125, and we've already hit our maximum price.
* **No More Room to Negotiate:** We've been going back and forth, and it's unlikely we'll get a better deal from Alice at this point.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** Buying from John for $120 guarantees us the best possible price without further negotiation."
