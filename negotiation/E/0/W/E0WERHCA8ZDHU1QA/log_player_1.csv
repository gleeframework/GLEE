"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to make sure I can at least cover my costs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
I'm offering a counteroffer of $90, which is still a good deal for Bob as it's closer to his perceived value than my initial offer. I'm also highlighting the value proposition for him to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with $90, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we go with $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$85 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to make sure I get at least $120 for the product. I will continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll keep John as a backup option if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $95.  This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price, but it's still within a range that could potentially be acceptable to him. I'm also reminding him of the potential benefits of closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $95 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $92.50. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$92.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm  starting to get a little worried about closing a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm keeping John as a backup option in case we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $92.50 is closer, it's still a little below my minimum. How about we split the difference again and go with $93.75?  This would allow me to cover my costs and give you a great product at a competitive price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 93.75}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $93.75, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. This is a clear signal that I'm willing to make a compromise, but also that I'm not going to drop my price too much.  I'm highlighting the value proposition for him again to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $92. I think that's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the point where I'm getting frustrated with the negotiation with Bob. He's not willing to budge on his price, and I'm running out of rounds. I'm not willing to sell below my minimum acceptable price, and John is a sure bet for a sale at my minimum. It's time to move on and sell to John."
