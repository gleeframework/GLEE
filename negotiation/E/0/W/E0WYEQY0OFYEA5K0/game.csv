"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to settle a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. Let's meet in the middle and say $775,000?",775000.0,Alice,5,
