"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while also allowing for a fair profit for you.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a decent profit. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the willingness to compromise.  While $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a significant step from my previous offer. This price still allows you a substantial profit while reflecting the value to me.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a decent profit. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
