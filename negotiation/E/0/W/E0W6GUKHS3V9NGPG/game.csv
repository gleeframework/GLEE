"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  your starting price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to consider a price closer to $1,100,000.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move significantly from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. That said, $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Could you consider something closer to $1,300,000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  How about we settle at $1,550,000? This feels like a strong offer considering the value this product brings.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,425,000?",1425000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase and I respect that. While $1,425,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point. Let's make this final push - would you consider $1,475,000?",1475000.0,Alice,7,
