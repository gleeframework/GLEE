We're getting close, but it's still worth pushing Alice a little closer to John's price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase and I respect that. While $1,425,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point. Let's make this final push - would you consider $1,475,000?

Alice is clearly holding firm, and this offer is a reasonable compromise. It's better to accept a slightly higher price than risk losing the deal and having to pay John's full price."
