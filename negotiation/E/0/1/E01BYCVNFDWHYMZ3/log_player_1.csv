Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to get closer to $12,500, Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground and we are getting close to my walk-away point ($10,000 from John). Accepting $11,750 ensures I make a profit and don't risk losing the sale entirely by pushing too hard."
