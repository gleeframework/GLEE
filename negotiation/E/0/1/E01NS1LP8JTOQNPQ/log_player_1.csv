Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum budget for this purchase.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for.
