"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"", 
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a counteroffer lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, allowing us to gauge her flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message remains polite and expresses interest in the product, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous prices. Would you be willing to consider $97.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate. Accepting $97.50 would be a decent deal, but we might be able to get it lower. We're aiming for a price closer to $80, and it's too early to settle for a price significantly higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $90? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our last offer ($85) and her current offer ($97.50). This shows a willingness to compromise while still moving towards our target.
* **Anchoring:** By repeatedly suggesting prices in the lower range, we aim to anchor Alice's perception of the product's value closer to our desired price point. 
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward and presents a clear offer for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you at $92.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in the endgame now, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. However, $92.50 is still a bit high compared to our ideal price and her known value. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're looking for a more significant price drop before we agree. It's a calculated risk, but we're running out of rounds, and a firm stance might be what's needed."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $90 is really the highest I can go. If you're willing to make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're reiterating our previous offer and making it clear that this is our final price. This approach shows we're serious but not trying to lowball her.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning ""closing the deal today,"" we subtly introduce a time constraint, potentially motivating Alice to accept to avoid further negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  We haven't explicitly mentioned John, but Alice knows we have other options. This counteroffer keeps that alternative present without directly threatening to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $92, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer on the price, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has signaled that $92 is her absolute lowest price. Trying to push further might lead to a stalemate or her accepting a deal with someone else.
* **Added Value:** The ""extras"" she's offering might compensate for the slightly higher price than our target. Even if they aren't worth much, it shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Time Remaining:**  We only have a few rounds left, and we risk not reaching a deal at all if we continue haggling. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price."
