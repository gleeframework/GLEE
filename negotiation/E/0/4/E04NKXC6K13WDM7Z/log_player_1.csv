Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This price is above my minimum of $80 and leaves room for negotiation. It also allows for a potential compromise if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
While Bob's offer of $85 is lower than my initial offer, it is still higher than the $80 I would receive from John. Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most profitable option."
