"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the maximum he's willing to pay ($100, which is his perceived value of the product).  While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely to yield a significantly better result. Accepting John's offer guarantees you your minimum acceptable price without the risk of further negotiation."
