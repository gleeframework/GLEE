"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, as it reflects the significant value this product holds. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,150,000 price. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $1,050,000? I believe this price still reflects the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my financial limits.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a significant drop. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,100,000? This price recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel that we could find a mutually beneficial price. Would you be open to considering $1,075,000 for the product? This price maintains the product's value while bringing us closer to a deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
