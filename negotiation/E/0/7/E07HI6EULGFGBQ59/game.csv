"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
