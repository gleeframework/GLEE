Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation.  I know Bob values the product at $8,000, so I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $10,500. This is a compromise between my ideal price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to secure a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm choosing to sell to John. I believe the negotiation with Bob has reached a point where further concessions will bring me below my minimum value.  John's offer of $10,000 aligns with my goal of maximizing my profit."
