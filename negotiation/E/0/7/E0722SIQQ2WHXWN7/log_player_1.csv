"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer.
* **Anchoring:**  The initial price acts as an anchor. Even though it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it sets a reference point for the rest of the negotiation. 
* **Conveying Value:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high asking price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob accepts, you significantly exceed your minimum acceptable price.
2. **Understand Bob's position:**  His counter-offer will reveal how far apart your valuations are and how aggressively you need to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far below your minimum acceptable price. While his offer was expected, accepting it would leave a significant amount of money on the table. You know you have a guaranteed offer from John at your minimum, so there's room to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, my initial offer reflects the true value and potential of this product in the market. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,750,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility (Slightly):**  Coming down by a significant amount ($550,000) demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and might encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Still Above Target:** This counter-offer is still well above your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Justify the Price:**  Reiterating the product's value reinforces your position and justifies the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800,000. This is a fair price given the value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at his initial offer, indicating he might be less flexible. However, you still have several rounds left, and walking away with John's offer is always an option. It's worth testing Bob's resolve with another counteroffer, but you should start moving closer to your own minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you holding firm to your valuation, but we're still quite far apart. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a similar price point."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:** This counter-offer represents a substantial decrease from the previous round ($350,000), signaling a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Close to Minimum:** This price is now just slightly above your safety net with John, emphasizing that you're serious about selling but also not willing to go much lower.
* **Introducing Competition (Slightly Bluffing):** Mentioning another buyer (even though the price isn't exactly the same) creates a sense of urgency and competition for Bob. This might nudge him to compromise.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is your final offer, you're setting a clear boundary and increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Encourage a final decision from Bob:** He now needs to seriously consider whether he's willing to lose the deal entirely. 
2. **Potentially secure a price above your minimum:** While close to your backup, there's still a chance Bob might accept or counter-offer at a slightly higher price."
