"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value of this product is very high.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering I can purchase the same product from another seller for $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great price considering the value of the product and the opportunity cost of going with another seller.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. How about we settle at $13,250? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",13250.0,Alice,5,
