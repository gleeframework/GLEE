"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $155? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the compromise. However, $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit lower than my minimum, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $145? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the compromise again. However, $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Would you be willing to go down to $130?",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm willing to make one more offer. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $142. That's my final compromise. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider selling to John for $150.",142.0,Alice,7,
