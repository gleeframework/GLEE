Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it valuable."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $150 (its value to John), there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is a strong opening offer. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The knowledge that John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose out. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring I don't miss out on a guaranteed sale to John."
