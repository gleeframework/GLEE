"I understand you're close to your limit, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $1280000.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

I'm not willing to go above $1250000. I think that's the best price for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.,1250000.0,Bob,8,
