"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This is a strong opening offer. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's still higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing my potential profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a bit lower than what you're asking, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price and well below what I know the product is worth to him. While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to compromise that much. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see something closer to $1,100,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000, so I'll offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I need to hold out for a better deal. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, but $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's settle this and finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
