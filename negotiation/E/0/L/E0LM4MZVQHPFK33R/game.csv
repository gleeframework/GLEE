"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of making an offer of $9000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to the market value as possible. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10500, but I'd like to get as close to the market value as possible. Can you consider meeting me at $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that you're getting close to the market value, and I'm willing to meet you there. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
