"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your company. It's something that I've been developing for a while, and I'm confident it can make a significant impact on your operations. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a substantial price reduction from its true potential value, and I'm only offering it to you because I believe in the synergy we can achieve. I understand you might need some time to consider this, and I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
