Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, how about $850,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than nothing, I can still do better by negotiating further.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price."
