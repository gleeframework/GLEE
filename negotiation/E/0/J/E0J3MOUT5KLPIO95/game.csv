"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $7,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $7,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
