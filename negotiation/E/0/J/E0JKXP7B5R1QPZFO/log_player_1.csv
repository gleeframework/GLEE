Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but not excessively high, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay this price, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $130. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still lower than my desired selling price. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Hopefully, Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $135.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, it's getting close to my initial price point and is still a good deal for me.  Further negotiation might take more time and doesn't guarantee a higher offer, so I'm willing to close the deal at this point."
