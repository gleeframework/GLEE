"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go to $115.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll get good value out of the product.  What do you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
