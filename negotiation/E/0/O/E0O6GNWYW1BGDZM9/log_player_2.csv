It's better to try to negotiate with Alice. $900,000 is more than your maximum budget, and you have 9 more rounds to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good initial discount.  This leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds."

While $850,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my target. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a lower price."
