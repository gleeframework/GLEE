Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $95.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll love it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I want to get as close to Bob's $100 value as possible.
* **Negotiation Buffer:** Offering $95 gives me a buffer to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware of John's $80 offer, but I'm aiming higher. 
* **First Offer:**  Starting with a strong offer shows confidence and leaves room for a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:**  Bob's offer of $90 is only $5 less than my ideal price. 
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer entirely, or forcing me to accept John's lower offer.
* **Profit:**  $90 is still significantly higher than John's $80 offer, making it a worthwhile deal."
