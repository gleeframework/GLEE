"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price we both feel good about."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I want for the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price. I have room to negotiate down a bit, but I'm not willing to sell for less than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not completely satisfied. I believe I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating with Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make."", ""product_price"": 97.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $97.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $92.50 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $92.5 is getting close to my minimum, but it's still a bit too low for me. I've already made several concessions and I'm not sure I can push him any higher.  With only four rounds left, it's not worth the risk of not being able to reach a deal with Bob. 

Therefore, I'm going to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
