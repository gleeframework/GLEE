Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm interested in acquiring the product at a lower price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is still a good price considering the product's value, but it's more in line with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,200,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway at $1,700,000? This reflects my willingness to make a deal while ensuring the product's worth is recognized."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is a more realistic price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting too low. It's clear he's aiming for a price far below what we consider acceptable. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which ensures we don't lose money by continuing to haggle with Bob."
