"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I think it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. Considering its true worth and your potential satisfaction, I propose a price of $120 for you to consider. This offer allows me to recoup some of my investment while providing you with an opportunity to acquire something of significant value. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $120 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Rejecting her offer opens the door for a counter-offer, but even if there's no further negotiation, you're still saving $20 by going with John."
