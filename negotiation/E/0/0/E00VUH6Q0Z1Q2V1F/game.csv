"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on your product and the support you offer. However, my budget for this type of product is closer to $12000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest in our product. While I'd like to accommodate your budget, I must maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. Therefore, I am proposing a counteroffer of $14000 for the product. This price still allows us to cover our costs while providing some flexibility within your budget.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $14000 is still a bit higher than my target. I'm willing to go to $13000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.  Let me know if you're open to that.",13000.0,Bob,4,
