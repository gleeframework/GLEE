{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without having to immediately lower my price to his perceived value. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I can get $12,000 from John gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000 and is also lower than my initial offer of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's counteroffer is low, it shows he's still interested. I can likely negotiate a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation. I don't need to rush into accepting a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer ($10,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($7,000). This demonstrates willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $8,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages further negotiation.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* This counteroffer is a bit aggressive but leaves some room for potential negotiation.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I can still go back to John for $12,000, which provides me with a strong negotiating position."

* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's counteroffer is low, he's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. I can likely get a better price with another counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, so I have no pressure to accept Bob's offer."
