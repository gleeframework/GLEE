"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $12500. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I am still unable to meet at $12500. I would like to propose a price of $11000. This is my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,5,
