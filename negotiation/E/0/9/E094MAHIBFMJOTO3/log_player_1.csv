"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,150,000.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering it at $1,150,000 is just below Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, maximizing the chance he'll accept while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential for a ""mutually beneficial"" deal, promoting a collaborative negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly below what you could potentially get. You have ample rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John at this point would leave a lot of money on the table.  It's time to counter and see if you can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is substantial. I could consider coming down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  By decreasing your price by $50,000, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Hold Firm on Value:** The message reiterates the product's high value, justifying a price significantly above Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The offer of $1,100,000 aims for a middle ground between your initial asking price and Bob's offer, signaling you're looking for a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,062,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which indicates he's motivated to buy. We're still in the early stages of negotiation. While $1,062,500 is tempting, holding out for a bit longer could yield a significantly better outcome. Let's counter-offer again and see if we can nudge him closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value here, and I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle on $1,080,000?  That's a strong show of good faith on my end, and I believe it represents an excellent deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1080000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minor Concession:**  A decrease of $20,000 from your previous offer shows flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:**  Emphasizing the ""good faith"" element and portraying the offer as mutually beneficial reinforces a positive negotiation dynamic.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal how serious Bob is and if he's willing to move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  To be honest, I have a hard limit at $1,070,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is a significant amount above your minimum selling price and a substantial profit.
* **""Hard Limit"" Signal:**  By stating a ""hard limit,"" Bob indicates this is likely his final offer, and pushing further might make him walk away. 
* **Time Factor:**  You've already completed six rounds. While you have time for more back-and-forth, securing the deal now eliminates the risk of Bob losing interest or finding an alternative. 

This offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
