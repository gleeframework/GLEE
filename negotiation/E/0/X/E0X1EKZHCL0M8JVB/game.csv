"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think it's still worth more than $6,500. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,800. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $200.",7800.0,Alice,5,
