Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think it's still worth more than $6,500. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,800. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $7,800. Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price.  You'll only save $200, but it's better than risking paying more with Alice."
