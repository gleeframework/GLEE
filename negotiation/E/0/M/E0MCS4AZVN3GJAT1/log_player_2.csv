"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll really benefit from it. As we've discussed, this product is worth $800000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for... $750000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $750,000, which is $50,000 less than John's price.
* **It's within your budget:** The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice's offer is below that, so it's a good deal. 

While you could potentially try to negotiate with Alice further, accepting her offer guarantees you get the product at a lower price than John's."
