Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize my potential profit. Here's the reasoning:

* **My minimum:** I know John will pay $1,000,000, so that's my floor.
* **Potential upside:** By offering $1,500,000, I have a chance to earn significantly more. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential reward of an extra $500,000 outweighs the risk of only getting the $1,000,000 from John.

This strategy balances the need to secure a sale with the desire for a high profit."
