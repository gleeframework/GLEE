Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, offering it for $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, still netting you more than your minimum. 
* **Appear Reasonable:** A price closer to Bob's perceived value ($100) might make him more likely to engage, even if he doesn't accept the initial offer. 

This strategy aims to find the sweet spot between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
