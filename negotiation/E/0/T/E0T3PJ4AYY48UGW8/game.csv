"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see that you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise at $10500.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9750?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
