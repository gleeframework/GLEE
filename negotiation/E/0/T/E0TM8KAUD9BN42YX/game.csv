"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a great price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  This is a fair price that's within our budgets.  Let's close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations, I'm willing to drop to $13,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",13750.0,Alice,5,
