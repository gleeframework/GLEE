```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a great price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations, I'm willing to drop to $13,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and with only 5 rounds remaining, it's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate a price that meets his needs. It's better to buy from John and get a guaranteed good deal within his budget."
