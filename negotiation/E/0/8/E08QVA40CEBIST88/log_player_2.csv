I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her own valuation, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. By rejecting her offer, you can leverage John's price and potentially negotiate a better deal with Alice or proceed to buy from John at the lower price."
