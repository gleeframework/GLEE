"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This price reflects the product's true value and allows for some flexibility on both sides. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but it's still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial situation, and I value our continued negotiation.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and a compromise I'm making to meet you halfway.  Let's close the deal at this price, which is fair for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
