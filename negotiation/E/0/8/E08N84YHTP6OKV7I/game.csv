,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this stage. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable asset. Let's try $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm open to a final compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,325,000. This price reflects both the product's value and the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I hope we can reach a deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,315,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope you can understand my position and consider this offer.",1315000.0,Bob,6,
