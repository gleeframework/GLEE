Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price this early in the process.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this stage.

I believe this price reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal, especially since I have the option of selling to John for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm open to a final compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,315,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope you can understand my position and consider this offer.

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low. I'm confident I can get my desired price from John, so I'm going to sell the product to him for $1,500,000."
