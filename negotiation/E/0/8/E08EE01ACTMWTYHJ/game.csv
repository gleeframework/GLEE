"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $12,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done, and I believe this price is a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
