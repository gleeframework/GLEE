Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Starting at $15,000 gives room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning another buyer (""John"") creates urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  How Bob responds will determine your next move. Be prepared to potentially negotiate."
