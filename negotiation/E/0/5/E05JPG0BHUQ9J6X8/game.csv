"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still unable to meet you at $825,000. I would like to propose $775,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",775000.0,Bob,4,
