"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. To move forward, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product.
