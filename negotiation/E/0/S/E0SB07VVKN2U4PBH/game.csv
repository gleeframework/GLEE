"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need to accept.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows you to get a good deal.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $980,000 is getting closer, but I still need to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try $1,020,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget and my need to make a good return on this valuable product. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
