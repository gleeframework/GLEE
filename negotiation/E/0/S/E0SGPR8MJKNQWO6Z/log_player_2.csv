"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get it lower. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he's making a significant counteroffer. This price is likely to be rejected, but it sets a lower starting point for the negotiation and shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's goal, it's still above his ideal price. He has 7 more rounds to negotiate with Alice and can potentially get a lower price.  There's no need to rush into a decision yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to his ideal. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is now only $500 more than Bob's previous offer.  It's getting close to his ideal price point. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the opportunity."
