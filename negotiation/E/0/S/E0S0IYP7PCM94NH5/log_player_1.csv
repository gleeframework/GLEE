Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your company. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get significantly more than my minimum value. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm. It highlights the product's value for Bob and positions the price as fair.
* **Why this approach?**  This strategy aims for a quick and positive outcome.  I'm starting with a reasonable price that allows for a good profit while giving Bob a clear understanding of my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is still more than my minimum of $1,000,000, it's significantly less than the $1,250,000 I initially offered. I'm willing to negotiate further, as Bob clearly sees value in the product. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This would allow me to reach a more profitable agreement while still giving you a great deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,175,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still trying to secure a good price.
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes finding a ""middle ground"" and again highlights the potential value for Bob. This reinforces the idea of a win-win scenario. 
* **Next Steps:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to secure the deal, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1150000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and we are now within a range that is acceptable to me. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and secures a profit for me, although it is slightly less than my initial goal. I'm willing to take this profit rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John."
