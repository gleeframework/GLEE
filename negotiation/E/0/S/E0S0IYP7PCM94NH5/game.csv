"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1100000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1175000? This would allow me to reach a more profitable agreement while still giving you a great deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1150000. Can you consider that?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
