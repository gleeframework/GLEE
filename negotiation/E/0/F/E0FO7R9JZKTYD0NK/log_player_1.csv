{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know this product is worth a lot to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is close to my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. This demonstrates confidence in the product's value. 
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" for both of us, creating a sense of shared benefit.
* **Flexibility:** I leave room for Bob to make a counteroffer, making the negotiation more likely to succeed. 

**Important Note:** The negotiation process is a dance. I'll be watching Bob's reactions and adjusting my strategy accordingly. If he seems hesitant, I might lower the price slightly. If he's very interested, I might stick to my initial price or even push higher.  The goal is to find the sweet spot where I maximize my earnings while still securing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a drastic price drop, especially since I have a backup buyer (John) who's willing to pay my minimum. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does show his genuine interest in the product.  This gives me an opportunity to counteroffer and potentially find a price that works for both of us.
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  In the next round, I'll carefully consider a counteroffer that balances my need to maximize profits with the risk of losing Bob completely.  

**Important Note:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate for a sale. This helps maintain my negotiating power and encourages Bob to consider a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints, but I'm not giving in completely. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still value the product.
* **Meet in the Middle:**  I've lowered my price significantly from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is halfway between my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($750,000). This approach makes my counteroffer seem reasonable and fair.
* **Highlight the Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, emphasizing that even at $850,000, he's getting a good deal. 

**Important Note:**  I'm strategically positioning myself to either close the deal with Bob or move on to John.  The $850,000 price point is a good compromise that balances my need to earn as much as possible with the risk of losing Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose $775000 as a more reasonable price for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  $775,000 is still too low for me to accept given my other option of selling to John.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's serious about acquiring the product.  This allows me to make another counteroffer and try to close the deal closer to my target price.
* **Maintain Pressure:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate and I have alternative options. This helps me maintain my negotiating leverage.

**Important Note:**  The negotiation is getting closer, and I need to find a way to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my desired price. I'll consider a slightly higher counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement. However, if he's unwilling to budge further, I'll move on to John and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute bottom line.  This price acknowledges your budget while still ensuring I get a fair return for the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm setting my final offer, making it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower.  This creates urgency and pressure for Bob to accept. 
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reaffirming the value of the product, reminding Bob that even at $800,000, he's getting a good deal.
* **Strike a Balance:** $800,000 is a significant compromise from my initial offer and close to Bob's latest counteroffer.  It represents a fair balance for both parties. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will immediately turn to John and sell the product for $1,000,000.  This is my final attempt to negotiate with Bob and get the best possible price. I'm confident that $800,000 is a fair and reasonable offer, and I hope Bob will accept."
