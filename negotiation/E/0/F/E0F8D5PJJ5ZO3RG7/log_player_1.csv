"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a strong starting point that leaves room for negotiation, but still reflects the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While $920,000 is tempting, I believe we can still close the deal at a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 935000}

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, the negotiations with Bob are becoming increasingly difficult. The offer of $915,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not confident we can reach an agreement in the limited time remaining.  I will sell the product to John for $800,000, which is a guaranteed sale and ensures I don't lose out entirely."
