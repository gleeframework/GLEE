""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he would theoretically be willing to pay anything below that.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price around $1,200,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a good incentive to buy (a potential $300,000 gain). 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or willingness to walk away.  A more aggressive opening offer could be considered, but this carries a higher risk of Bob rejecting the deal outright."
