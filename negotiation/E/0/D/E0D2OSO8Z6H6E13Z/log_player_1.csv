"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit but also leaving room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $80, I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, giving us a chance to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is too low for me, given my minimum value of $150. I'm going to counteroffer and try to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still ensuring I make a decent profit. I think this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$110 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that doesn't at least cover my minimum value. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm going to try a middle ground again, hoping Bob is getting closer to my desired price.  If he rejects this, I might have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds, but if he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm making one final compromise by lowering my price just a bit more. I'm hopeful that Bob will see this as a good deal and accept my offer. If he rejects it, I'll go ahead and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and we're running out of rounds. I've made several compromises, but it seems we're at an impasse. It's time to secure the guaranteed $150 from John."
