Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit beyond the $800,000 guarantee from John.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting high ($925,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing its full worth to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. How Bob responds will determine the next move. If he outright rejects the offer, there might be room for a slight reduction. However, going too low too quickly could signal desperation and lower Bob's perceived value of the product."
