"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is within your budget, but it's still higher than what the product is worth to her. This means there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum value for it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to her minimum value than my maximum value.  While it's still cheaper than buying from John, it's not a great deal. I'll counteroffer again to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high for me.  I can go up to $1,150,000.  This would give you a solid profit, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum value for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle on this one. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is moving closer to her minimum value, and I'm not confident we'll reach a price that works for both of us. It's starting to get closer to the price I would pay for the product from John. It's better to cut my losses and buy from John to avoid getting stuck in a long negotiation that might not lead to a deal."
