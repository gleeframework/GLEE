"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is still a good price for you, considering your value for it, and it helps me stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high for me.  I can go up to $1,150,000.  This would give you a solid profit, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
