Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than my budget allows.  Given my research, I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, reflecting the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the increments are small and it's unlikely he'll reach a price that significantly surpasses John's $1,000,000 offer.  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him walking away or further lowballing the price.  Selling to John guarantees the $1,000,000, which is a fair price and avoids further negotiation hassle."
