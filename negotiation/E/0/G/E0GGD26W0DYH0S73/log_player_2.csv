"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value and rarity, it's worth noting that the product holds a significant significance to me, reflecting its worth of $15,000. However, considering your appreciation and potential for benefiting from this product, I am offering it to you at a special price. My proposal is to sell the product to you for $13,500. This offer allows you to secure a piece that is highly valued at $15,000 but at a more accessible price point. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's story about the product's value is interesting, it doesn't change the fact that you have a better alternative. You know John will sell you the same product for $15,000.  There's a good chance you can get Alice to lower her price further, or you can buy from John if she doesn't budge."
