Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gets a $500 discount compared to its value to him, making it a tempting deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, still allowing me to potentially earn more than $10,000.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
