"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000 and we have a $1,500,000 fallback offer, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly sought after. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""exceptional value"" and ""true worth"", we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's price at a higher point. 
* **Leaving Room:** This initial high price leaves significant space for us to come down in subsequent rounds, potentially creating a sense that Bob is getting a better deal as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for it. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly closer to his perceived value ($800,000) than our asking price. We have plenty of room to negotiate and should aim to get closer to our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  Selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value, the price you're suggesting doesn't fully reflect the product's unique capabilities and market potential.  I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,900,000 to make this work."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** We start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer to maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value, subtly suggesting Bob might be undervaluing it.
* **Significant Drop, But... :**  We make a substantial drop from $2,300,000 to $1,900,000, signaling flexibility. However, we remain significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum acceptable price.
* **Anchoring:** By proposing $1,900,000, we aim to shift the negotiation closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given your proposal careful consideration, Alice. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This price still aligns closely with my valuation of the product, while remaining within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
