``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This allows for some room to negotiate down if Bob counter-offers, but still gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $9,500 is still a little steep for me.  Could you do $8,750? That would work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While $8,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $9,125.  That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I'd be happy to meet you halfway. How about $8,937.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,937.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,937.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I've been negotiating for a while, and it seems like we're reaching an impasse.  It's not worth risking a further drop in price.  I'm going to sell to John and avoid any further negotiation with Bob."
