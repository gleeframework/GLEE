"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  While there's no guarantee Alice will accept a counteroffer, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. If Alice rejects the counteroffer, Bob can always fall back on buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is halfway between Alice's desired price of $800,000 and Alice's initial offer of $900,000. This is a fair starting point for negotiations, as it shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than her initial offer.  While it's still cheaper than buying from John, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again offering a price that is halfway between Alice's last offer of $920,000 and his previous offer of $850,000. This shows Bob is willing to compromise but is still trying to get a better price than Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to the price Bob would pay John ($1,000,000). It's now in Bob's best interest to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John. There is a risk that Alice might accept Bob's next counteroffer, but it's not worth the risk of potentially losing a deal with John."
