"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product,  $700,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to offer $650,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $675,000 is getting closer to my target price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal to John or having Alice raise the price again outweighs the potential savings of a few more rounds."
