"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is asking for $120. There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.** By rejecting, you force Alice to either lower her price or risk losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $100 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still within your budget and leaves some room for further negotiation.
* **Be polite:** Starting the message with ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer..."" shows respect and increases the chances of Alice responding positively.
* **Explain your reasoning:** Briefly mentioning why your counteroffer is reasonable (""...a bit too high for me"") can help build understanding and make your offer seem more legitimate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your budget.** $110 is lower than your initial limit of $150, and it's a reasonable compromise from her previous offer of $120.
* **There's little gain in further negotiation.** You've already managed to lower the price considerably.  Rejecting and counter-offering again might risk losing the deal or getting stuck in a protracted negotiation.
* **Buying from John is less beneficial.** At $110, you're saving $40 compared to buying from John.  

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most cost-effective option in this situation."
