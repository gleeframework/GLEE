"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum price. This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Projecting Confidence:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, conveying that I believe in its worth.
* **Leaving Room:**  Even though $18,000 is high, it's not ridiculously out of reach, leaving room for Bob to negotiate without feeling insulted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his absolute bottom line, as we know it's worth $8,000 to him. Accepting now would mean a significant loss. While selling to John is tempting, there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and we haven't even presented a counteroffer yet.  Let's aim higher before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $14,000? This reflects my willingness to be flexible while ensuring a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Drop:**  The counteroffer drops from $18,000 to $14,000. This is a substantial decrease signaling flexibility but not desperation.
* **Emphasizing ""Fairness"":**   Using terms like ""middle ground"" and ""fair deal"" appeals to a sense of compromise and mutual benefit. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still comfortably above my minimum and John's offer, leaving me room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility shown, I still believe $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I would like to stick to that figure if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his guns, but we haven't reached a point of diminishing returns yet.  He hasn't flatly refused to budge from $8,000, just ""would like to stick to that figure *if possible*"".  This implies there might be wiggle room. Let's test that before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for $8,000.  I respect that, but I also have a value in mind for this product.  To be completely frank, $12,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  It's a firm offer, but I believe it's a fair one given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring to John's Price:**  We're now at my walk-away point. By presenting it clearly, I'm anchoring the negotiation around a figure Bob knows I can achieve elsewhere.
* **Firm but Respectful:**  The language is direct (""absolute lowest"", ""firm offer"") to convey seriousness, but maintains respect for Bob's position.
* **Time Pressure:**  While not explicitly stated, this offer implicitly introduces time pressure.  Bob knows further haggling might lead me to John."
