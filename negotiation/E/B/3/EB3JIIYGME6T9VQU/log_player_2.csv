Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise again and meet you at $90. That's the lowest I can go.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $90, and you have a guaranteed option at $80.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
