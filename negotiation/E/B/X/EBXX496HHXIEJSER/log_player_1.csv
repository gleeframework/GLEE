Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  It's still a good deal for you considering your value of $8,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,750? It's a compromise, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
