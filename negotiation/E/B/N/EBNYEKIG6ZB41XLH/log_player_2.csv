You can definitely do better than $1,200,000.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."

While $1,150,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high. You can likely get a better price if you continue to negotiate."

You're very close to your target price and Alice has already made a significant concession. Accepting the offer will allow you to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
