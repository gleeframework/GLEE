Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, so I want to maximize my profit.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, so he'll only pay up to that amount.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,500,000 from John.
* **Strategy:** I'm offering a price slightly above John's offer, hoping Bob sees the value and is willing to pay a bit more to avoid losing the deal. 

This gives me a chance to get a higher price while still being within the range Bob might consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John, which is higher than Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's counteroffer shows some willingness to compromise, it's still too low. I can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer.

**Next Step:** I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 shows he's willing to pay more than his initial value of $1,000,000. 
* **My Value:** My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my minimum and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price. 

**Strategy:** I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,500,000.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John, which is higher than Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation Exhaustion:** Bob has rejected two of my counteroffers, and the negotiations seem to be getting stuck.  Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price than John's offer.

**Conclusion:** Since John's offer is a sure thing and meets my minimum value, it's the most logical choice to avoid further negotiation with Bob and secure a better price."
