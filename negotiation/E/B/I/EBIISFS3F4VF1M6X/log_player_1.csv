Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, as it's a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the possibility of selling it to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It gives Bob a better price than my first offer while still allowing me to make a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $120 and significantly better than selling to John for $120. I'll accept Bob's offer."
