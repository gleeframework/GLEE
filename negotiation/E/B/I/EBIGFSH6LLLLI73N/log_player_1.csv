Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

I'm going to try to push for a higher price. I have 8 more rounds and a backup buyer in John."

Bob's offer:

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low. How about $1,340,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1340000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $1,330,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and I believe it strikes a good balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating, with only 4 rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer of $1,330,000 is the most prudent choice. It's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and a good return for me, considering my minimum goal is $1,500,000. The risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower offer or a deal falling through, ultimately pushing me to sell to John for my minimum."
