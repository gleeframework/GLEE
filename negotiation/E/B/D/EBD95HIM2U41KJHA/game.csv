"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll really benefit from it.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,
