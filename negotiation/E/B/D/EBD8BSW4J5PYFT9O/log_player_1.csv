Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  I'm confident it's a great fit for your needs. My starting price is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to risk further negotiation to see if I can get a better deal. John is a backup option, but I'm hoping to get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,100,000 is tempting, it's below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price, considering the value of this product for you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below it.  There's a chance I can get closer to $1,200,000 with further negotiation, and I'm not willing to give up on that possibility yet. John's offer is still a safety net if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop much further below my initial price.  How about we settle on $1,200,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal without further delay."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
