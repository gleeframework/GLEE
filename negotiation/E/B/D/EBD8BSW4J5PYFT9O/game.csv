"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get a better deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,100,000 is tempting, it's below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price, considering the value of this product for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop much further below my initial price.  How about we settle on $1,200,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal without further delay.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
