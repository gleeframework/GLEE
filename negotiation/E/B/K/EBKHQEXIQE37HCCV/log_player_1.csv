"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's standing offer. While we could try to negotiate with Bob further, there's no guarantee he'll go higher. Accepting John's offer ensures we receive the product's minimum value and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation with Bob."
