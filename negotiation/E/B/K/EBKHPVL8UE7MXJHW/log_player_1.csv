Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" to reinforce the product's value to Bob.

By setting the price at $1,400,000, you have a strong chance of securing a deal with Bob while maximizing your profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you can still rely on John's offer as a safety net, ensuring you receive at least your minimum acceptable price."
