``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,800,000 is well above his maximum budget. He should try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Bob should start with a significant counteroffer, trying to get as close to his maximum budget as possible while leaving room for negotiation.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,700,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. He should continue negotiating with Alice, aiming to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Bob should offer his maximum price of $1,200,000.  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate and Alice is coming down on her price. This is a good time to see if she'll take the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still above Bob's maximum price, and while she's coming down, it's unclear if she's willing to go any lower. Since Bob has a guaranteed option with John at his maximum budget, he should take it and avoid further risk of Alice not accepting his next counteroffer."
