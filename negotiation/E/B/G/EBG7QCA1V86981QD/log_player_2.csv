It's time to cut your losses.  Alice has repeatedly used ""final offer"" language and doesn't seem willing to budge below $7,000. You've negotiated well, but you have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000. It's better to secure that price than risk Alice sticking to her guns and losing the product altogether."
