"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, we can try to secure a lower price, closer to Alice's value of $10,000.  We still have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to move the price closer to Alice's perceived value of $10,000 while still leaving room for further negotiation. By being clear about our budget constraints and offering a specific price, we demonstrate our seriousness about the purchase."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $10,500 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle for $11,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, and $11,000 is a decent compromise. It's getting close enough to our limit that continuing to negotiate might push Alice away or leave us with a worse outcome.  Accepting now secures a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at the higher price."
