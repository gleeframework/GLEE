"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth more than $10000 to you. Considering its quality and benefits, I would like to propose a price of $15000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are 9 more rounds to work with, giving Bob ample opportunity to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's features. However, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, considering it's worth $10,000 to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $12000. This still reflects the value I place on the product, while being more accessible to your budget. I hope we can reach an agreement that suits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. It's in Bob's best interest to keep negotiating to try and secure a lower price. He has 7 rounds left to make a deal, so there's still time to find a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too high. Let's split the difference and settle at $10,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}
