"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's features. However, $15000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it, considering it's worth $10000 to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $12000. This still reflects the value I place on the product, while being more accessible to your budget. I hope we can reach an agreement that suits both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit too high. Let's split the difference and settle at $10500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
