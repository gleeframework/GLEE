"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is above your maximum budget. You should reject and make a counteroffer to try and get a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,500) than Alice's initial price ($9,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Polite and Open:** My message is polite and expresses interest while clearly stating my price limit.  This sets a collaborative tone for the negotiation.

My goal is to find a price that works for both of us. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, considering the value of the product.  Let's split the difference and make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved closer to my price range, $8,500 is still above my maximum of $8,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Her willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to get closer to my target. 

I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm aiming for a compromise by suggesting a price directly in between her last offer ($8,500) and my previous one ($6,500).
* **Respectful and Solution-Oriented:** My message continues to express my willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 

Let's see if Alice finds this offer acceptable."
