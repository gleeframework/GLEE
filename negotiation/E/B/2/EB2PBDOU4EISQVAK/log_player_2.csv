"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your estimated value and well above what I'm willing to accept.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is closer to its value to me. I hope this proposal works for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000.  This would still be a substantial gain for you and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
