"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $9000 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'd be willing to pay $7000 for it.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss $8500? It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really keen on getting this product but $8000 is the absolute highest I can go right now.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8000.0,Bob,4,
