Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $800000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to come down to $700000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm genuinely interested in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
