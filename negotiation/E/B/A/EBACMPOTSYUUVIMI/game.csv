"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $800000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to come down to $700000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm genuinely interested in this product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. Let me know what you think!",750000.0,Alice,3,
