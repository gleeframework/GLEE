"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $13,000. I think it would be a valuable addition to your inventory, and this is a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  He has a higher ceiling of $15,000, so he should try to negotiate with Alice and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to go up to $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's ideal price.  At $12,000, Bob is getting a good deal and saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  It's worth accepting this offer and finalizing the purchase."
