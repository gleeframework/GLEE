"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's in both of our best interests.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to accept.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me and is still profitable for you. Let's try to reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you.",11750.0,Alice,5,
