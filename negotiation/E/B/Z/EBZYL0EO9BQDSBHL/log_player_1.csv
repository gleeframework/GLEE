Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs and the current market value. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence but I need to be realistic.  While I want to find a solution that works for us both, I can't go as low as $8,500. That's considerably below its worth. To be frank, I have another potential buyer interested at a higher price. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. If you're willing to meet me at $11,500, we have a deal. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
