"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs and the current market value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my needs. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence but I need to be realistic.  While I want to find a solution that works for us both, I can't go as low as $8,500. That's considerably below its worth. To be frank, I have another potential buyer interested at a higher price. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. If you're willing to meet me at $11,500, we have a deal. This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
