"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives Bob a reason to bargain, but also shows I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I need to make sure I get at least my minimum of $150, and ideally more. I'll counteroffer with a price that's still higher than his offer but lower than my initial one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm willing to come down a bit further to make this work."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $110 is closer, I'm still aiming for something lower. Would you be open to $75?  That feels like a fair price to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$75 is still way below my minimum of $150. I need to hold out for a better price. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating, but $75 is still too low for me.  Let's try $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
I'm slowly lowering my price, but I'm still above my minimum.  I'm hoping that by being flexible, I can encourage Bob to come up a bit more on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle right in the middle at $80? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want to get for the product.  I've already had 5 rounds of negotiation and we haven't made much progress.  It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $150."
