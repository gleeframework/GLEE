"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm willing to come down a bit further to make this work.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $110 is closer, I'm still aiming for something lower. Would you be open to $75?  That feels like a fair price to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating, but $75 is still too low for me.  Let's try $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle right in the middle at $80? That seems like a fair compromise.",80.0,Bob,6,
