Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate if he counters. However, I'm not going too high, as I don't want to scare him off completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm countering with $85. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price, given that the product is worth $80 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. I'm happy to accept this and sell the product to him. There's no point in continuing to negotiate further as I've reached my target price."
