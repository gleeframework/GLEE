Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value of the product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000.  This reflects the unique value of this product and gives us both room for a good deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,500,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price point.  You have more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get an even better price.  It's worth rejecting and making another counteroffer to see if Alice will come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a profitable transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
