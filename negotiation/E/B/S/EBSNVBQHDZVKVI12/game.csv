"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind, and $90 is the highest I'm willing to go.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $95. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $102. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",102.0,Alice,5,
