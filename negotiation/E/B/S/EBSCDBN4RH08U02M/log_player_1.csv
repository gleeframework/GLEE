{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10,000. It's a steal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

This offer starts high, giving you room to negotiate.  It also sets the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob, allowing the negotiation to begin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is at the minimum value I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal happen. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price and still a better deal than selling to John. It's time to close the deal!"
