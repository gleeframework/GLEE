"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a great deal considering its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint that I need to work within. Can we meet in the middle at $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1300000 is still significantly below what I need to get for the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1400000.  Let's meet halfway at $1450000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-value product at a reasonable price.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000, but I need to get closer to my target. Can we meet somewhere in the middle at $1320000?",1320000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to work with you here, but $1320000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1400000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This is a great product, and at this price, it's a fantastic deal for you.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1280000, which is as low as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",1280000.0,Bob,6,
