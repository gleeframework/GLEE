Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint that I need to work within. Can we meet in the middle at $1300000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,300,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to try to push for a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,300,000 is still significantly below what I need to get for the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,400,000.  Let's meet halfway at $1,450,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-value product at a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000, but I need to get closer to my target. Can we meet somewhere in the middle at $1320000?

While $1,320,000 is closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my goal with another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to work with you here, but $1,320,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This is a great product, and at this price, it's a fantastic deal for you.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1280000, which is as low as I can go. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm not confident that I can get a price I'm happy with.  Instead of risking further negotiation and possibly ending up with less, I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000.  This guarantees me the minimum price I'm looking for."
