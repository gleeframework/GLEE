"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $110. It's a great value considering its worth to us is $120, and it would be worth $100 to you. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for $100 from John, so you shouldn't accept Alice's offer of $110.  It makes sense to reject and counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're putting on the product. However, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $107.50. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Please let me know if this revised price works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $107.50 is closer to your desired price, it's still more expensive than buying from John.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer is still the best strategy."

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $107.50 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $106.25?  This way, we both get a good deal, and I can finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 106.25}
