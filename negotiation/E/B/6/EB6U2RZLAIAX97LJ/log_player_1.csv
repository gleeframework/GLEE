"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Could you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a higher price. I have several rounds left and I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $9,250? This would split the difference between our last two offers.  I'm confident you'll find this product extremely valuable."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's only $1,000 below my minimum and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. There's a risk that if I keep rejecting, Bob will walk away and I'll be forced to sell to John at a slightly lower price.  I think $9,000 is a reasonable compromise."
