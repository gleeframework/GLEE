"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Could you consider meeting me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $9,250? This would split the difference between our last two offers.  I'm confident you'll find this product extremely valuable.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,6,
