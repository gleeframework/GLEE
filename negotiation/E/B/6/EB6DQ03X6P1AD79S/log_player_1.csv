Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  Here's why:

* **Above Bob's Value:**  $14,000 is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Below My Minimum:** It's above my minimum of $15,000, but I'm willing to start lower to see if Bob is interested.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates that I'm open to negotiation, which might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.

If Bob rejects, I'll assess the situation:

* **Counteroffer:** If Bob makes a reasonable counteroffer closer to my minimum, I'll consider it.
* **John's Offer:** If Bob's counteroffers are too low or if the negotiation stalls, I'll switch to John and sell for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to go that far below my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This would still allow you to get a great deal on the product while ensuring I get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $12,250 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum and a good compromise. It's likely that further negotiation will just take more time and may not yield a better outcome.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd rather secure the sale now than risk losing Bob completely."
