"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
