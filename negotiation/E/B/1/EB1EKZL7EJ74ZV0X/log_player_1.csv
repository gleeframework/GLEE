Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see the potential value, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to counter with an offer of $1,250,000. This reflects the product's value to me while also giving you a reasonable profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
