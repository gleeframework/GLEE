"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see the potential value, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to counter with an offer of $1,250,000. This reflects the product's value to me while also giving you a reasonable profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still slightly outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it allows for a profit for you. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1,285,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a compromise we can both live with. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1285000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,285,000 is a good price, I'm still a bit tight on my budget. I'm confident we can reach a final agreement if I can bring the price down just a bit more.  Let's aim for $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,280,000. This is the minimum price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find a way to make it work.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
