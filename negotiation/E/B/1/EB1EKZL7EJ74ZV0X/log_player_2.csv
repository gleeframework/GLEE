"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. While it's a good starting point, it's important to try and negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the initial offer and counteroffering gives you the opportunity to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see the potential value, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to counter with an offer of $1,250,000. This reflects the product's value to me while also giving you a reasonable profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,300,000 is still above your desired price point. You have several rounds left, and there is still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to push for a lower price by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still slightly outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it allows for a profit for you. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1,285,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a compromise we can both live with. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,285,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get the price down to $1,275,000 or even slightly lower by making a counteroffer.  There are still several rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,285,000 is a good price, I'm still a bit tight on my budget. I'm confident we can reach a final agreement if I can bring the price down just a bit more.  Let's aim for $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,280,000. This is the minimum price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find a way to make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have only 3 rounds left, and while you can try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 

$1,280,000 is still within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price. It's a reasonable compromise considering the potential for a deal to fall through."
