"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",850000.0,Alice,3,
