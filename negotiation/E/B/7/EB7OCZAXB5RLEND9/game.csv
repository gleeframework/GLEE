"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a better price for both of us. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm willing to go a bit lower than my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can you consider $1050000? I think it's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not quite ready to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
