"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $12,000 to you. Considering its value to you, I would like to propose an initial price of $11,000. This is a special offer considering its high value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,000 is a good starting point, there is still room for negotiation. Bob should aim for a lower price, especially since he knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I'd like to make a counteroffer. Given the value this product holds for you, I am willing to consider $10,500 as the price for it. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he was aiming for $10,000, Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is a fair compromise.  He's getting a good deal and saving $1,500 compared to buying from John.  There's no guarantee he'll get a better price in the remaining rounds, and the risk of losing the deal increases with each round."
