"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $80 to you and Alice is offering it for $65, it's a good deal. There's no reason to risk getting a worse deal in the next round or spending more with John."
