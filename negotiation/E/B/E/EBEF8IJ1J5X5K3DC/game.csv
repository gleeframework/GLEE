"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a good product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $4,000?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $4,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $9,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $6,000. Would that be workable?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price down, but $6,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $8,200. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
