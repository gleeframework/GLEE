(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** $400,000 is a very good price, but there's a strong possibility Alice is willing to go lower. I'll try to negotiate a better deal before resorting to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low counteroffer, aiming to get a significant discount from Alice's initial price. I'm hoping to establish a bargaining range while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is coming down in price, but I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to push for a lower price before considering her offer or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer to $300,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, while also demonstrating that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. This is a reasonable compromise between our previous offers, and I'm hoping Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to $325,000, which is closer to my ideal price point. While there's still room for negotiation, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time. It's more likely that Alice will continue to reject my counteroffers, and I'm not willing to risk ending up with John's much higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price significantly lower than John's and keeps me within my budget."
