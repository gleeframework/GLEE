"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its true value. I'm asking for $900,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire something that can significantly benefit your operations.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,
