{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $80 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
