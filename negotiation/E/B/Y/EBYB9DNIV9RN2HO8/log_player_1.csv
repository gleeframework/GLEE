Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin than selling to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $15,000 offer isn't absurdly high, which might scare Bob away. It leaves space for him to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm secure knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 if Bob refuses. This knowledge allows me to confidently aim higher with Bob."
