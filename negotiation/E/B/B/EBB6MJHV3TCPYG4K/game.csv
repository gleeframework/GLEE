"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet halfway. How about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,800,000 is still outside of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This offer reflects the product's value to me while also leaving room for you to make a profit. ",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us.  While your offer is closer to a fair price, I need to consider the true value of the product.  Let's try $1,650,000. This keeps us moving toward a mutually beneficial deal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to maximize your profit, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's worth to me while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's make this deal happen.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
