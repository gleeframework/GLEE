"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our conversation.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but no more. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $975000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can understand that this is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
