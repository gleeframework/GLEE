"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your own asking price. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to settle for a lower price just yet. I believe I can potentially get a better deal by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This price reflects a considerable discount from your initial asking price and is a reasonable compromise. Let's aim for a quick resolution and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $1,000,000. I believe I can still push for a better price or potentially secure a deal with John. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a higher price."
