Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This leaves you some room to lower the price if necessary.
* **It's a significant discount:**  This makes the offer attractive to Bob while still leaving you with a decent profit. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you can always lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers.  However, you should always keep in mind that you can sell the product to John for $15,000 if you don't reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum price, and it's closer to his perceived value than yours. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you still have a significant margin to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below your minimum price, and although you've already lowered your price considerably, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price is too high. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is significantly higher than what Bob is offering. Selling to John is the best option at this point."
