"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $170 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $100? If that works, I'm ready to make a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll give you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll sell it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
