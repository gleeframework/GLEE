# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to meet your needs. Given its high quality and functionality, it's valued at $120 by many of our customers. Considering its worth to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that respects both the value of the product and your budget. Would you be interested in exploring this further? Let's aim for a price that ensures you're satisfied with your purchase while also allowing me to fairly compensate for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($100 < $120).**  This means you are saving money compared to buying from John.
* **You are still getting a good deal.**  Even though Alice is selling for more than her value ($100 > $80), it's still lower than what you're willing to pay ($120)."
