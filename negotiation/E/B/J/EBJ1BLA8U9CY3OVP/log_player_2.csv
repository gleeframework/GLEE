"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $17,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $17,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has the option to buy from John for $15,000.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, but there's room to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $14,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $14,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $16,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $16,000 is still more than he's willing to pay, and he can buy the product from John for $15,000. He needs to continue negotiating to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it would avoid me having to go through another seller."", ""product_price"": 15500}
