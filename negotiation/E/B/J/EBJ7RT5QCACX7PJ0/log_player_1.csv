"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This is a starting point. My reasoning is:

* **High opening offer:** It's better to start high and potentially negotiate down than to start low and have limited room to go up.
* **Reasoning:** I've included a reason for the price, framing it as a valuable opportunity.
* **Open-ended question:** This encourages Bob to engage and potentially counteroffer.

I'm aware that Bob's value for the product is unknown, so this is a calculated risk. If he rejects, I have the option to either counter or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

My reasoning:

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While I'd like to get more, Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable value.
* **Limited rounds:** We have only 10 rounds, and accepting now ensures a sale.
* **Uncertain future:** There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob, and rejecting could risk losing the deal entirely. 

Selling to Bob now is the safest and most practical option."
