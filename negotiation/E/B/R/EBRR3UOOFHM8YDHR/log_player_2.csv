"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer of $120 is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It's worth negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than our target price ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message maintains a polite tone while clearly stating our position. 
* **Strategic Goal:** This counter-offer aims to bring Alice closer to our desired price range. Even if she rejects it, we'll get a better understanding of her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved closer to our desired range, $90 is still above both our target price ($80) and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There are several rounds left, indicating potential for further price reduction.
* **Leverage:** We have the option to walk away and buy from John for $80, which gives us leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about $75? That feels like a fair price to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:**  We're gradually increasing our offer ($60 -> $75), demonstrating willingness to negotiate but also remaining firm on our budget.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  By framing $75 as a ""fair price,"" we subtly encourage Alice to perceive it as a reasonable compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer puts us within $5 of our target price and leaves room for one final push if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $85. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Quite:**  Alice is getting very close to our target price, but $85 is still above John's offer of $80.
* **Final Push:**  We have several rounds left, so we can risk one more rejection to try and secure the $80 price.
* **Leverage:** Our willingness to walk away and buy from John gives us leverage to push for the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle at $80? That's the most I can offer."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is our target price and matches John's offer.  It's firm but fair.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating it's the ""most I can offer,"" we signal this is our final offer and encourage Alice to make a decision.
* **Win-Win Framing:** We're not being aggressive, but rather trying to find a mutually agreeable solution before we need to consider other options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already given you a great deal, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $95. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Alice is unwilling to budge from $95, which is significantly higher than our target price and John's offer. 
* **No Further Negotiation:** Alice has indicated this is her final price, making further negotiation unlikely.
* **John's Offer:**  We have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80, meeting our needs without further risk or compromise."
