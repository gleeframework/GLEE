Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the Walk-Away Point:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for negotiation while staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties motivates Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize profit:** Secure the highest possible price from Bob.
2. **Ensure a Sale:**  If Bob declines, you still have the guaranteed sale to John."
