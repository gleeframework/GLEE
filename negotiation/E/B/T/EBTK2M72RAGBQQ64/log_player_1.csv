Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $130 is higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth ($80), giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $130 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving you some wiggle room if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This price allows for a back-and-forth negotiation without immediately shutting down the possibility of a deal.

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and the overall negotiation flow."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially secure a better price. I can also always sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is the absolute minimum I can accept.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  My counteroffer of $120 represents a compromise from my initial offer of $130. It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a price that's still above my minimum.
* **Reiterate my minimum:**  By stating ""the absolute minimum I can accept,"" I'm emphasizing the urgency of this price for me. 
* **Keep the door open:**  The message leaves room for further discussion and allows Bob to make another counteroffer if he wishes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, I'm now at a point where the risk of not getting a better price is too high.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John than to potentially lose out on that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
