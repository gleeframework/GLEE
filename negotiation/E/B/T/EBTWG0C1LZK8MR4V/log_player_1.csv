Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, especially considering its worth to you.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing my profit.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While I could start higher, asking for a price too close to Bob's valuation might make him feel like I'm not negotiating fairly and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 
* **Secure a Deal:**  Offering a price significantly lower than his perceived value increases the likelihood of Bob accepting, avoiding the risk of having to sell to John for $12,000."
