"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget in mind. I could go up to $90, but that's my limit.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $90 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $95? That's the highest I can go.",95.0,Bob,6,
