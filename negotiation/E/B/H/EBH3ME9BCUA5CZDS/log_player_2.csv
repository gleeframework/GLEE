"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $8,000 for the product, as that's my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8000 is your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is a lower price than the initial offer, it's still above his budget. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than previous offers, it's still above his budget of $8,000. There's a good chance Alice might come down further to secure the sale, especially since she rejected Bob's offer of $9,000.  He should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm at $9,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.  "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm at $9000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice is now firm at $10,000, which is still outside of Bob's budget. Given there are limited rounds remaining, it's better to go with John and get the product for his desired price."
