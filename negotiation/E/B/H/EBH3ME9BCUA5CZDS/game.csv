"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $8000 for the product, as that's my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8000 is your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me, but $10500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm at $9000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.  ",9000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm at $9000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
