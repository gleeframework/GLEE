Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. This leaves room for some back-and-forth, while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $150, my minimum price. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still above my minimum, to show that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit more on his end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm willing to accept it. While I'd prefer $150, $140 is a good profit and I'd rather close the deal than risk losing him entirely and having to settle with John."
