"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a really valuable item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. That's a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 was still a bit out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway at $95. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
