Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  I'm hoping he'll see value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

$1,200,000 is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not that far down. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping the price a bit, but still keeping it significantly above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  While I'd prefer a bit more, it's not worth risking losing him entirely and having to settle for John's offer."
