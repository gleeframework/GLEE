Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price of $1,200,000. This is the price John is willing to pay, so I'm not leaving any money on the table. If Bob rejects, I can always go with John."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't sell it for less than what it's worth to me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

I'm going to lower my price a bit to $1,100,000, still a decent amount above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also holding firm on my value."

Bob's offer is still too low, but I'm seeing some movement. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,050,000. This is closer to Bob's valuation, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects my minimum value. If he rejects again, I might need to consider selling to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm starting to get nervous about the limited rounds, I'm confident we can reach a better price. I'll counteroffer again, but if this round doesn't get us closer, I might have to reconsider and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7

{""product_price"": 1025000}

I'm going to lower my offer to $1,025,000. This is getting pretty close to Bob's valuation, and I'm hoping he'll accept. If not, I might have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are still too low. I've made significant concessions, but I'm not willing to go any lower. To guarantee a fair price and avoid losing more time, I'm going to sell to John."
