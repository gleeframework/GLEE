"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $8,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However,  $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $10,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. This is my best offer for now, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,5,
