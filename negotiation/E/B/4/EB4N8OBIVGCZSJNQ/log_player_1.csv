Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Secure a Sale:**  While a higher offer is tempting, it risks Bob rejecting the offer entirely. This price point ensures a significant profit while increasing the likelihood of a successful sale."
