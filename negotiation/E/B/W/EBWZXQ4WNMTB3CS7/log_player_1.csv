Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:**  This price is a significant discount from my minimum value ($1,500,000) but still offers a hefty profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **Message:** The message is polite and emphasizes the value the product offers to Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. It also leaves the door open for further discussion. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  While not reaching my ideal price, $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. 
* **Encourage negotiation:** The offer leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for a potential win-win scenario. 
* **Maintain a fallback option:**  By mentioning John, I subtly remind Bob of the alternative, adding pressure for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired value of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  It shows Bob I'm not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Explore higher offers:**  I can make a counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to compromise.
* **Secure a more profitable deal:** There's a chance I can reach a price closer to my desired range. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still my fallback option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob before resorting to that."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. While $900,000 is tempting, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000. This price still offers you significant value, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This counteroffer is a substantial decrease from my initial offer of $1,400,000, showing flexibility. It also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Message:** The message is empathetic, acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the product's value and highlighting the win-win nature of the proposed price.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, making a deal more likely. 
* **Signal commitment:**  It shows Bob that I'm seriously considering his offer, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Balance profit with closure:**  $1,200,000 is still a good price for me, but it's getting closer to the range where I might consider selling to John if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum desired value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 as a final offer. This price recognizes your budget while ensuring I can meet my own needs. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,150,000:** This counteroffer is a slight decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to compromise. It's also still significantly higher than Bob's last offer, giving him incentive to accept.
* **Message:** The message reiterates my understanding of Bob's situation while emphasizing the fairness and mutually beneficial nature of my final offer. It also creates a sense of urgency by suggesting it's the final offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Signal commitment:** This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but it also highlights that I have limits.
* **Create urgency:** By calling it a ""final offer,"" I put pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Increase the likelihood of acceptance:** This price is still attractive to Bob considering his budget and the value of the product.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move forward with selling the product to John, as this final offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1075000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's latest offer of $1,075,000 is better than his previous ones, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,500,000. Further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a price that's acceptable to me.  

I've already made substantial compromises, and I'm confident that John's offer is the best option to maximize my profit. It's time to move on and secure the deal that aligns with my financial goals."
