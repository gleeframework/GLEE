{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is closer to my goal, I believe I can still get a better price.  I want to see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,025,000 is getting closer, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to push for a better price. I still have rounds left and I'm not ready to settle for that low of an offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price closer to $1,050,000. How about we settle on $1,040,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1040000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,040,000. I'm willing to compromise again, but I can only go up to $1,015,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. We're getting close to the end of the negotiations and Bob's offers are still too low. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's significantly less than what I need.  John is a reliable buyer and I'm guaranteed to get my minimum price with him."
