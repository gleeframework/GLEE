"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at a minimum of $1500000 to me, but I believe it holds even greater potential for someone with your vision. I'm starting with an offer of $2000000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It's important to remember your goal is to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a much better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is far below the product's true value. While I'm open to negotiation, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which reflects the potential value for you while remaining fair for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

While $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above your budget. Continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still higher than I can comfortably afford.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I'm confident this deal would be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your continued interest.  $1000000 is still too low for me to accept.  However,  I'm willing to make a final concession. Let's meet in the middle at $1100000. This price acknowledges the value of the product for you while remaining fair for me. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice has made her final offer at $1,100,000, which is still above your budget.  Since you're determined to keep the product purchase under $800,000, it's best to take the guaranteed deal from John. This ensures you get the product at your desired price point."
