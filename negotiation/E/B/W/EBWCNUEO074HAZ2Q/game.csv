"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at a minimum of $1500000 to me, but I believe it holds even greater potential for someone with your vision. I'm starting with an offer of $2000000. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the potential value and provides a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is far below the product's true value. While I'm open to negotiation, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which reflects the potential value for you while remaining fair for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is closer, it's still higher than I can comfortably afford.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I'm confident this deal would be mutually beneficial.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your continued interest.  $1000000 is still too low for me to accept.  However,  I'm willing to make a final concession. Let's meet in the middle at $1100000. This price acknowledges the value of the product for you while remaining fair for me. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
