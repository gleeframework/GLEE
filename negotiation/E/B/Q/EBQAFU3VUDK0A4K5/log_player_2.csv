"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly exceptional and holds great value for those who appreciate its unique features. Given its quality and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more than its face value of $150. Considering its rarity and the effort put into creating it, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to you for $200. This is an excellent chance to own something special at a reasonable premium. I trust you'll find the value in it just as significant as I do. Let me know if you're interested in making this purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200.
