Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a higher value.  Selling to John right now is not the best option because I'm confident I can achieve a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point and we're nearing the middle ground.  With only 6 rounds left, it's a good time to accept and avoid risking a lower price or losing the deal altogether.  While selling to John guarantees my minimum, Bob's offer is only $25,000 less.  It's a risk worth taking at this stage."
