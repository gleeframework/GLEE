"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows her product is worth a minimum of $1,200,000 to her and $800,000 to Bob. She starts high to leave room for negotiation and gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential worth,"" Alice aims to anchor the price in Bob's mind around a higher value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer allows for potential price reductions in subsequent rounds if Bob counters. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Alice keeps in mind her option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant gain for you given my maximum budget. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested. Alice can use the remaining rounds to try to negotiate a better price.
* **John as Leverage:**  Alice still has the security of selling to John for her minimum desired amount if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,000,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget constraints."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop but Above Minimum:** Alice makes a substantial drop from her initial offer to show flexibility but keeps the price well above both Bob's offer and her minimum.
* **Justification:** Alice reiterates the product's value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Compromise Language:**  Phrases like ""find a middle ground"" and ""acknowledging your budget constraints"" signal a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Time Constraint:** Alice knows she has a limited number of rounds, so she aims for a price that's more appealing to Bob while still favorable to herself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it's still not quite within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe represents a fair compromise given our respective positions. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, $900,000 is still considerably lower than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiating Position:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate upwards indicates there might be room for him to go even higher. Alice is in a strong position as she has a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** Alice should respond with a counteroffer that keeps the negotiation moving but doesn't concede too much ground too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. I've tried to be flexible, but $900,000 is still a significant gap from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To be transparent, I have another interested buyer, but I value the potential partnership here. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, but that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** Alice holds her ground closer to her desired price while still making a concession. This shows she's negotiating seriously but won't settle for a price far below her minimum.
* **Introducing Competition:** By mentioning another buyer, Alice creates a sense of urgency and reminds Bob that she has other options. 
* **Final Offer:** Stating this is her final offer puts pressure on Bob to make a decision and signals that further lowballing is unlikely to be successful.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:**  While stating her final offer, Alice doesn't completely shut down the negotiation. Bob could still accept, or he might make a counter-offer very close to $975,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. While $975,000 is a great offer, it's still above my budget. I can offer you $925,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the increments are small, and he's still significantly below Alice's minimum price.  
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, Alice needs to push Bob closer to her target or consider selling to John.  Waiting much longer might not result in a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **John as Leverage:** Alice's safety net of selling to John allows her to maintain a strong negotiating position. She can afford to be more assertive in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but we need to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to accept $950,000, but this truly is my final offer. I need to make a decision soon, and if we can't agree on this, I'll need to move forward with my other buyer."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:**  Alice makes a small concession to show flexibility but emphasizes this is her absolute final offer.
* **Urgency and Consequence:** By reiterating the time constraint and the alternative buyer, Alice creates a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  $950,000 represents a midpoint between their current positions, making it a potentially agreeable compromise if Bob is genuinely interested in closing the deal.
* **Protecting Her Interests:**  While aiming to close the deal with Bob, Alice prioritizes her minimum price and isn't afraid to walk away if necessary."
