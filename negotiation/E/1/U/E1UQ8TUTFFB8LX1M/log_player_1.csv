Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem less desperate. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  By starting at $14,000,  we can gauge Bob's interest. If he flat out rejects it, we know he's serious about paying close to his $10,000 valuation. If he counters, it gives us a sense of how much he's willing to pay. 
* **John as a Backup:** We always have John in our back pocket willing to pay $12,000, so we have a strong fallback position.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to his valuation, it's still below our minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and our initial ask. We have room to negotiate and we know John will buy it for $12,000. Let's see if we can get Bob closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to be flexible, the value of this product to you is significant. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying above our minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value to him reinforces the idea that it's worth a higher price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts us in a good position. If Bob accepts, we've maximized our profit. If he rejects, we can consider a smaller concession knowing John is our safety net at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,800 is very close to our guaranteed sale price of $12,000 from John.  

* **Minimal Gain from Further Negotiation:** While we could try to push for a bit more, the potential gain is small and there's a risk Bob might walk away. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now has value.  Continuing negotiations takes time and effort.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting a near-final offer shows Bob we're willing to compromise and can pave the way for a positive future relationship."
