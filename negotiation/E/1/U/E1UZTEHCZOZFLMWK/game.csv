"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $850,000?  This price still allows for a good profit for you, and it's closer to my desired value.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
