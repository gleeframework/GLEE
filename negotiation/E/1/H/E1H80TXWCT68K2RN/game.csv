"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $8,500. Would you be willing to accept $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, that price is still a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,800.  This is a fair offer, and I think it's a good compromise for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,6,
