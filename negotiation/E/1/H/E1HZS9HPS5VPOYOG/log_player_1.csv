"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. This way, I'm maximizing my potential profit while also being open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is more than the product is worth to Bob, it is significantly less than what I would get from John.  I will counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am willing to pay $10,500 for your product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still less than what John would pay. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $10,500 is still significantly below what the product is worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $11,500. This is a final offer from my end.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand the value of your product, but I need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay $11,000 for your product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close enough to my last counteroffer of $11,500, and it's still much better than selling to John for $15,000.  I'll accept this offer and finalize the deal."
