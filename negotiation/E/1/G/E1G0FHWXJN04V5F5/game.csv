"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, considering the value of this product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,125,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,187,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the ongoing negotiations.",1187500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While your offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to compromise one more time and offer the product for $1,171,875.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  I hope we can reach an agreement in this round.",1171875.0,Alice,7,
