Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $190.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 190} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price significantly higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down while still ensuring a profitable outcome.
* **Anchoring:** By offering a high initial price, I'm trying to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he doesn't accept the initial price, it might make him perceive subsequent offers as more reasonable. 
* **Quick Sale vs. Negotiation:**  While I have John as a backup, my goal is to maximize profit.  It's possible Bob will accept a high price, netting me more than the $120 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $190 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's closer to his perceived value, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's beneficial for both of us. Accepting $100 would be a significant loss compared to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a price that works, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This tactic often feels fair to both parties, potentially making Bob more agreeable.
* **Significant Drop but Above Minimum:**  The drop from $190 to $160 is substantial, signaling flexibility on my part.  Crucially, $160 is still well above both my minimum and Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $160 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $140 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I could potentially negotiate for a bit more, the difference is relatively small. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
