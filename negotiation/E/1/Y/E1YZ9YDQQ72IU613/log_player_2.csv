Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 simply isn't enough for me. However, I'm always open to finding a solution that works for both of us. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,425,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's close this deal and move forward.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in this product.  However, $1,375,000 is still not in line with its true value. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll receive, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's price is still too high. You've tried to negotiate and it doesn't seem like Alice will budge much further.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, which is within your budget, it's the best option to avoid further negotiation."
