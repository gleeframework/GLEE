"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and a fair price considering the value it brings. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** A positive and friendly message encourages Bob to engage and potentially accept the offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the opportunity and the value the product offers, which could make Bob more willing to compromise. 

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

* Secure a good starting point for negotiation.
*  Encourage Bob to see the value and potentially accept quickly. 
*  Leave room to make concessions in later rounds if necessary. 

**Remember:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  I need to get at least $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile. 
* **I have time and leverage.** I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I have a guaranteed alternative with John.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I:

* **Maintain my position.** I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my goal.
* **Signal my resolve.** This rejection shows Bob that I'm serious about achieving a price closer to my desired value.
* **Continue the negotiation.** This gives me the opportunity to potentially reach a better price in future rounds. 

**Next Step:** I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."

Let's work together to finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high. I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to complete this transaction.
