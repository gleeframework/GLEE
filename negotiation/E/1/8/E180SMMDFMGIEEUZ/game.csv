"I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we meet at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $110 is still a bit too low for me. How about $130? I'm confident you won't find this kind of quality for a better price.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. I'm willing to pay a premium for quality, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
