Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I've already made multiple compromises and I'm running out of rounds.  I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
