"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects its value and is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum value for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value I'm placing on it, and I believe it's still a fair price for you, given its worth to you. Let's continue working together to find a solution that works for both of us.
