"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is significantly above my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,500,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still not acceptable.  I'm going to reject it and try to push him higher with another counteroffer.  There are still 6 rounds remaining, so I have time to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,300,000. This is getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me somewhere in the middle.  We're in the middle of the negotiation process now, and I'm aiming for a deal that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still a bit low. I'm going to reject it and make another counteroffer. I believe we're getting close to a deal, and I want to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm making a final push for a higher price. $1,250,000 is only $50,000 above my minimum value, but it's still a significant profit.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that this is a fair price, given how close we are to the end of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are very close to the end of the negotiation with only two rounds remaining. While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value. I don't want to risk not being able to reach a satisfactory price with Bob, so I'll take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
