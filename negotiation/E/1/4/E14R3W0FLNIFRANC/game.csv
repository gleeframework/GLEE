"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while allowing us both to make a reasonable profit.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That would be a reasonable compromise for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This offer is fair and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
