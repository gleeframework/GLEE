Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth a lot to me, but I'm not willing to pay the full $2,300,000. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I'm very interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,500,000.  It demonstrates your understanding of this product's potential. To be fair, I need to be closer to $1,900,000 for a deal to make sense on my end. Would you be willing to consider something in that range?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to meet her at $1,800,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that.

{""message"": ""I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,800,000, which is my absolute maximum. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
