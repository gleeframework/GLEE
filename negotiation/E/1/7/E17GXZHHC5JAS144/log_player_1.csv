(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round.  $95 is still below my minimum value, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I'm willing to go down to $105. This is a significant drop from my initial price, and it's still above my minimum value.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 105}

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. I'm willing to come down to $102, but that's as low as I can go.  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $99 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While I'd prefer to get a bit more from Bob, the negotiations have been going on for a while, and I don't want to risk losing out completely by rejecting Bob's offer. John offers a guaranteed sale, and it's a good deal for me given my minimum value of $100."
