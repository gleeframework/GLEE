Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $8,000, giving me a profit. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could offer a lower price to increase the chances of Bob accepting, I'm taking a calculated risk.  If Bob rejects, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Offering a slightly higher price gives me the opportunity to potentially earn more. 
* **Unknown Value to Bob:** I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob, so I'm starting with a price that leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to pay closer to my asking price. 

I'm confident this strategy balances risk and reward while maximizing my potential profit."
