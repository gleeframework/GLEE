"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $8,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good enough price for me. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round.  I also need to factor in the value of selling to John for $10,000. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, but I might need to consider it if Bob doesn't budge much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is still too far off for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell for $8,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and your own assessment. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8000}
