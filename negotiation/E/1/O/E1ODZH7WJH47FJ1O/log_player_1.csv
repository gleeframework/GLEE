{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $850,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $900,000 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing him to a lower counteroffer or having to sell to John.  It's important to secure the sale at a fair price."
