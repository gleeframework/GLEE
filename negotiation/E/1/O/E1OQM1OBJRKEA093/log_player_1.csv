Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed while maximizing potential profit.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on the product's value and potential, justifying the high price without directly revealing your bottom line.
* **Urgency:**  Creating a sense of urgency encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without prolonged negotiation. 
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in your offer can make Bob more inclined to take it seriously.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's financial limits or negotiation tactics. If you had more information, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
