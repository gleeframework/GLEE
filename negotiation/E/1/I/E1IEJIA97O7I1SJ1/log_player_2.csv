"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm open to negotiating further, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can potentially save a lot of money by doing so, and there's no risk in rejecting since you can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I agree the product has great value, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer and only $50,000 more than your counteroffer. Accepting this offer means saving $250,000 compared to buying from John. While there's always a chance you could negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or having the negotiation drag on isn't worth the potential extra savings."
