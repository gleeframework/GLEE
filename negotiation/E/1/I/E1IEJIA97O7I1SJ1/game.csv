"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm open to negotiating further, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I agree the product has great value, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $900000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. ",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
