"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth attempting to get a lower price from Alice before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to my preferred price. While I could potentially negotiate further, it's not worth risking losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at $1,000,000."
