Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This initial offer gives Bob enough incentive to make a counteroffer, which is in our favor.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives us the confidence to hold out for a price closer to our desired amount. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** We've earned a good profit!
* **If Bob rejects:** We'll carefully analyze his counteroffer and use the knowledge of John's offer to guide our next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to our desired price, $9,000 is still significantly less than what we consider the product to be worth. 
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  We know John is willing to pay $15,000, giving us strong leverage to push for a higher price.
* **Counteroffer to test the waters:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to make a counteroffer that is closer to our desired price and see if we can close the gap. 

**Next Step:**

* We will send a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to our desired price. We'll use the information from John's offer to determine the best counteroffer to maximize our potential earnings."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this deal work for me. It's still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  Our counteroffer of $11,000 shows a willingness to compromise but still keeps a significant margin above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows us to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further.  If he accepts, we've successfully increased the price. If he rejects, we can assess whether to adjust our offer or move on to John.
* **Balancing Value and Risk:**  $11,000 is a good balance between maximizing our profit and potentially losing a sale if Bob walks away. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! We've secured a favorable price. 
* **If Bob rejects:**  We'll analyze his counteroffer carefully and decide whether to:
    * **Counteroffer again:** Adjust our offer further to bridge the gap.
    * **Sell to John:**  If the negotiations seem unlikely to succeed, we'll finalize the sale with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $10500. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to our goal:**  $10,500 is significantly closer to our desired price range than Bob's initial offer.  
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether. We have a strong backup option with John.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on the process and increase the likelihood of Bob finding another option or us losing interest in the deal.

**Next Step:**

* We'll finalize the sale with Bob and move on to potentially explore other opportunities."
