# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. It's too high, and he can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I understand $12,000 was a bit high.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He's still hoping to get a lower price, and the $10,500 is still too high. He's confident he can get a better deal, and John is a viable backup if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This feels like a fair price that allows us both to come away satisfied.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $10,250 is still a little too high for Bob's budget, and he's not confident he can negotiate her down further.  John offers the product at Bob's maximum price, so it's a safe and efficient choice."
