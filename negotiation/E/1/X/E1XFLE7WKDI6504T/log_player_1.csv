Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:**  $10,000 (as stated, this is the value of the product to me)
* **John's offer:** $10,000. This is my backup option.
* **Bob's value:** $8,000. This means I can't expect to get the full $10,000 from him.
* **My offer:** $9,000. This is a compromise that allows me to get a better price than Bob's value while still leaving room for him to potentially accept. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price than John's offer.

**Outcome:**

* If Bob accepts, I earn $9,000.
* If Bob rejects, I sell to John and earn $10,000.

This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while considering both Bob's value and my backup option with John."
