"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,300,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise that considers both our positions. This price reflects the potential value of the product while leaving room for you to make a solid profit. Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to agree to $1,150,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and equitable deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm ready to close this deal but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. To finalize this, I'm offering $1,125,000. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement while staying within my financial constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you say?",1125000.0,Bob,6,
