Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit impatient, but I'm still interested in the product. How about we meet at $11,500? I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I don't think I can go any lower than that.

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low, and I don't want to risk losing too much money. It's better to sell to John for $10,000 than to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
