"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $70 at this point. ",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. $100 is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested, but $100 is a bit too high. How about $75?  It's closer to my budget and I'm hopeful we can find a solution.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $85, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product. Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget with each round.  $85 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $80, which is the price I'd pay if I bought from John. Let's see if we can agree on this.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really close to your budget, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $82.50. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",82.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. I'm still hesitant to go above $80.  That's my final offer. If you're not able to accept, I'll go ahead and purchase from John.",80.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $80, Bob. I'll meet you at that price, but I have to say, I was hoping to get a bit more for the product. Okay, deal! I'll sell it to you for $80.",80.0,Alice,9,
