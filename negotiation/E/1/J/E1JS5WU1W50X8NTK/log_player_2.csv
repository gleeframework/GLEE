"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be a great value for you as well.  Let me know if you're interested!  If not, I'll be selling it to someone else for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency and implying a potential loss if you don't buy it now. However, you have a backup option with John.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. She might be willing to negotiate closer to her value of $8,000. 
* Even if she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $10,000."
