Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. Would that be more to your liking?

Alice's offer is still too high, but you're willing to negotiate a little more. You'll try to see if you can get her closer to your ideal price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $155? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your budget of $120. It's not worth risking another counteroffer and potentially going back and forth further. You'll go ahead and buy the product from John, as it's the best deal available to you."
