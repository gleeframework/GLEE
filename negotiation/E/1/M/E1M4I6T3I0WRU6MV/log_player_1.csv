{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but I'm leaving room for negotiation. This lets Bob know that I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's better to sell to Bob for $85 than to John for $80."
