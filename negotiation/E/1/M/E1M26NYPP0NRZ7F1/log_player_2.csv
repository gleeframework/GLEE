Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, my budget for this purchase is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working within a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still slightly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While it's closer than the previous offer, Bob still has some room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $800,000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I can afford. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your transparency. However, $800000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $825000. This is my final compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While there's a chance that continued negotiation could result in a lower price, it's risky.  Since Bob has the option of buying from John for $800,000,  it's the more secure and cost-effective choice at this point."
