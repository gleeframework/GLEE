"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, my budget for this purchase is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $750000. This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working within a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $800000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I can afford. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your transparency. However, $800000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $825000. This is my final compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",825000.0,Alice,5,
