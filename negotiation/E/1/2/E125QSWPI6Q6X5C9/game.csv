"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, I'm aiming to keep my acquisition costs a bit lower. Would you be open to $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to keep acquisition costs low, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1,250,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your budget. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
