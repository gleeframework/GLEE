"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This offer reflects the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a significant compromise for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you'll understand that it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on $13,500, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value I place on the product. I hope we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,6,
