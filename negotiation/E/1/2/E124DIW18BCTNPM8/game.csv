"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $16,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both some room to work with.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $15,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't regret.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure if you're serious about selling the product, but I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",14500.0,Bob,6,
