Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting closer to that figure is advantageous.
* **Leave Negotiation Room:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Confidence:** A strong initial offer conveys the product's value. 

**Important Note:**  While aiming high is a good strategy, it's essential to be realistic.  An excessively high offer (e.g., close to $1,200,000) might make Bob feel like negotiation is pointless and lead to an immediate rejection."
