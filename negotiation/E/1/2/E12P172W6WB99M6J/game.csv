"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,075,000? It's a significant price for you, and it allows me to make a good return. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
