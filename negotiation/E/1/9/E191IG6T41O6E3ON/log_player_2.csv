"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $180?

You have three options:

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering!  That price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $50?"",
""product_price"": 50
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards towards a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $50 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still too high. We need to guide her closer to our budget."

}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice we are willing to move up, but also that we are serious about a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $80, which is the minimum I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

Alice has come down to your maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting and risking paying the same price with John. Accept the offer and get the deal!"
