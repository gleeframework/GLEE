"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($1,000,000 vs. $800,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially securing a better deal for Alice. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The initial offer allows Alice to assess Bob's eagerness and flexibility. His response will provide valuable information for future rounds.
* **Alternative Option:** Alice is aware she has a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000. This knowledge provides a safety net, allowing her to confidently negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both Alice's desired price and John's standing offer. While it's good to know Bob is willing to negotiate, accepting $750,000 at this stage would be leaving money on the table. Alice has leverage with John's offer, allowing her to confidently counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle â€“ how about $925,000?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** Alice significantly reduces her initial price but still stays well above both Bob's offer and her safety net ($800,000 from John). This signals flexibility while maintaining a strong position.
* **Middle Ground:** Suggesting they ""meet in the middle"" promotes a sense of fairness and encourages Bob to negotiate further. 
* **Time Constraint:** With limited rounds, Alice needs to guide the negotiation towards a favorable outcome quickly. This counter-offer keeps the momentum going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about $850,000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $850,000 exceeds both Bob's initial offer and John's standing offer, making it a profitable deal for Alice.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a willingness to compromise and close the deal.
* **Time Value:** Accepting now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation and the possibility of Bob reducing his offer in later rounds.  Delays could lead to missing out on this favorable price."
