"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $850,000. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my best compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to close the deal. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can do better than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
