"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",90.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. While I like the product, $90 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $82 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $78.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer who appreciates the product's value.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $81. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Plus, I'm getting a bit concerned that John might snatch it up at $80 if we don't come to an agreement soon!",81.0,Alice,5,
