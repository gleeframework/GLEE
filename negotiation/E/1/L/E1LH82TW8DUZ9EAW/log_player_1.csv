"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be very valuable for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, aiming to pique his interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter, starting the negotiation process. 

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value ($800,000) as possible, while still allowing for room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700000 for your product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. I'll try to counteroffer him to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer, but I'm not going to rush to sell to John yet. I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price from $1,000,000 to $850,000. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value. 
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a solution that benefits both of us. 

I believe this counteroffer is still above my minimum value while being closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hopeful that this will lead to a successful negotiation."
