Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valued at $1,200,000, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,600,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other buyers, creating a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Negotiation room:** The high price leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob sees enough value to accept the deal."
