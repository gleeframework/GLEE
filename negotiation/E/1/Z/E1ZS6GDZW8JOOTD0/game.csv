"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I'm confident it's something that will be of great value to your business.  My initial offer is $2,000,000.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. While I understand its worth to your business, my budget constraints mean I can't meet the $2,000,000 price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is still above my ideal price point, but given the urgency of my needs and the value I see in the product, I believe this is a reasonable compromise. I hope we can move forward with this arrangement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
