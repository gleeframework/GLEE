Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $130 for this product. It's a final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is holding firm at a price that's significantly higher than your budget. Her use of ""final offer"" suggests she's unlikely to budge much lower.  While you might be able to negotiate a slightly better price, it's not worth the risk of exceeding your $100 limit. John offers a guaranteed price within your budget."
