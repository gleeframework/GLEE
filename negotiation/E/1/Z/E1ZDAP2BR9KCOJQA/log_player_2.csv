"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above your maximum budget of $100.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have rounds to work with, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $85?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's lower than her initial offer, $90 is still outside your preferred price range. 
* **Further negotiation is possible:**  You still have rounds left to try and get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference at $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I can do $88, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great price for a fantastic product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $88 is below your maximum spending limit of $100.
* **The deal is getting close:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and the difference between her offer and your ideal price is relatively small.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject this offer, there's a chance Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further, and you might end up having to buy from John at $100."
