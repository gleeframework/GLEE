"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1050000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1150000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a good compromise that allows us to both make a fair deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1100000 is still a bit below what I need. Let's meet in the middle at $1125000. This is a fair price that allows us both to close this deal. What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
