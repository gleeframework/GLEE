"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
