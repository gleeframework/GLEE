"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's close to my minimum price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  The next step is to counteroffer Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he has a guaranteed deal with John at a lower price."
