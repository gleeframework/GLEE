"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  Let's make this happen.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $125. Would you be willing to go down to $115? I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $115 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's compromise at $120.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",120.0,Alice,5,
