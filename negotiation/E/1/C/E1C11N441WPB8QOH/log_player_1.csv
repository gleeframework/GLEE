Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth your while."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly below his maximum leaves a sliver of room if he wants to haggle.
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering significantly below $119 risks Bob rejecting the offer out of principle, even if it's a good deal for him. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the sale goes through."
