"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1500000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think it's still worth more than $1100000 to me. How about we try $1180000? That's a significant discount from my original price, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1180000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1080000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1080000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $1140000? It's a significant compromise from my original price, but I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",1140000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $1140000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1080000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll accept it.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
