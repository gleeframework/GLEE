"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While it's tempting to accept since it's below the product's value to Alice, it's still too expensive for Bob. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's budget.  At this point, it's worth continuing to negotiate and trying to push for a price closer to Bob's maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows for another round of negotiation before potentially resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  It's a fair compromise considering the value we both see in it.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value I'm getting from the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  Even though it's a significant discount from the initial price, Bob is very close to his maximum budget. Buying from John at $800,000 is the most financially beneficial option for Bob at this point.  It's likely that further negotiation with Alice would only result in small concessions, making it unlikely Bob could get the price down to his target."
