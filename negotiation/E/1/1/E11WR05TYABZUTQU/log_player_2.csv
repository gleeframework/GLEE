"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to you. While it's worth $1,000,000 to you, I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects the value I place on it.  I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This allows for a substantial profit for you and a fair return for me.  Consider this a unique opportunity to secure a valuable asset at a competitive price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
