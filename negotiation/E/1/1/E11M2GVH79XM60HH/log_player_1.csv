Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with $1,450,000 aims high but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and creates a sense of urgency by mentioning other potential buyers. 

**Important Note:** While John guarantees a minimum sale price, securing a deal with Bob quickly could be advantageous. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
