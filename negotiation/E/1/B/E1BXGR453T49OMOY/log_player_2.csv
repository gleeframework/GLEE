"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While you could reject Alice's offer in hopes of getting a lower price, there's a risk involved. If you reject her offer, you're committing to buying from John at $15,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 and guarantees you get the product."
