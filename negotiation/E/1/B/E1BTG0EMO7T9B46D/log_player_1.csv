Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,500,000.  
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have John as a backup who will pay your minimum price.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage. The optimal strategy is to aim slightly higher than Bob's valuation to see if you can capture some additional value.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a competitive price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its benefits."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Competitive Price:**  $1,350,000 is above Bob's valuation but potentially within a range he might consider if he sees significant value in the product.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and fairness of the price.
* **No Room for Negotiation (Implied):** The message doesn't explicitly invite negotiation, subtly suggesting this is a strong offer.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Perspective:** You don't know how much Bob is willing to pay *over* his valuation. He might be willing to go higher than $1,200,000. 
* **Alternative:** You could start with an even higher offer closer to your minimum price. However, this risks Bob immediately rejecting the offer without a counter-proposal.

This strategy aims to balance capturing additional value with a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
