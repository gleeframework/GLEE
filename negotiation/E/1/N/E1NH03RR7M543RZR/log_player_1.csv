Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The $20,000 offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This allows you to assess Bob's level of interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and your willingness to offer a preferential deal before a public listing, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You make a significant profit beyond your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price, potentially still exceeding $15,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You proceed to sell to John at your guaranteed price.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while keeping the guaranteed sale as a safety net."
