Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to maximize her profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, she should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while staying above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential""  might make the higher price more palatable to Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  We don't know how much Bob is willing to pay beyond $8,000.  There's a risk he'll find $12,000 too high.
* **Negotiation Skills:**  This initial offer is just the opening move.  Alice's ability to negotiate effectively will be key to securing the best possible price."
