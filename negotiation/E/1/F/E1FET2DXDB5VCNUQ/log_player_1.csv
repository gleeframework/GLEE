Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this to be a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's an opportunity to make even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $1,400,000 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets the product for $100,000 less than its value to him, and you make a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Time Sensitivity:** By implying that the offer to Bob is time-sensitive, you encourage a quicker decision, preventing delays that could lead you to accept John's offer by default."
