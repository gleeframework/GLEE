I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate, while also leaving room for a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $11,500 for this product. It's in top condition and worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product is valuable to you. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's more than what John would pay.  It's a good deal for both of us."
