Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the ""exclusive"" nature of the offer to make it more enticing.
* **Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).

By aiming high initially, you maximize your chances of a higher profit while still having a safety net in place."
