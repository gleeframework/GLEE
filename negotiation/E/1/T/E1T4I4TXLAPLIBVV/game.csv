"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the item, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to match the $1800000 price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1600000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1650000. This is my best and final offer.
