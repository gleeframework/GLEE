Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep the price closer to $7,000 if possible. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $8,500? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I've considered your offer and would like to propose $8,000 as a potential price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the item. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and avoid any further negotiation risks.  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's no guarantee that will happen, and the risk of Bob walking away or the deal falling apart is real."
