"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Is that something you'd be interested in?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to come down a bit further to $125. Is that something you'd be willing to pay?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I'm still not quite there at $125.  How about we split the difference and settle on $120?  That's my final offer.",120.0,Bob,6,
