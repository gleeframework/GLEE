"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'm not willing to sell it for less than that.  However, I want to leave some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price of $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum threshold. I hope Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $95 is a decent price, and it's better than selling to John for $100."
