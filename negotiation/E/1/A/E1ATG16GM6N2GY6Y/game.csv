"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is closer to my maximum budget and still a fair price for the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. However, I'm willing to meet you at $14,250, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you.",14250.0,Alice,7,
