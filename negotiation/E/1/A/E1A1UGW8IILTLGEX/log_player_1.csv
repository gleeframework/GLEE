Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is above my minimum of $150, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a higher price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'm happy to sell for $150, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his, and hopefully, it will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $160.  It's a little below my preferred price, but it's still a good deal and higher than what John is offering.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a sale."
