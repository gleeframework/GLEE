Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also aware of John's offer, which acts as a safety net in case Bob doesn't accept my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm offering Bob $8,500, which is halfway between his initial offer and my initial offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not quite there.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. This ensures I get my minimum value and avoids further rounds of negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
