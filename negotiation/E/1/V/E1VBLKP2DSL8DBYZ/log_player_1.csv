"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me ($120) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and asking for Bob's opinion to open the dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is exactly what the product is worth to him. It's a fair price for both of us, and I can secure a sale without further negotiation."
