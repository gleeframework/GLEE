Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $9,500 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

While I could push further, Alice seems firm and $9,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's better to accept a good deal than risk losing it and having to buy from John at full price."
