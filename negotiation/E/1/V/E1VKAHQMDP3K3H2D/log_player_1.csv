Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me is $800000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
