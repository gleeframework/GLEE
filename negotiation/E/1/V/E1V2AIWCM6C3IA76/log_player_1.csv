Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. Aiming for $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Scarcity and Urgency:**  By mentioning ""other interested buyers"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification of Value:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to Bob, the message implies a high value by using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and highlighting the product's ""potential.""

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have some leeway to go down in price while still making a significant profit over your guaranteed sale to John."
