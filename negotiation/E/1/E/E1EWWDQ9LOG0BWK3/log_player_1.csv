Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he's willing to pay up to that amount. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to earn at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($150) gives you a high chance of securing the sale while maximizing your profit.  

By starting at $130, you leave room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. Even if he manages to get a small discount, you'll still earn significantly more than selling to John for $80."
