,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I think the product is interesting, $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $100.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $110? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
