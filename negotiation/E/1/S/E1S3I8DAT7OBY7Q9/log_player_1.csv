"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to me, I'm hoping to get as close to that value as possible.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is a decent amount, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired $10,000. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. Hopefully, this will be close enough to what he's willing to pay and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to $10,000, I've gone through several rounds of negotiation and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit. $9,300 is a good deal and it's a safe bet. I don't want to risk losing this sale and having to sell to John for less than I originally wanted."
