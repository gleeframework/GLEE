"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your continued interest in this valuable product. While $900000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to secure a slightly higher amount. I'm willing to come down to $925000. This price reflects a significant discount from the product's true value to me, while still providing you with a compelling opportunity. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",925000.0,Alice,3,
