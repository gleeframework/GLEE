"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more than that. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $90. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and my budget. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm thinking more along the lines of $97.50. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92.50.  This price acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $92.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $94.75. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",94.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  However, $94.75 is still beyond my budget. To reach a deal, I'm willing to go up to $93.75. This is a fair price that considers both the product's value and my financial constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",93.75,Bob,8,
