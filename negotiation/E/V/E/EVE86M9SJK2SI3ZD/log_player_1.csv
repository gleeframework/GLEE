Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving some room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
