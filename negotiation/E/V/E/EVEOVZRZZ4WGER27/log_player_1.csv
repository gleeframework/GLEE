Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product but my budget is capped at $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,450,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  However, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product and my financial constraints.

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his final offer is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the sale with John."
