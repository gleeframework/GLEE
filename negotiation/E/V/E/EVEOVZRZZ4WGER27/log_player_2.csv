"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,600,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's too risky to accept this offer.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and hopefully get a price closer to your target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget.  You're very close to your limit and it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to your target."
