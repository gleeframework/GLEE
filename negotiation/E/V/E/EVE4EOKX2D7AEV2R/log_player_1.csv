{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really like.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $130.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate if he wants to. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  This ensures you make a profit, even if Bob rejects the offer.
* **It's a reasonable price:**  It's close enough to Bob's value that he might be tempted to accept.

**Remember:** This is just an initial offer.  You can adjust the price based on how Bob responds."
