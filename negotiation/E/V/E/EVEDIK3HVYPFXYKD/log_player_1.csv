Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a strategic balance. It's lower than what John is offering, but still higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This maximizes the chance of Bob accepting while still securing a decent price for you."
