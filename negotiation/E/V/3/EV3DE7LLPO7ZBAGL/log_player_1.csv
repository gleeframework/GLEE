{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $125?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still confident I can get more. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140?  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 140}
