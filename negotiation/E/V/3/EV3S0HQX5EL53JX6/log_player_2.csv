"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high considering her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still a decent markup from her value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is polite and expresses interest while making my position clear. This encourages continued negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer aims to get Alice closer to her minimum acceptable price while avoiding a stalemate or pushing her away completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer splits the difference between her latest offer ($120) and my previous offer ($105). This shows willingness to compromise but holds firm on seeking a lower price.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward, aiming for a quick and agreeable resolution.
* **Time Consideration:**  Each round represents time and effort. I'm moving closer to Alice's likely acceptable price, considering the alternative of buying from John for $150."
