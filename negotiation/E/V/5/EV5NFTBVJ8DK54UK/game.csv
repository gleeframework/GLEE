"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I can definitely come down a bit, but $12,500 is pretty far from what I'm looking for. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll have to go with John.",13500.0,Bob,4,
