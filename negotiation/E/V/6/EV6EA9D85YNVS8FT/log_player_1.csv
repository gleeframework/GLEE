Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  This gives you some room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **It's below your minimum:** This means you're still making a profit, even if Bob accepts right away.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher price might scare Bob off right away. 

We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, $140 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
