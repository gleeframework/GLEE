Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($100) and what I believe Bob is willing to pay ($80). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $90, I leave room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  My message highlights the value for Bob, suggesting a good deal. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects the offer, but I also have the option to sell to John for $100 if I feel the negotiation is going nowhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $85 for the product. I've found another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for $80, which is within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $90.
* **Alternative Option:**  While selling to John for $100 is tempting, I'm willing to risk a bit more to see if I can secure a better price from Bob.  If the negotiation stalls, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit. However, $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about $88? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial $90 to $88. This shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing the fairness of the $88 price.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm still open to further negotiation, but I'm setting a firmer stance than before.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still looking to keep this under $85. Would $84 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $84 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it's still below it. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We're at a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price. 
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John for $100 ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might ultimately fail. 

While I would love to get more than $100, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with less than that outweighs the potential benefits.  John's offer is a secure and guaranteed outcome."
