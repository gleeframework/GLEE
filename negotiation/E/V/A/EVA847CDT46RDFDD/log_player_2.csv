Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. You should reject the offer and counteroffer with a price closer to your limit."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. I'm willing to negotiate further, but that's my starting point."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800000 is below my target price. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, but she's showing a willingness to negotiate. You can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000? This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $1100000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we aim for $1300000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. You can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. You have a clear fallback option with John, so you can afford to be firm in your negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm  really trying to make this work, but $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,200,000. I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, $1200000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1300000, but I'll throw in a small bonus or warranty to sweeten the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering a price of $1,300,000 which is still above your ideal price point and you've already made multiple counteroffers.  While she is offering a bonus or warranty, it's not clear what the value of these are.  It's likely that the value of these incentives are less than the difference between her price and your desired price.

Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000, it's more advantageous to buy from John and save $300,000."
