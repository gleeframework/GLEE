"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is low, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, but I'm sticking to my guns. I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a significant concession on my part, and it's a price that will still leave you with a great deal.  I'm hoping we can finalize this quickly. Let's make a deal!",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $10,000 is about as high as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
