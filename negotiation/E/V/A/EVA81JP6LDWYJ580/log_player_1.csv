"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  After considering your offer, I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This reflects the product's true worth and ensures a win-win for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is claiming this is his final offer, but we still have rounds to negotiate and he has a strong incentive to buy (he values the product at $1,000,000). We are still significantly above our fallback option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your position, but $875,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting antsy (claiming a ""final offer""), so it's time to start moving towards a more agreeable price point. We're splitting the difference between his last offer and our last counter-offer, which is often seen as a fair negotiation tactic.  We're still aiming higher than his offer while leaving room for some final concessions in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best and final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we still have rounds to negotiate, Bob is clearly anchoring on his ""final offer"" stance. Accepting $850,000 ensures a significant profit over our fallback of $800,000 from John.  Continuing to push risks Bob walking away entirely, forcing us to accept the lower price from John. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it for a potentially small gain."
