"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $160, which is a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for this great product.",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140, which is still a good deal for you and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,4,,

"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $145, which is a good compromise between our last two offers. Let's see if we can finalize the sale.",145.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $145. I'm willing to go up to $142, which is just a little more than my last offer.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",142.0,Bob,6,,
