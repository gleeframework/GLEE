,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to pay $80 for the product, as that's its true value for me.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to pay $100 for the product?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $90? That would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you at $95, which is still a good deal for me.",95.0,Alice,5,
