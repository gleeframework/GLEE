"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product but  can only offer $1,000,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its market value and what I'm willing to accept.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,400,000. I believe this price offers a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
