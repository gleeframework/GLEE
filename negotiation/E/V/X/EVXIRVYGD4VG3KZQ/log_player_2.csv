Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $132 is getting closer to your desired price.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation might not get a significantly better price.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for less than John's price and saves you the time and effort of further negotiation."
