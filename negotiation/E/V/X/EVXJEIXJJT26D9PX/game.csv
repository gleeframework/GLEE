"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering our valuations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise between our valuations.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both place on this product. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $1,060,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000, which is a fair compromise between our valuations. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
