"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a great deal for a product of this quality, and I think it's fair considering your initial offer.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your initial offer.  If you're not able to reach this price, I'm afraid I'll have to accept another offer.  Let me know your final decision.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still above my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'll make a final offer of $9,500. If you're not willing to sell at this price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",9500.0,Bob,6,
