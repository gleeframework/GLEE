"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my maximum budget.  It's tempting, but I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $999,000 is a tempting price, but I'm hoping to come in a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a significant offer, and I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable going down to $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $950000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and ultimately needing to buy from John for a higher price is too high.  I'll accept her offer and secure the product."
