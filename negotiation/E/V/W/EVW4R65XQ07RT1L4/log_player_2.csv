"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.**  
* **You can purchase the same product from John for $10,000, which is still within your budget.**

Therefore, it's more advantageous to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John."
