``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's still lower than my minimum value of $15,000. This allows for room for negotiation and potential counteroffers, while also ensuring I get a decent return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $15,000. While it's tempting to take the quick sale, I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let's meet halfway, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still not able to go above $10,000 for this product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between these two prices? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $10,250 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to push him closer to $11,500. I believe I can get a better price through further rounds of counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a great product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
