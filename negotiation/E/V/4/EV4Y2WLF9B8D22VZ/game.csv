"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let's meet halfway, what do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still not able to go above $10,000 for this product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between these two prices?",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a great product. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
