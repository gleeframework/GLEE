"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point. I'd be happy to purchase it for $125. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $125 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $135.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to my original price of $130. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'll sell the product to you for $132.50.",132.5,Alice,5,
