Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point. I'd be happy to purchase it for $125. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but $135 is still above your ideal target. You can continue to negotiate and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to my original price of $130. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'll sell the product to you for $132.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $132.50 is still a bit higher than your initial goal, it's a good deal considering you are already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  Accepting this offer is a smart move to get the product at a price that's within your budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price."
