"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $95 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's try $98. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $98. I'm willing to go up to $96. Can you meet me there?",96.0,Bob,6,
