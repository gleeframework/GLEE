"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,250 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  If you're open to that, we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
