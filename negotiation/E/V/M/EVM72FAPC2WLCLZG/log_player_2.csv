"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. If you're interested, let's finalize the details. However, I have another buyer lined up at $800,000, so I need your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John at $1,200,000. There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice, especially since she mentioned another buyer at a lower price. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away, potentially prompting her to lower the price further."
