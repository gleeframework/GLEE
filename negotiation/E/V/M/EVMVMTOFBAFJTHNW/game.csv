"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own a truly valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my understanding of the product, I'm willing to offer you $800000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this item.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1100000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, and I'm open to further negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $1100000, but that's still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering both our positions. Let's try to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
