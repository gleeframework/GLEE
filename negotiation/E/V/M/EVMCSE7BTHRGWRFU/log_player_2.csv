"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe is worth far more than its price tag. Considering the immense value this product holds for you, I propose a transaction where you can purchase it for $1,200,000. This offer is designed to be mutually beneficial, ensuring that you secure a valuable asset at a price that reflects its true worth while allowing me to achieve a significant return on my investment. I look forward to discussing this further and potentially closing this deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage John's offer to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed with buying from John at a lower cost."
