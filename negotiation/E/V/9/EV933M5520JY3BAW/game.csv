"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500?  This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's a fair compromise considering the value to both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 as a final compromise.  This still gives you a great deal on the product and allows us to close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time between $9,000 and $10,000. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  $9,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for, but to show you my willingness to reach an agreement, I'm offering $9,750.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,7,
