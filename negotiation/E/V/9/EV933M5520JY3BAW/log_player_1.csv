Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500?  This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's a fair compromise considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 as a final compromise.  This still gives you a great deal on the product and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time between $9,000 and $10,000. How about $9,500?

I'm still holding out for a better price.  $9,500 is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can get Bob to budge a bit more."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  $9,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for, but to show you my willingness to reach an agreement, I'm offering $9,750.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time between $9,000 and $9,750. How about $9,375? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum and we're nearing the end of the rounds. It's better to secure the sale at $9,375 than risk losing him and having to sell to John for $8,000."
