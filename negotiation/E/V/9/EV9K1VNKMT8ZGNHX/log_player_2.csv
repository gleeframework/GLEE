{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While $1,600,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what John is offering. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

Bob is still trying to get a better price than John's offer, but is also acknowledging that Alice might not be willing to go down to his previous counteroffer.  $1,450,000 is a middle ground that shows Bob is serious about buying from Alice but isn't willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,550,000 is closer to Bob's budget and to John's offer, it's still worth trying to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better deal. He has a few rounds left and can still get the product for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

Bob is now offering the exact price that John is willing to sell the product for. This shows Alice that he's serious about getting the best possible price and that he is ready to walk away if she doesn't accept. He has a good chance of getting Alice to accept this offer, as it's her minimum price."
