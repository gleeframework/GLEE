"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity with immense potential. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1,500,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to push Alice to compromise. $800,000 is still a significant amount, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I've also included a message that suggests I'm interested in the product but need a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $800000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1200000 to facilitate this deal. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I will counteroffer again in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $950,000, which is closer to Alice's last offer and still within my acceptable range. The message emphasizes that I see value in the product and want to find a mutually agreeable price.  This hopefully incentivizes Alice to consider my offer seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your latest offer. While $950000 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1050000 for the product.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value we both see in this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to accept as it's very close to the price of John's product, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  I will try one more counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there at $1,050,000. Considering the value we both see in this, I'm willing to offer a final price of $1,000,000. This is my absolute maximum, and it allows us to close the deal without further delay. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer at my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This removes any room for further negotiation and puts the pressure on Alice to decide.  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer and that accepting it will close the deal quickly."
