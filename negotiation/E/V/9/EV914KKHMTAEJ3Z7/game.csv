"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1500000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $800000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1200000 to facilitate this deal. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your latest offer. While $950000 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1050000 for the product.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value we both see in this opportunity.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there at $1050000. Considering the value we both see in this, I'm willing to offer a final price of $1000000. This is my absolute maximum, and it allows us to close the deal without further delay. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
