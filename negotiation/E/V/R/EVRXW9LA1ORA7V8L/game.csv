"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm not sure $900000 is quite in my budget right now.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the market demand. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
