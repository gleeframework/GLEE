"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's a significant discount from John's price, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **We don't know Alice's bottom line.**  Rejecting the offer allows us to gather more information and potentially get a better price.
* **The ""one-time offer"" tactic is a common sales technique.** It's designed to pressure us into accepting.  We shouldn't be swayed by this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm not sure $900,000 is quite in my budget right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This shows we are serious about a deal, but also willing to walk away if it's not a good one.
* **Reasoned Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, making it seem less arbitrary and more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends by inviting Alice to respond, keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable.**  She's met us halfway, and we're still getting a significant discount from John's price.
* **Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal.**  We've already pushed Alice down considerably.  There's a chance she may not budge further, or that she might lose interest altogether. 
* **Time is money.**  It's worth accepting this offer and securing the product. We can always look for other deals in the future."
