{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal and worth every penny! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price of $100, knowing I have a backup option with John.  This sets the stage for negotiation and gives Bob a chance to propose a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  I'll counter Bob's offer, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I appreciate you considering the product. While I understand your budget, $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  Would you be interested in that?"", ""product_price"": 90}
