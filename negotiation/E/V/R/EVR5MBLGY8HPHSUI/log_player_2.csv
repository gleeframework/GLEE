"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than the product's value to Bob ($10,000).
* There are 9 more rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to get the best possible price, but also knows he needs to be realistic. 
* Offering $8,500 is a significant decrease from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,200 is still too high for Bob.  He wants to save as much money as possible.
* While John's offer is higher than Alice's, Bob still has 7 rounds left to negotiate with Alice. 
* There's a chance he can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is willing to increase his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's still interested in buying the product.
* $8,750 is still a significant discount from Alice's offer and closer to Bob's desired price. 
* This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate but also sets a clear limit on his maximum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is still too high for Bob.  He wants to save as much money as possible.
* John's offer is still an option, but Bob has 5 rounds left to negotiate a better price with Alice.  
* He's already made some progress in lowering the price, and there's a good chance he can get closer to his desired price with a few more counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is getting closer to Alice's price, but still wants to save as much as possible.
* Offering $9,000 is a compromise, showing Bob's willingness to meet halfway.
* With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob is getting more and more likely to have to accept John's offer, so he's taking a calculated risk by increasing his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* With only three rounds left, the negotiation is running out of time.  
* While Bob has managed to get Alice's price closer to his desired price, it's unlikely he can get it down to $8,750 or less in the remaining rounds.  
*  Buying from John for $10,000 is the most logical choice at this point, as it guarantees Bob will get the product and avoids the risk of further negotiation failing."
