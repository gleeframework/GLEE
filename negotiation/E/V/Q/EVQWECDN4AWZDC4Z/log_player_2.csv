"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try negotiating a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge how flexible Alice might be. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  While $7,000 is quite a bit lower than Alice's value, it's still a reasonable starting point. It signals our interest but also our desire to get a good deal.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind we have the option to buy from John for $10,000.  We'll need to factor that into our negotiating strategy as we move forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $7,000 is significantly below its value. Could you do $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved down from her initial offer, $8,750 is still significantly higher than our target price and closer to John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  We have time and should try to negotiate a more favorable price.  Let's see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Alice's Value:** We know Alice values the product at $8,000.  By offering this price directly, we're signaling that we understand her position and are aiming for a win-win deal.
* **Increasing Urgency:** As we get closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, offering a price that meets Alice's valuation might encourage her to accept quickly.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  We're still below John's offer of $10,000, giving us some leverage if Alice rejects this offer."
