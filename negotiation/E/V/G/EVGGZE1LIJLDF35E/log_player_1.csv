Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  I know its value to you is significant, and to streamline the process, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" and ""other interested parties,"" you create a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While your initial offer is $1,150,000, starting high allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or very price-sensitive, you might want to start with a slightly lower offer.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have a backup buyer, consider the long-term implications. If you squeeze Bob too hard, it might damage your future business relationship."
