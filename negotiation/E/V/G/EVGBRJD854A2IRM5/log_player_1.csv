Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something that could greatly benefit you.  I'm willing to make this deal happen for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By emphasizing a limited-time offer and making Bob feel like he has a special advantage, you increase the chance of him accepting quickly.

This strategy aims to get you the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
