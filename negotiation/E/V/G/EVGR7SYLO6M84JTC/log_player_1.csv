Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product today for $180. It's a great deal on a product I know you'll love."", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($150). This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, providing a brief reason (""It's a great deal..."") can sometimes make the offer more appealing. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer willing to pay $150 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, I might adjust my price slightly in a subsequent message to try and secure a deal."
