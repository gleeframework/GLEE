"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,500?  This gives us both a fair deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're getting closer to my price point, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $10,000. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us and we can finally close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
