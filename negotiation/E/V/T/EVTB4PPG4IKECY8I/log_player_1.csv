"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing Message:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and framing the offer as a good deal for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with an open question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully closed the deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth my time to continue negotiating with him, or if I should move on to John and get my guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still far below my desired price point. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob through negotiation.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions. My goal is to secure a price closer to my desired value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,500?  This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Maintaining Value:**  While I'm lowering the price, $10,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, and closer to my desired outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good price for the product, and the negotiation is complete.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to evaluate his counteroffer. Depending on the price, I might choose to make another counteroffer, or if it's too low, I might move on to John and sell him the product for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for improvement:** I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **John's offer remains attractive:** I know I can get $15,000 from John, so I have the luxury of being patient in this negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, again aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both of us. My goal is to reach a price closer to my desired value, ideally around $10,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're getting closer to my price point, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $10,000. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is right in the middle between my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's current offer ($9,500). This shows flexibility and willingness to reach a deal.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm again framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage him to accept.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm explicitly mentioning that this could be the final offer, creating a sense of urgency and increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! The negotiation is successfully closed.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to carefully evaluate his counteroffer. If it's still too low, I'll move on to John and sell him the product for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to reaching my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to pay $9,750 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $9,750 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Limited Time:** With only 4 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Bob, as I might not have enough time to reach a better deal.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $15,000 would be the best financial outcome, but the negotiation with Bob is already relatively close.  I don't want to miss out on a deal just for the sake of maximizing profit, especially with limited time.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept the offer:** By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a good price and close the deal, minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
