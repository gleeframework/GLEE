Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him a reason to negotiate, but it's still a good deal for me.
* **It's lower than my minimum value:**  I'm open to negotiation, but I won't go below my minimum. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for potential back-and-forth without me having to immediately resort to my backup option (selling to John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  I can try to negotiate further with Bob.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we go with $9,250? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value.  While I'd still prefer to get closer to $9,500, I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to push for a higher price.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
