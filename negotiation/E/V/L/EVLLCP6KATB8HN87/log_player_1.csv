"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This offer leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Time is Money:** While I have 10 rounds, I don't want to waste time on low offers, especially since I have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still plenty of room for negotiation between his offer and what I'm willing to accept.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage to negotiate for a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $90 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  Could you do $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm firmly rejecting his lowball offer but offering a more reasonable price.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to his price while still staying above my minimum.
* **Maintaining Value:** I don't want to drop the price too drastically, as it might make Bob undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $100 is the most I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 matches my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Guarantee of More:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will agree, and I risk losing him as a buyer.
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now avoids further negotiation rounds and potential delays."
