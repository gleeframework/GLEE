"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our respective valuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $9,500 is still a significant loss compared to selling to John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. My counteroffer is $9,600 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise that respects both our interests.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, $9,600 is a decent compromise. It's a much better deal than selling to John and keeps the negotiation moving forward with Bob."
