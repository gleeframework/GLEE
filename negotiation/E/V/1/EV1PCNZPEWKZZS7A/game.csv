"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $800000 is significantly below my budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1000000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $950000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $900000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're able to keep the conversation going. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $900000, which would be $925000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I respect your position,  $925000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $910000. This is a significant investment, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $915000, which is just $5000 above your latest offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a concession to get a deal done. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,7,
