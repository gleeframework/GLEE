"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is the best possible price you can get at this point. Buying from John will cost you an extra $1,000. It's unlikely Alice will get a better offer than this, so accepting is the best decision to save money."
