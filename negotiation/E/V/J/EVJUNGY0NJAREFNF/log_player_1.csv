Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000 is a reasonable starting point.** It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage.**  I want to start a conversation, not just make a demand.
* **I'm aware of John's offer as a backup option.** If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can always fall back to John and still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.**  Accepting it would mean losing money.
* **I have a backup option with John.** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than John's, it's not worth the risk of losing a better deal down the line.
* **I want to see if I can push for a higher price.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm counteroffering with $11,750.** This is the middle ground between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500.
* **The message is still friendly and emphasizes compromise.**  I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm confident in the product's value.
* **I'm still considering John as a backup option.** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll have to reevaluate my options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  Could you do $11,000? That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.**  It's a good deal for me, and I'm not sure I can get much better.
* **I'm not guaranteed to get a better offer from Bob.**  He might not be willing to go higher, and I risk losing the deal altogether.
* **John's offer is a safety net, but not a guaranteed better deal.** While I could sell to John for $10,000, Bob's offer is slightly higher.

**In this situation, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It allows me to secure a sale at a decent price and avoid potentially losing the deal entirely.**"
