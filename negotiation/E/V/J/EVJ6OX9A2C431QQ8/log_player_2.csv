"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet high standards and provide exceptional value. This product is worth more than $80 to me, but I'm willing to start our negotiation at $120. It comes with a unique set of features that I believe could significantly enhance your daily experience. What do you think about this starting price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice is offering the product at $120, there's no advantage to buying from her.  You can get the product for the same price from John, so rejecting her offer and buying from John makes sense."
