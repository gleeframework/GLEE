"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a fantastic opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $115.** This is still higher than your maximum budget of $120.
* **John's offer is $120**, which is your maximum budget, but you're still losing money. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer:**  This keeps the possibility open to negotiate with Alice further or potentially find a better deal elsewhere."
