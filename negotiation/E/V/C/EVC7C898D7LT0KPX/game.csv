"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. My initial offer is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get close to the product's worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but I believe the product's value to you is closer to $1,200,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $950,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, but let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come away satisfied.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think the product's value to you is closer to the higher end of the spectrum. I'm willing to come down to $920,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer in this range.",920000.0,Alice,5,
