It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $175 when you can get it from John for $150.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering $130 for the product. This is a fair price considering your asking price and the fact that I can get it elsewhere for $150."

You have three options:

Alice's offer is still higher than what John is offering. Let's try to negotiate a bit more."

I'm willing to pay $140, which is closer to John's price and a fair compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  At this point, it's better to just buy from John.  The price difference is minimal, and it's not worth risking further negotiation."
