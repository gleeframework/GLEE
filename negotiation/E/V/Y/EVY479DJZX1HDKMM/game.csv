"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,100,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $1,175,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it gives me some wiggle room.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget with $1,175,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, but I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. Can you consider that price?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,150,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,162,500. This would be a great compromise and ensure we both get a fair deal. Let me know if this works for you.",1162500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price of $1,162,500. I'd like to try to get closer to my target of $1,100,000. How about $1,145,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1145000.0,Bob,6,
