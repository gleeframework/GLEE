"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for cheaper by counter-offering.  Since your maximum is $10,000, and Alice's minimum is $8,000, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for Alice to profit. It's also a good starting point for negotiation, and I can adjust my offer further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a little closer to my counteroffer.  I'm still willing to negotiate further. There is still a chance I can get the product for a price that is more favorable than her current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $8,750. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating, but still leaves a bit of room for her to profit. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my maximum budget of $10,000.  I've already countered twice and she's rejected. It seems she's not willing to go lower, and further negotiation could take a lot of time.  It's better to go with John and get the product for $10,000, which is within my budget."
