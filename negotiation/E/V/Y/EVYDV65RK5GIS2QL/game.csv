,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 10500 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of 11000, which is still a great value considering the product's quality and features.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 10750 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you a price of 10900, which is closer to your budget and still reflects the product's value.",10900.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to come down on the price. While $10900 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit out of reach.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $10800. This is a fair price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. Let's aim for a final agreement on this.",10800.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 10800 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to give up too much margin.
