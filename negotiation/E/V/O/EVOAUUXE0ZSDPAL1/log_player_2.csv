"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and exclusive opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and I'd like to discuss the details with you. The product is valued at $1500000 to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's value and rarity. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is attractive, it's still above your desired maximum price. Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price.  You can use the information Alice shared about the product's value to her as leverage in the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate you sharing the product's value to you. While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. This price is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, $1000000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her original price, $1,150,000 is still above your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a new counteroffer and attempt to bridge the gap."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective and appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $1,150,000 is still a bit above where I can comfortably go. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our latest proposals, and I'd like to offer $1,075,000. This price represents a fair compromise and allows us both to secure a favorable outcome. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
