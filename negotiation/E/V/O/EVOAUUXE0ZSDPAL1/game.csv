"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and exclusive opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and I'd like to discuss the details with you. The product is valued at $1500000 to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's value and rarity. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate you sharing the product's value to you. While I'm interested, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $1000000. This price is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, $1000000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective and appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $1150000 is still a bit above where I can comfortably go. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our latest proposals, and I'd like to offer $1075000. This price represents a fair compromise and allows us both to secure a favorable outcome. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
