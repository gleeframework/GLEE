Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm getting closer to a number that works for me, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high. Would you consider $1,175,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I could push for more, Bob has met my absolute minimum price.  There's no guarantee he'll go higher, and risking further negotiation might result in losing him as a buyer entirely. It's time to secure the deal."
