"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to your operations and am confident it's worth significantly more to you than my asking price. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, however, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the asset. It's a truly unique product with the potential to generate substantial returns for you. I'm open to negotiation but need to see a price that reflects its true worth.  Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm getting closer to a number that works for me, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high. Would you consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, that price point is still a significant gap from where I see the value.  This product has the potential to transform your business, and I wouldn't want to undervalue it.  How about we land in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  I appreciate you moving on the price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come up to $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
