Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it offers excellent value at this price, but let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Even though the product is worth $80 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives its value to be higher or needs it urgently.
* **Fallback Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's little risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer. Based on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her price to increase the chances of a sale while still aiming for the highest possible profit."
