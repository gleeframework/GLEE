(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $15,000, and Alice's initial offer is at your limit, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you open the possibility of getting a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $13500? This reflects the value I know this product holds, and still leaves room for us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue haggling and potentially get an even better price."
