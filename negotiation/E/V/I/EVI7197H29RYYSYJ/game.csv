"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $12000?  This is my best offer, and I'm confident this product is worth it at this price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $13500? This reflects the value I know this product holds, and still leaves room for us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go right now.  Would you be willing to meet me at $13000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to find common ground.  Let me know your thoughts.",13000.0,Bob,4,
