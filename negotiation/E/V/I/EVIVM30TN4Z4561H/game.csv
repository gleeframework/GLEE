"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to do $90? I'm ready to buy if we can find common ground.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but $90 is a bit low for me. I can meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be willing to go for that price?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $105? I'm ready to close the deal if we can agree on that.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're getting close to your budget! I can do $108, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really like the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
