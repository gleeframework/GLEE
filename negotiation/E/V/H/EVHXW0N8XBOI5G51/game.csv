,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable meeting you in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9000? It's a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to be happy.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8200? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8200 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. How about we meet at $8800? It's a bit closer to my minimum price, and I'm willing to make a concession to make the deal happen.",8800.0,Alice,5,
