Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:**  I'm highlighting the value Bob places on the product to make the offer more attractive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation, making it clear that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy. 

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've made a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter with a new offer, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the potential of selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Bob's offer is still significantly above my minimum of $8,000. This means there's potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $8,000 would be a loss compared to what Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Building on Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to my desired amount.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter with a price closer to $12,000, but leaving some room for compromise. This will show Bob that I'm serious about negotiating but am also willing to work with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That still leaves you a good deal, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth $15,000 to him, making my counteroffer seem even more attractive. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging Bob to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess if I'm willing to go lower or if it's time to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is just $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject his offer, there's a chance he might walk away entirely, and I'd be left with only the option of selling to John for $8,000.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time, and I might not be able to secure a significantly better price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer to ensure I make a profit and avoid the risk of getting a lower price."
