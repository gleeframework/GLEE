"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I think $9,250 is still a bit too low. How about we meet at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept?",10000.0,Alice,5,
