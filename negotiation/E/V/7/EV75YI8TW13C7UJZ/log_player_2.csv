Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I think $9,250 is still a bit too low. How about we meet at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept?

Alice is not going to go any lower and it's unlikely further haggling will get a better deal. John's offer is now the best option."
