"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob, but I still think we can do better than $950,000. I can meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad you're eager to close the deal, Bob, but I think we can do even better than $1,000,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
