Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives you some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This makes it more likely that Bob will accept the offer.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This ensures that Bob understands your offer. 

By offering $100, you are maximizing your chances of getting a deal with Bob while still leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
