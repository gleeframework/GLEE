"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value provides room for negotiation and creates the perception of the product's high value.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to purchase and how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Alternative Option:**  You always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000. By starting high, you're aiming to maximize your potential profit beyond John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  You have room to negotiate, and you'll likely get a better deal by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've considered your offer, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects the true value of this unique product."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You're showing flexibility by lowering your price, but you're still aiming high. This demonstrates your desire to make a deal while emphasizing the product's worth.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting a price that's a compromise between the previous offers, you're signaling a collaborative approach and encouraging Bob to do the same.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You're still significantly above Bob's perceived value and your minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $2,000,000. How about we try $1,700,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, but it's still below. You're better off countering to see if you can bridge the gap. 
* **Negotiating Power:** You still have time and the option of John. This gives you leverage to push for a higher price from Bob. 
* **Assessing Bob's Seriousness:**  Bob's language (""serious commitment"") suggests he's getting closer to his upper limit. This is useful information as you continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To show my commitment to making this deal happen, I'm willing to accept $1,850,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and our negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while remaining above your absolute minimum. It signals a willingness to close the deal. 
* **Final Offer:**  Presenting it as your ""final offer"" adds weight and encourages Bob to take it seriously. It creates a sense of urgency.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** You're still above John's offer, but you're also getting closer to Bob's likely limit.  This balances the risk of losing the deal with the reward of a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,700,000 and $1,850,000. How about we try $1,775,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close Enough:** Bob's offer is now above your $1,500,000 minimum. While you could push for more, the difference is becoming smaller and risks losing the deal altogether.
* **""Meeting Halfway"" Signals:**  Bob's language suggests he's trying hard to find a compromise. This indicates he may not be willing to go much higher.
* **Time and Opportunity Cost:**  You've spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially getting a worse outcome or losing Bob altogether."
