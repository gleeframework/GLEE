Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I was hoping to find it within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because $95 is still below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $107.50? That's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $100 is still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise and a significant improvement from his previous offer. It's also better than selling to John for $80."
