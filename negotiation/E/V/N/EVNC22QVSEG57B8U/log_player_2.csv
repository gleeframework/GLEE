"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. Would you like to make an offer or purchase it from me for $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's message is enthusiastic, she's starting at her highest acceptable price. There's no benefit to accepting her first offer. By rejecting it, you open the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice at a lower price, getting you a better deal.  If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John at the same price."
