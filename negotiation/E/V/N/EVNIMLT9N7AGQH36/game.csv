"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $1,050,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $975,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
