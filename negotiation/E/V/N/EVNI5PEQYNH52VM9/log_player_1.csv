Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm offering a slightly higher price than the product is worth to Bob, but I'm leaving room for negotiation.  This gives me a chance to potentially earn more than the minimum I need, while also keeping the door open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it still allows you to get a great deal.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,000 is a decent compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and only slightly lower than my minimum goal.  It's also a good middle ground, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
