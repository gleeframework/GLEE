"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to us, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's start with $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal.  He's willing to pay up to $120, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows for a more favorable negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $95 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $80,  which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his maximum price of $120 and Alice's starting price of $95. He's offering $80, which is a significant reduction. This strategy aims to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially reach a quick agreement."
