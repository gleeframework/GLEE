Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000,  it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies there might be some flexibility, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a deal even if he doesn't negotiate down. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring the sale of the product."
