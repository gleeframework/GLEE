Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,000,000 is higher than Bob's $800,000 valuation, but it gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still above your minimum of $1,200,000, but I'm willing to negotiate down to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **It's a strong starting point:** A confident opening offer sets the tone for the negotiation and shows Bob you're serious about selling the product. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal, especially since I have John as a backup buyer.  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's a reasonable compromise:** It's in the middle of Bob's offer ($900,000) and my previous offer ($1,000,000). 
* **It shows flexibility:**  It demonstrates that I'm open to negotiating and willing to meet Bob halfway.
* **It's still within my range:** While it's below my ideal price of $1,200,000, it's closer to my desired outcome than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $920,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,200,000.  I've already made a significant concession, and I'm confident John will be willing to pay my asking price. It's time to move on and secure the best possible deal."
