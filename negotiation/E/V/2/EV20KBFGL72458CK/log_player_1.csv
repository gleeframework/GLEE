"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate, and I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price as possible.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium to secure the product right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price, but still keeping it significantly above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than his current offer. I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with another counteroffer.  John's offer is still a safe fallback, but I'm determined to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm finally offering my minimum price.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm hoping he'll agree to this price.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm not willing to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd love to get a slightly better price from Bob, we're running out of rounds.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum price, and I'm not comfortable risking getting stuck with a lower price in the remaining rounds.  It's time to take the secure option."
