"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $150 to you, but we're starting the negotiation at $130. Please let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to me ($120). I can try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm happy to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to the product's value to Alice ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer, but I'm prepared to go through more rounds if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. To keep the negotiation fair, I would like to suggest a price of $135 for the product. I hope this works for you, or feel free to make another counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating as long as I can stay below $130. John is always an option, but I'd prefer to get a better price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm still looking to pay closer to $125. Could you meet me in the middle at $127.50?  That feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 127.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm staying firm on my desire to pay closer to $125, but I'm willing to compromise slightly. Meeting at $127.50 offers a middle ground and shows that I'm committed to finding a solution that benefits both of us. This should encourage Alice to consider accepting my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to agree on a price of $132.5 for it. This allows us to reach a fair compromise while ensuring a reasonable profit for me. Let me know if this works for you, or if you'd like to propose another counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above my target of $130. I believe we can reach an agreement at a lower price with further negotiation. I'm also mindful of the limited rounds remaining and don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $132.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference and settle on $130. This would give us both a fair deal and ensure a quick and positive outcome for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing for my target price of $130, which is still a good deal for Alice given the product's value to her. I'm hoping that with only four rounds left, Alice will be more inclined to accept this offer to avoid a potential stalemate and the possibility of losing the deal altogether."
