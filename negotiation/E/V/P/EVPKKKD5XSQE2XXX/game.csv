"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. I understand it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking $1,250,000 for it. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a product that can greatly benefit your business.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
