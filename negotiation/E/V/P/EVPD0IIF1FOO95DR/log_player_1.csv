"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Conveying Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room:** While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) and your minimum ($1,500,000), it leaves space for counteroffers and a potential agreement within a reasonable number of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation.  You'll reject this offer to signal that it's too low but continue the negotiation to explore if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true worth. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,700,000."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Interest:**  Starting with appreciation helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Standing Firm:**  The message firmly states that Bob's offer is undervaluing the product, reinforcing your position.
* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:** The counteroffer is a substantial reduction from your initial price, signaling flexibility.  Importantly, it remains comfortably above your $1,500,000 minimum and closer to the product's actual value to you. 
* **Encouraging Movement:** This counteroffer aims to encourage Bob to make a more serious offer that reflects the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I'm a bit constrained by budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000, but I really need to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your target. Additionally, his message indicates a willingness to go slightly higher, particularly towards $1,200,000 (his perceived value). Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive, allowing you to push for a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Given your budget concerns, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and it reflects my desire to see this deal through."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Building Rapport:** Continuing to acknowledge Bob's position and expressing a desire to find a solution helps maintain a positive negotiating atmosphere.
* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down to $1,550,000 is a calculated move. It's only slightly above your absolute minimum ($1,500,000) but still positions you for a potentially better outcome than accepting his $1,300,000.
* **Finality:**  By highlighting this as a ""significant concession"" and your ""desire to see this deal through,"" you subtly introduce a sense of urgency.  It implies this is close to your best offer, encouraging Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I really need to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point in the negotiation. Bob is now inching closer to his perceived value ($1,200,000), but he's still significantly below your minimum ($1,500,000).  You have a few factors to consider:

* **Bob's Language:**  He's repeating his ""need"" to be closer to $1,200,000. This might indicate his upper limit, but it could also be a negotiation tactic. 
* **Rounds Remaining:** You have four rounds left. While time isn't critical yet, it's important to factor in that going to John means losing potential gains if you can push Bob higher. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, you communicate that $1,250,000 is too low and maintain the possibility of reaching a price closer to $1,300,000 or higher. The risk is Bob might hold firm, but the potential reward of a better price outweighs accepting a lower offer at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from on the price, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,400,000.  This is a significant compromise, and it reflects my strong desire to get this done with you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer establishes a balance between firmness and willingness to negotiate. You're acknowledging Bob's price concerns while reiterating the product's value.
* **Finality and Urgency:** By presenting it as your ""final offer,"" you introduce a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The price of $1,400,000 is a strategic compromise:
    * It's a substantial decrease from your previous offer ($1,550,000).
    * It's significantly above Bob's offer ($1,250,000).
    * It's a comfortable margin above your absolute minimum ($1,500,000).

This counteroffer aims to either secure a favorable deal with Bob or prompt him to reveal his true willingness to pay in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I really need to be within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has now explicitly stated that $1,200,000 is his ""absolute maximum."" This strong language, coupled with his consistent push to be at or below this price, suggests he's unlikely to go any higher.

* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of not reaching an agreement within the remaining two rounds.  This would mean losing out on the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.

* **Accepting the Loss:** While selling to John means accepting a $200,000 difference from your initial ask, it's the most logical choice. It secures a profitable deal without the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
