"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $7,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to settle at $7,100?",7100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,300. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",7300.0,Alice,5,
