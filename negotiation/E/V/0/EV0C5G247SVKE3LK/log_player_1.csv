Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant profit. This strategy assumes Bob is genuinely interested but might be hesitant to pay top dollar. We'll see how he reacts and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll counter with a lower price but aim to stay above my minimum.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested in negotiating or just trying to lowball me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to keep negotiating.  $900,000 is still a good profit for me and hopefully a reasonable offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and represents a good profit. While I could potentially continue negotiating and try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
