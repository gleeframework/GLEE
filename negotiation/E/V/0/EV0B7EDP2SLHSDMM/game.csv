"I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit short on budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm comfortable with. This is the last offer I can make, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
