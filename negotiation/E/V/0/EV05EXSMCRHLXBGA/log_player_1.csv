"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's well worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000).  This gives me room to negotiate and leaves the possibility of a good profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the ""unique opportunity"" and ""investment potential"" of the product without revealing specific details that Bob could use to undervalue it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:**  Bob's counteroffer is exactly at my minimum, which is too low for me. It suggests he's trying to take advantage of my need to sell. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I have 9 rounds left, and I'm not in a rush to sell to John.
* **Exploring Further:**  I want to gauge Bob's real budget and see if there's some middle ground we can find."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not able to go that low at this point.  Considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This is a fair price that allows me to continue the negotiation and hopefully find a mutually beneficial solution.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm rejecting Bob's low offer, but I'm not immediately going to John. I'm showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Moderate Counter:** I'm offering a price that's a reasonable middle ground.  It's above Bob's offer but significantly lower than my initial offer, indicating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""mutually beneficial"" to maintain a positive and collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1600000. I hope this proposal is within your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Not Enough:**  Bob has moved closer to my desired price, but $1,600,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm still not ready to sell to John. There's a good chance I can get a better price from Bob with a few more rounds. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  I want to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price that's closer to $1,750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit below my desired range. To keep the negotiation moving forward, I'm offering a slightly reduced price of $1,700,000. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a small compromise from my previous offer, showing flexibility. This indicates a willingness to move towards Bob's position while still staying above my minimum.
* **Focused on a Solution:** I emphasize finding a ""solution that works for both of us,"" keeping the tone positive and collaborative.
* **Bridging the Gap:** I use the phrase ""bridge the gap"" to suggest that a deal is within reach and encourages Bob to consider my offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued effort to reach an agreement, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $1650000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not There Yet:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Window Closing:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.
* **Potential for Better Offer:** With only 4 rounds left, I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since Bob has already shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping some pressure on him and hoping to motivate him to increase his offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your offer of $1,650,000, but I'm still hoping for a little more to make this deal worthwhile.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,680,000.  This is a fair compromise that considers both of our needs. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1680000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm making a small concession, moving closer to Bob's price.  This shows flexibility and indicates a genuine desire to close the deal.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm using terms like ""fair compromise"" and ""both of our needs"" to suggest that I'm being reasonable.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm expressing a strong desire to ""make this happen,"" conveying a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Last Chance:** I'm leaving room for one more counteroffer from Bob before I might consider selling to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I am willing to consider $1660000 as a fair compromise. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,660,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,660,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the last two rounds. It's highly unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer again, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.
* **Acceptable Price:** While $1,660,000 is slightly below my desired price, it's still a good profit and above my minimum.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than to risk getting nothing if I continue to negotiate and Bob walks away or if I have to settle for John's lower offer."
