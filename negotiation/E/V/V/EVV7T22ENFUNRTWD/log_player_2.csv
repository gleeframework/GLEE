"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John.  $120 is still quite a ways from our $80 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it leaves room for us to negotiate upwards towards our $80 limit.  It also lets Alice know we're serious about buying, but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $90? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, $90 is still a bit more than we want to spend. Let's try to negotiate a bit closer to our $80 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That seems fair to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're getting closer! This counteroffer moves us closer to our ideal price while still leaving some room for Alice to potentially counter if she's really motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not quite comfortable with $75, but I'm willing to try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $85? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is very close to our limit and it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting at $85 saves us $5 compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
