"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $700,000 is closer, but I'm still a little ways off. How about we try $600,000 and see if we can make a deal there?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
