"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There are more rounds, and Bob has the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.  Additionally, the option to buy from John provides a safety net if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should start by offering his maximum budget of $800,000. This immediately shows Alice that Bob is serious about acquiring the product but has a strict budget constraint.  While it's likely Alice will reject this offer, it sets the stage for a negotiation where Bob can gradually increase his offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still not a good deal for Bob.  There are still several rounds left to negotiate, and Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to counteroffer.  The option to buy from John remains a good backup if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should increase his offer slightly to $850,000. This demonstrates that he's willing to compromise but is still mindful of his budget.  It's a reasonable compromise considering the limited number of rounds.  If Alice rejects, Bob can continue to increase his offer incrementally in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. He has already offered $850,000, which is closer to his budget than Alice's current offer. There are still a few rounds left, and Bob should continue to negotiate.  He can counteroffer again and try to reach a compromise.  He can also use the option to buy from John as a safety net if the negotiation with Alice becomes too difficult."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should increase his offer to $900,000. This is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing that he's willing to move closer to Alice's price.  However, it's still within a range that is reasonable for Bob's budget. With only a few rounds remaining, it's important to demonstrate a willingness to compromise.  If Alice rejects, Bob can continue to increase his offer in the next round, but it will be a close call."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only three rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice is increasing. Alice's offer is still too high for Bob, and with each round, the likelihood of getting a lower price from Alice is decreasing.  Given the limited time, it's wiser for Bob to secure the product from John at a price that's within his budget.  This ensures that Bob gets the product and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation with Alice."
