Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a solid price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's try to bridge the gap and reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I've made several concessions to Bob, but I'm not confident that I'll be able to get a price that I'm comfortable with.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
