"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer of $10,000.  This is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 
I will counteroffer Bob with a price of $13,000. This is still a good deal for him considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer of $11,000. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or by selling to John.  It's only round 4, and I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price of $12,500. This is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and his last offer. I believe this price is fair and still leaves some room for negotiation if he's not ready to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer of $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than selling to John for the same amount. There's no guarantee I'll get a higher offer in the remaining rounds, and it's not worth the risk."
