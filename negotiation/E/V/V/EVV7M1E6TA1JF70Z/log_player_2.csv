"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  You have no information about the product's value to her, so there's a chance you can get it for less.  Rejecting and counteroffering gives you more information and potential for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower price than Alice's offer gives us leverage.  We have no idea what the product is worth to Alice, so a low counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation.  We can then adjust our offers based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, it's still higher than your initial counteroffer. There's still potential to negotiate further. Rejecting and counteroffering again could lead to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, lowering her price by $2,000.  We're going to increase our counteroffer slightly,  moving it closer to her latest offer. This keeps the pressure on while also demonstrating a desire to reach a deal. We'll see if she's willing to compromise further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to our desired price range, but we can still push for a better deal.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice and might lead to a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has now dropped her price to $12,500, which is within our $15,000 limit.  However, we're going to try and get it for just a bit less.  Our counteroffer of $12,000 is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, Alice will see the value in closing the deal."
