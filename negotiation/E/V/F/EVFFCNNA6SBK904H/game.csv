"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and agree on $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer it to you for $98. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
