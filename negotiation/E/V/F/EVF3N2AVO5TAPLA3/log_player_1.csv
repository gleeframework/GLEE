"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is truly interested.  It's a strong opening position that positions me for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable, I'm not willing to settle right away. I want to see if I can get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,400,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $1,300,000.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price that reflects the value of the product.  It's a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm hoping this will entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'm also concerned that if I sell to John, I may miss out on an opportunity to get a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer one last time to $1,250,000. This is very close to my minimum acceptable price and shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with John, so I'll sell the product to him for $1,200,000."
