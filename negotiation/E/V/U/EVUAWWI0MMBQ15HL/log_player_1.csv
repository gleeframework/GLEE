Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially asked for more. If he negotiates, you can work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup Plan:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net. You're not desperate, which strengthens your negotiating position with Bob."
