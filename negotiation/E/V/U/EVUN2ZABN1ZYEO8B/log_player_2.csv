{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a lower price point, aiming to close the gap between Alice's asking price and my maximum value.  A $10 reduction from the initial offer shows I'm serious about buying but also sets the stage for further negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my maximum value, it's still a bit high. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get Alice to come down further.  There are still rounds left, and I want to explore all possibilities for getting the best price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is coming back up with her offer. While $95 is closer to my maximum value, I'm going to hold out for a better deal. With more rounds left, I want to see if I can get Alice to accept a lower price closer to my counteroffer of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my offer again to $85. This is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her previous offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still staying within my acceptable price range. It increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer again."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $100 is my maximum value.  While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement, and I'll end up with nothing. John offers the same price, but with a guaranteed sale. It's time to take the safe option and buy from John."
