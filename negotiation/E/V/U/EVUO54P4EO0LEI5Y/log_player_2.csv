``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $8,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $7,000 is a significant drop from her initial offer, but I think it's a reasonable starting point for our counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Alice is coming down a bit, but it's still a little too high. I'm going to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $7,500.  It's a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and I'm hoping it will get us closer to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still too high. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7750}
```

I'm offering $7,750, splitting the difference between my last offer and Alice's offer. This shows I'm serious about a deal but still aiming for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not budging much, and we're running out of rounds. It's better to go with John's offer at this point, as it's guaranteed and will save me some money compared to Alice's latest offer."
