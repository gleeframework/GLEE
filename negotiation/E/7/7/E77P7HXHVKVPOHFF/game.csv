"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to acquire the product for a slightly lower price. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the potential benefits we both stand to gain from this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This shows my commitment to the deal, and I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still feel that $1,300,000 is a bit low for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm counteroffering at $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and my initial offer.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
