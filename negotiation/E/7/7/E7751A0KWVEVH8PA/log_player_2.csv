"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $1300000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,300,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** Bob wants to start with a bold counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This signals his serious intent to negotiate and sets the stage for a lower final price.
* **Fairness:** The counteroffer is still above Bob's minimum price (from John), showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:** The message is polite but firm, emphasizing a desire to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this incredible product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob's Budget:** Alice's offer of $1,200,000 aligns perfectly with Bob's maximum budget. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate a lower price, there's a risk Alice might reject the offer, and further rounds might not yield a better price.
* **Time Pressure:**  There are only 7 rounds left, and continuing to negotiate might be too risky, especially if Bob wants to secure the product.

By accepting the offer, Bob gets the product at a price within his budget and avoids potentially losing the deal with Alice or having to buy from John at the same price."
