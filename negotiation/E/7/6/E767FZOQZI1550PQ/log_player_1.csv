Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that could be a great addition to your business.  I'm confident this price reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming for a negotiation that allows for some wiggle room. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $900,000 leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer that still allows me to earn more than John's offer. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value and benefits for Bob, increasing his interest in negotiating further. 
* **Next Steps:** I'll be prepared to counter Bob's offer if he rejects my initial proposal, with the ultimate goal of reaching a price that's closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $650,000?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $650,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000 and even below Bob's perceived value of $800,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.  I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 is a safety net, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $650,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  This price still allows you a significant return on your investment, and it's closer to the product's true value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Rationale:**  My counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and my desired price.  
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize the value and potential return on investment for Bob to encourage him to consider my counteroffer.
* **Compromise:** By proposing $750,000, I demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Next Steps:**  I'm prepared to further adjust my price if Bob rejects this counteroffer, but I'm optimistic that this offer is more likely to lead to a successful agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $750,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer, considering the potential risks and rewards involved.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $700,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and potentially build a relationship with Bob for future business opportunities. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and potentially lead to Bob losing interest or finding an alternative. 
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 would be ideal, I'm  balancing that against the possibility of future deals with Bob.

Accepting this offer allows me to make a profit and move forward with a sale.  The experience gained from this negotiation could also be valuable in future deals."
