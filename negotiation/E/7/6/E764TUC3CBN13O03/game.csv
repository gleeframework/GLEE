"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product, which I believe is fair given its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your input. Considering the value you place on the product and our costs, I'd like to counter your offer with a price of $110. This is a reasonable compromise that reflects both the value you see in the product and our business interests.",110.0,Alice,3,
