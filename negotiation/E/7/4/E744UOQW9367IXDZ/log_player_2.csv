You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is offering the product at her own value, leaving no room for you to save money. Since you know John will sell it for the same price, there's no disadvantage to rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if you can get a better deal elsewhere."
