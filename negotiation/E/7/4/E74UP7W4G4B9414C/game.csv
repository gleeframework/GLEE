"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the uniqueness of the item, but I believe I can only afford to pay up to $10000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I still feel that $13000 is a bit too high for me. I would like to propose a price of $12000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe that $12500 is a bit too high for me. I would like to propose a final price of $12000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,6,
