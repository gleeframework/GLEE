{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm indicating that I'm open to discussing the price further. 
* **Plan B:** I have a backup buyer in John, which gives me leverage if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even below my initial offer of $12,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room to negotiate further with Bob. He's shown interest and is willing to compromise.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price that's still a good deal for you, and it allows us to close this transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000.
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:** I'm reminding Bob that the price is still a good deal for him.
* **Emphasizing the deal:** I'm highlighting the benefits of closing the deal now, to incentivize Bob to accept.

This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,750. I'm close to my limit, but I really want to make a deal. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $10,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, indicating there's room for further negotiation.
* **John's offer is still better:** I can always sell to John for $15,000, which is a much better deal for me.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my preferred price, but still acknowledging his willingness to compromise."
