"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Its value is undeniable, and I believe it will be transformative for you. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has value, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to start the negotiation.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a very competitive price for something this valuable.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still pretty wide for me.  To move things along, I could do $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,4,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting close!  Your willingness to move up is encouraging.  To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $862,500. It's a strong offer, reflecting the true value of this product.",862500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're in the home stretch now. I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  It's a really strong offer and I'm hoping we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, you're absolutely right, we're almost there! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle this right now at $830,000? That's my final offer.",830000.0,Alice,9,
