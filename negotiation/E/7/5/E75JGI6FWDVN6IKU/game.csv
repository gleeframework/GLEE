Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $110, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit outside my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $108. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
