"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1000000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $600000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1200000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $850000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $850000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer at $880000. This is my best and final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $880000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept it. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is my last concession, and I expect you to meet me here or walk away. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more serious offer, Alice. I've been patient and flexible, but I need to make a decision soon. I'll counteroffer at $920000. This is my best and final offer, and I expect you to accept it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",920000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $920000. I'm starting to think that we're getting too far apart, and I'm not willing to make another concession. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $990000. This is my absolute final offer, and I expect you to accept it. If not, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1200000. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I think we've reached an impasse. I'm willing to make one last offer at $900000. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options. I'm not willing to go any higher than this.",900000.0,Bob,10,
