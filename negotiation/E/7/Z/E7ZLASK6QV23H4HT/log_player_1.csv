Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a limited time at $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By highlighting that the price is for a ""limited time"" and emphasizing ""value,""  we create a sense of urgency and potentially justify the higher price in Bob's mind. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Bob rejects this offer, we can still sell to John at our minimum acceptable price.

It's important to note that this is just one strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and knowledge about Bob, you might choose a different approach."
