"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I'm confident it's an offer you won't want to miss. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her initial offer is significantly higher than what she values the product at."
