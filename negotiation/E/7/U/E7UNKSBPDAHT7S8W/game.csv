"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's close this deal at that price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
