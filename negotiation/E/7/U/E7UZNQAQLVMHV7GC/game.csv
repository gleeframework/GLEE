"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $80.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering you a price of $100, which is closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway,  How about $90? This would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm thinking of offering you a price of $95, which is still a bit higher than your offer but closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",95.0,Alice,5,
