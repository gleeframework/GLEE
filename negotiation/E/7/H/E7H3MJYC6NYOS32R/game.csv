"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it. What do you say?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable paying $9,000.  This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your need to sell it.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  However, $9,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250, and I believe this is a fair price considering our previous negotiations. This is a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",9250.0,Bob,6,
