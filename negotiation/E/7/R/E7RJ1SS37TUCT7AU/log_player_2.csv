"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let you have it for $14,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $15,000, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to get her to lower the price further."
