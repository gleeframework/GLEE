"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm personally very attached to, but I'm ready to let it go for the right price. I'm confident it would be worth at least $1,500,000 to you, as it is to me.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,550,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other interested parties waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $1,550,000, which is more than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject the offer and buy from John for $1,500,000, as that fits your budget."
