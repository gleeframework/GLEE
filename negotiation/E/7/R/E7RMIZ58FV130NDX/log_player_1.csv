Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, my budget is quite limited, and I am only willing to pay up to $15000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $15,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $16,500? This would still allow me to get a decent return on my investment, and it's closer to your budget."", ""product_price"": 16500}
