"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this incredible product, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows us both to make a deal. Let's find a middle ground here.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
