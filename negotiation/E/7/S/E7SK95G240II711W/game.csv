"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something truly special and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business.  I'm starting with a price of $1200000, reflecting its value and potential. I'm open to discussing this further and exploring ways to make this a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1200000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $800000. This aligns more closely with what I am able to invest at this time.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While I am willing to negotiate, $800000 is unfortunately below the minimum value I can accept for this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a price of $950000. This reflects the significant value this product offers, while also acknowledging your budgetary limitations.  I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm open to further discussion. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value I believe the product can bring to our business, I would like to counter with an offer of $900000. This is the highest I can go while still making a sound investment for our company.",900000.0,Bob,4,
