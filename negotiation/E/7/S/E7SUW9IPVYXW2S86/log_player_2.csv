Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. At this point, it's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a lower price, and time is a factor."
