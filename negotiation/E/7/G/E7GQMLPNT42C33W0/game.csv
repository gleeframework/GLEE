"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $125?  That's the highest I can go right now.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I really think this product is worth more than $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $140. Let's make a deal!",140.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I'll offer you a compromise at $165. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll love the product at this price.",165.0,Alice,5,
