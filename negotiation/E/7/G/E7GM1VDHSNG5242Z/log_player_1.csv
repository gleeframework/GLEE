Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This allows for room to negotiate down.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the message in a positive and enthusiastic way to encourage Bob's interest.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm clearly stating that I'm open to discussing the price, which shows flexibility and a willingness to reach a deal.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy.  If he rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine whether it's worth pursuing further negotiation or if it's better to sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am very interested, but I can only afford to pay $8000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in risking further negotiation, as I'm already at my limit.
* **Time is money:** I'm trying to maximize profit, and engaging in further negotiation could take time and potentially lead to a lower offer. 
* **John's offer is the same:** John is offering the same price as Bob, so there's no advantage to selling to John over Bob.

**Conclusion:** It's most efficient to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale at my minimum acceptable price."
