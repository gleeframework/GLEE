"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this exclusive product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a competitive price considering its value and uniqueness.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $600000 for it.  This represents a fair value considering the potential benefits, and leaves room for both of us to gain from this deal.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $600000. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's unique value and potential benefits.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $700000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.
