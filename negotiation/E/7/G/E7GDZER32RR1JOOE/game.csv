"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $15,000? It's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at that price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
