"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of this product and its potential to benefit your business."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still feel that $1,900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiation to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

While $1,700,000 is a significant sum, we're still in early stages of negotiation. I believe I can still get closer to $2,000,000 with some more back and forth."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while ensuring a fair deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but I need to be mindful of my financial constraints. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While ideally, I'd like to get closer to $1,700,000, Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is still significantly more than John's offer of $1,500,000. It's getting late in the negotiation, and there's a risk Bob might reduce his offer further. Accepting now secures a good profit."
