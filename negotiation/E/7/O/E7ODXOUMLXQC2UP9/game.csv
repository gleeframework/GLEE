"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of this product and its potential to benefit your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still feel that $1,900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiation to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while ensuring a fair deal.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but I need to be mindful of my financial constraints. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
