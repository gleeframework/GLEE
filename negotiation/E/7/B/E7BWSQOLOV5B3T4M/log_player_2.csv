"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I know it's something you'd find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:**  She's moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer,  reducing the price by $1,000 from her initial offer. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Bob has already rejected one offer and has only 7 rounds left.  There's a risk that the negotiation could go on too long and he'll have to resort to buying from John, which is more expensive.
* **Value for Bob:** At $13,000, Bob is still saving $2,000 from John's price and getting a product worth $10,000 to Alice.

Accepting this offer is a balanced decision, securing a good price while acknowledging the potential for the negotiation to drag on."
