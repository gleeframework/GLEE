{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer allows for some room for negotiation while still ensuring you get a good price.  Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he might be willing to pay a bit more than my offer.  It's also important to consider the possibility of reaching a deal quickly to avoid selling to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, but I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,380,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1380000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $1,380,000 and is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's a good deal and it's important to avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a rejection or the need to sell to John for a lower price."
