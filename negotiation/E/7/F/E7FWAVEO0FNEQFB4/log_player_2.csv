"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1400000. This is a significant value for you, as it's well below the $1500000 it's worth to you.  While I'm confident in the value I'm offering, I also have another buyer, John, lined up who's willing to pay $1200000. I'm confident you'll find this a good deal, but ultimately the decision is yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
