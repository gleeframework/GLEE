Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's unique and I believe it has great potential for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've left the door open for Bob to counteroffer, setting the stage for a back-and-forth.

This strategy aims to get the best price possible while still being open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter with a price that is higher than $7,500 but lower than my initial offer of $10,000. 
* I'll try to find a middle ground to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $7,500 is lower than I was initially hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I think this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $8,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $7,500. This shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value.
* **Reasoning:** I explain my counteroffer with logic, emphasizing that the price is a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
