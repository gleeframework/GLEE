"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still aiming for a profit beyond my minimum value of $8,000.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John for $8,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering with $9,500. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer.  I believe this price is reasonable, considering my minimum value and Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. Bob has clearly shown that he's not willing to go higher than $8,000.  While I would prefer to get more, selling to John guarantees I meet my minimum value and avoids further negotiation with Bob that might result in a lower price."
