"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to counter-offer, giving us a chance to find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm going to counter-offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first round, but still keeping it above my minimum value. I want to signal to Bob that I'm serious about selling, but also that I'm not willing to accept a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While it's tempting to accept Bob's offer since we're running out of rounds, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm going to counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm making a significant concession this round, as I want to try and get Bob to accept before I have to sell to John. This price is still above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are running out of rounds and Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to guarantee I get my desired price."
