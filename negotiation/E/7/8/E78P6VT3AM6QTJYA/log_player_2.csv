"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've put a lot of effort into, and I know it could be very beneficial for your company. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from what it's truly worth.  This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
