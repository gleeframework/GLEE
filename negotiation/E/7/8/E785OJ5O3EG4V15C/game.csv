"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so please let me know your thoughts.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept. This product offers significant value that I believe justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fairer reflection of its worth. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we try to find a compromise - would $1,100,000 work for you?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I can see we're both motivated to find a deal that works. To meet you closer to the middle, I propose a price of $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,000,000.  I'm willing to offer you $1,200,000 to make this deal happen, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't agree on that, I'll need to go with the other offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
