"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's a negotiation tactic to start with a significantly lower offer than my actual upper limit. This gives room for negotiation and allows Alice to feel like she's getting a better deal in the end. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  While $800,000 is a lowball offer, it leaves plenty of room to negotiate upwards towards my $1,000,000 limit.
* **Alternative Option:**  I always have the option to buy from John at $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Alice immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept. This product offers significant value that I believe justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fairer reflection of its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than my $1,000,000 limit and my previous offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is coming down from her initial offer, which indicates a willingness to negotiate.  There's still room to meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Backup Plan:** The option to buy from John at $1,000,000 keeps me from feeling pressured to accept a bad deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we try to find a compromise - would $1,100,000 work for you?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing the Offer:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm serious about negotiating but staying below my $1,000,000 limit as a buffer.
* **Compromise Language:**  Using phrases like ""find a compromise""  encourages a collaborative approach to the negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help me gauge how much further Alice is willing to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I can see we're both motivated to find a deal that works. To meet you closer to the middle, I propose a price of $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Limit:** $1,650,000 is still significantly above my $1,000,000 limit.
* **Slow Progress:** While Alice is making concessions, the pace is slow. I need to encourage her to drop her price more aggressively if we're going to reach a deal.
* **Time Constraint:** We are now past the halfway point in the rounds, and I need to make it clear I'm willing to walk away if the price doesn't come down to an acceptable level."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,000,000.  I'm willing to offer you $1,200,000 to make this deal happen, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't agree on that, I'll need to go with the other offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Counteroffer:**  I'm presenting a firm counteroffer at $1,200,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer but still allows for a buffer below my actual limit.
* **Introducing Competition:** Mentioning the other offer creates a sense of urgency and lets Alice know I'm serious about walking away if she doesn't meet my needs. 
* **Transparency and Finality:**  Being upfront about my limit and alternative option encourages Alice to make a decision and hopefully avoids unnecessary back-and-forth in the remaining rounds."
