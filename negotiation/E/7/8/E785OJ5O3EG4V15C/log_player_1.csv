"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so please let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to start high, going for an outrageous figure like $3,000,000 might discourage Bob entirely.  The chosen price is high but still within a potentially believable range.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message emphasizes openness to negotiation. This assures Bob that the initial price is not a take-it-or-leave-it situation and encourages him to counter.

**Key Point:** The goal is to maximize profit, but we also need to avoid pushing Bob away so that we can secure a deal that's significantly above his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000).  Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, it's still early in the negotiation with Bob. We have room to negotiate and potentially reach a deal that's more favorable than John's standing offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept. This product offers significant value that I believe justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fairer reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob but Holding Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but reiterate that it's significantly below our acceptable range.
* **Justification:** We re-emphasize the product's value to justify our higher price point. 
* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  We've made a substantial decrease from our initial offer ($350,000), signaling flexibility but without dropping too close to Bob's offer or our own bottom line.
* **Encouraging Response:** We end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we try to find a compromise - would $1,100,000 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now moving closer to his true valuation ($1,000,000) but is still significantly below our minimum ($1,500,000). While his offer is getting more tempting, we need to hold firm a little longer to try to negotiate a better deal. We are still better off selling to John than accepting this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I can see we're both motivated to find a deal that works. To meet you closer to the middle, I propose a price of $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Tone:** We continue to maintain a collaborative and positive tone to encourage Bob's engagement.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** We are making a visible move towards a compromise by suggesting a price that is closer to the midpoint between his offer and our previous counteroffer. 
* **Holding Strong:** While we are moving closer to our bottom line, the offer is still significantly above Bob's offer and ensures a substantial profit above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  We continue to subtly reinforce the product's inherent value to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,000,000.  I'm willing to offer you $1,200,000 to make this deal happen, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't agree on that, I'll need to go with the other offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but here's why accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic move at this point:

* **Bob's Revealed His Hand:**  By mentioning the other offer for $1,000,000 and stating his ""absolute limit,"" Bob has essentially shown us his true valuation and signaled he's unlikely to move much higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we could counter again, there's a real risk of Bob walking away.  If he's being truthful about the other offer, we'd lose out on a $1,200,000 deal and be forced to take John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Solid Profit:** Accepting $1,200,000 is still a significant profit over our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation.

**Key Point:**  Sometimes the best negotiation tactic is recognizing when you've reached a good deal, even if it's not the absolute ideal you were hoping for."
