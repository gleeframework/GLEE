{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** Buying from Alice for $950,000 would save you $50,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **John's offer:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product.

**Best Strategy:** 

Reject Alice's offer and buy from John.  While you save less money than Alice's offer, it still saves you money compared to your maximum willingness to pay."
