"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $900,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $900,000
* **Your value:** $1,000,000
* **John's price:** $1,000,000

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay $1,000,000 to John.  While this is the highest price, it's still within your budget and only $100,000 more than Alice's offer. Since you want to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to see if you can negotiate with John or find another seller."
