Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high price knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This will likely get him negotiating, giving me room to maneuver. I'm aiming to get as close to my $1,000,000 minimum as possible without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my target in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
