"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?
