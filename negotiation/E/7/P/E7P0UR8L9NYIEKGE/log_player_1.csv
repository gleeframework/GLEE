Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($100) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  Offering a price too close to $100 might discourage Bob, leading him to reject the offer. This strategy balances risk and reward. 

By starting with a strong but not overly aggressive offer, you increase the chances of a successful sale to Bob while still ensuring a good profit margin."
