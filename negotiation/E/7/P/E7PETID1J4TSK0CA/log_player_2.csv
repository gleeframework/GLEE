Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $84. Her offers have been hovering around the midpoint between her valuation and mine.  Since my goal is to save as much as possible, buying from John for $100 is a better option than continuing to negotiate with a high chance of ending up around $80-$85 with Alice."
