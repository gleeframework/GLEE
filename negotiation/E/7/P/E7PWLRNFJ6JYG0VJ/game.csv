"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $160 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",160.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised a bit by offering it to you for $180 initially. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $170.",170.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $165 for the product. Can you consider that?",165.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to pay $165, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can offer it to you for $175, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let me know if that works for you.",175.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $165. Can you consider meeting me at $167? That would be a great compromise for me.",167.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $167, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. I'll throw in some extra features and support, and I'll sell it to you for $172. What do you think?",172.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extra features and support, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $168 for the product, considering the extras. Can you meet me at that price?",168.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'll throw in one more extra feature, and I'll sell it to you for $175. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",175.0,Alice,9,
