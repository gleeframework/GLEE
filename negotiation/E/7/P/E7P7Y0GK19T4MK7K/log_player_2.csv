"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $20,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's clearly not a good deal for you. You should reject the offer and proceed to counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.
