"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this incredible product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
