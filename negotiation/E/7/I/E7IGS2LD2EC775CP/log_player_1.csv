I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I think I can still get a higher price from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $110.  How about we meet at $109?  That's just a dollar more than your offer, and it would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 109}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer for $108. Although I'd prefer a higher price, it's close enough to my desired price range and it's more than I would get by selling to John. I'm worried that if I reject Bob's offer again, he might walk away and I'll be stuck selling to John for a lower price."
