"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's valued at $150 for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120.  Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $115? That's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a fair price given the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, which would be $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $110.  How about we meet at $109?  That's just a dollar more than your offer, and it would be a fair price for both of us.",109.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant at $109. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,8,
