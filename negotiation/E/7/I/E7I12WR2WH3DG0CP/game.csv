"Bob, I understand you're looking to save money. However, $750,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. I'm prepared to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $775,000 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference?  I'll sell the product to you for $800,000.  This is my final offer, and it's the same price John is willing to pay.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to secure this valuable product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
