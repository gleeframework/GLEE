Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept ($150) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Not too high:**  $170 is still within a range where Bob might consider it, given he values the product at $80. 
* **Friendly opening:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the counteroffer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $170 to $140, showing flexibility but still staying above my minimum.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** I'm clearly indicating that I'm open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $120 is a bit too low for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $130 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially getting a lower price than what John is offering. 
* **Secure a guaranteed sale:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is my minimum requirement."
