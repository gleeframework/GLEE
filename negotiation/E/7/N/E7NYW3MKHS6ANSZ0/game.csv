"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit above my budget.  How about $115?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
