Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $150. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good strategy to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if general, can make the offer seem more reasonable and less arbitrary. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $150, there's a buffer for Bob to make a counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to pay up to $120 for this product. Thank you for understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate. Bob's message suggests he's interested but wants to see if he can get a better deal. I'll counter to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? I believe that's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's price, signaling willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit margin. 
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the value subtly reinforces my position that the product is worth more than his initial offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me understand how much further Bob is willing to go and if a deal within my desired range is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still unable to go above $120 for this product. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob has not budged from $120 after two rounds of negotiation. This suggests it's unlikely he'll go higher. 
* **Profitable Offer:** While not ideal, $120 is still a $20 profit over my minimum acceptable price and significantly better than John's offer.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and effort. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit without further delay."
