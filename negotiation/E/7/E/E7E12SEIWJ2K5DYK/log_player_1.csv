Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate as the product is worth $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $11,000, I believe I can still get closer to my minimum of $12,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a price of $12,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept, as it's still a good deal for him, and brings me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum and still a good deal for me.  I'm also concerned that if I reject his offer, he may walk away, and I'll be left with only John's offer of $12,000."
