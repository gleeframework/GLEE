"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $150? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $150 is still above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $137.50?  I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $137.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $145, which is a fair compromise. This gives you a good price, and it allows me to get closer to my minimum. Let's close this deal now!",145.0,Alice,5,
