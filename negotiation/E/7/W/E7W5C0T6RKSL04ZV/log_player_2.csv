# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. This is a unique product, and I believe it will bring you a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,700,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product and its potential for return.

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to lower the price further."
