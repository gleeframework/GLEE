"Alice,  your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,700,000.  This is my best price, considering the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,700,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product and its potential for return.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000. This is a fair compromise, given my budget and the potential value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
