"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $20000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $12000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $17000? It's a significant discount from my initial price, and still leaves room for me to make a profit.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $17000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $14000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $15500?  This is really a fair price, considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $15500.  Would you be willing to go down to $14500? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally seal the deal.",14500.0,Bob,6,
