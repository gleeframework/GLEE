"Bob, I have a product that I believe you'd be very interested in. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price of $12,000. This gives you a great deal, and it ensures I get a fair return on my investment.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,
