Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're willing to make a significant investment in this product. I'm willing to meet you at $885,000, which is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product to you, while also allowing me to get a fair price. Let's see if we can seal the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is a good deal. You're getting the product for significantly less than what John is offering, and you've already negotiated a substantial discount from Alice's initial price.  Accepting this offer saves you a lot of money and secures the product you want.  Continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal, especially since you only have a limited number of rounds."
