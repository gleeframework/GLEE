"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $110. You can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $100 is below my bottom line.  Would you consider $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You're still saving money compared to buying from John, and Alice is only $5 away from your ideal price.  It's likely you won't get a better deal than this."
