Considering the product's value to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875000. Considering the product's value to you is $800000, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $885000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is very close to his target price of $800,000. However, Alice's offer of $885,000 is still a bit too high.  Bob should continue negotiating in hopes of getting a better deal, but he also needs to be mindful of the limited rounds remaining.  He should consider the potential of buying from John as a backup option."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $865000. Considering the product's value to you is $800000, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $880000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is coming down in price, she is still too high for Bob.  With only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob will be able to negotiate down to his target price of $800,000.  It's time to cut his losses and secure the product from John for $800,000.  This is the best option for Bob at this point to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
