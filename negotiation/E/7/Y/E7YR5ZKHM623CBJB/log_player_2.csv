"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way over his budget. He should try to negotiate with Alice and see if he can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is unfortunately a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still over his budget. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a price closer to his target of $8,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product and would like to buy it, but my budget is firm at $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,500, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer it to you for $9,500. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has come down in price, $9,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  He's already made two counteroffers and Alice has rejected them. It's likely further negotiation will not yield a lower price. It's better for Bob to go with John and get the product for his desired price."
