"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept an offer that's higher than his maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,250 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget. He should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. I'm confident you'll find the value of this product to be worth it at that price. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get a better deal from John for $8,000, so it's not worth accepting Alice's offer at $9,000.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $8,800. It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to what we want. Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but $8,800 still isn't quite there for me. How about we meet at $9,000?  It's only $200 more than your last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. This product is truly exceptional, and you'll be glad you invested in it. Let's seal the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is sticking to a price point that is above Bob's budget, and there's no guarantee she will come down further.  Since John is offering the product for $8,000, which is within Bob's budget, it's the best course of action to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
