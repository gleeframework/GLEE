Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value, but still leaves me room to negotiate if Bob rejects the offer. I want to start with a price that's attractive to him, but also leaves me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the following rounds.  While I could sell to John now for $12,000, I'm hoping I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price from Bob. I'm hopeful that we can come to an agreement within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. I'm confident you'll find the value of this product to be worth it at that price. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $8,800. It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to what we want. Let's make this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  I have a few rounds left and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement on a price that works for both of us."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $8,800 still isn't quite there for me. How about we meet at $9,000?  It's only $200 more than your last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. This product is truly exceptional, and you'll be glad you invested in it. Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
