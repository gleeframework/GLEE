"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.  Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. Let's see if we can make this work.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. I'm confident you'll find the value of this product to be worth it at that price. Let me know your thoughts!",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $8,800. It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to what we want. Let's make this deal!",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $8,800 still isn't quite there for me. How about we meet at $9,000?  It's only $200 more than your last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. This product is truly exceptional, and you'll be glad you invested in it. Let's seal the deal!",9000.0,Alice,7,
