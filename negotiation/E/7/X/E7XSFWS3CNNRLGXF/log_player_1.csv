Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perception:** While you know the product's worth to Bob, he might not be fully aware of its value. Your message should subtly emphasize the product's benefits.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your initial offer. Having a clear idea of your walk-away point will be helpful."
