"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be closer to $15,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're getting closer!  However, I'm still aiming for something closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
