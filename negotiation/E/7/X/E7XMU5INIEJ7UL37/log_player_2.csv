# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to me. This unique item is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I believe it could significantly enhance your life or business. After careful consideration, I propose to offer this remarkable product to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects a strategic balance between ensuring a fair return on my investment and presenting you with an attractive deal. I am confident that this offer will allow us both to achieve our goals. Should you have any questions or wish to discuss further details, please do not hesitate to reach out. I look forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John at $1,500,000. There's a significant price difference here ($300,000) which gives you room to negotiate with Alice further. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're not immediately convinced and open the door for a counter-offer. She might be willing to lower the price to secure the sale, especially since you're her best option before having to consider the open market."
