"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more equitable price. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a price closer to $900,000 to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I am still committed to finding a price that works for both of us. I would like to counter with an offer of $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm confident that I won't get a significantly better offer from him. While I'd love to reach $900,000, it's important to be realistic and secure a deal.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit significantly higher than selling to John."
