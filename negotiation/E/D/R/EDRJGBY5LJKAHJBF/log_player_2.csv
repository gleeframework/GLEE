"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her minimum value but lower than your maximum value.** This means there's room for negotiation to benefit both parties. 
* **It's early in the negotiation.**  By rejecting the initial offer, you can potentially drive the price down further. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** You can always choose to buy from him if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This reflects the potential value I see, and it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** I'm starting with a lower price than Alice's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. This will likely make Alice more motivated to find common ground.
* **Fair Justification:** I've provided a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value I see in the product and presenting it as a fair starting point for negotiation.
* **Remaining Flexible:** While my counteroffer is aggressive, it's still within a range where I'm willing to buy the product. This leaves room for compromise in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value you've acknowledged the product brings. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at her minimum value.**  This means she's unlikely to go lower. 
* **The price is within your acceptable range.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is significantly lower.
* **Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price.** While further negotiation might be possible, it's not guaranteed, and you risk losing the deal entirely if you reject and Alice decides to walk away. 

By accepting the offer, you save $300,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most advantageous option."
