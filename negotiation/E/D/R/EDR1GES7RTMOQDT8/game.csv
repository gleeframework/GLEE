,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider letting it go for $900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a profitable deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your revised offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",750000.0,Bob,4,
