"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering.  It makes the most sense to go with John's offer and save $9,000."
