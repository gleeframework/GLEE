Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While the product is incredibly valuable, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and potential return on investment."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I still think the product is a bit pricey, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
 
While I could continue negotiating, Bob is steadily moving towards my bottom line. Accepting $875,000 is a significant profit and a better outcome than potentially ending up closer to $800,000 in later rounds."
