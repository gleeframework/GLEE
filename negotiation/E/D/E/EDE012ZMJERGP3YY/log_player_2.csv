"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's below your maximum, you can likely get a better price.  It's worth negotiating further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this stage. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it, considering the value it holds for me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for negotiation. This gives Alice a good reason to counter, hopefully closer to your target price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $750,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being more competitive than my initial offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to offer right now.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product while also allowing for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant improvement from my previous offer, but still leaves room for Alice to negotiate.  I'm confident that $800,000 is a fair price that aligns with the value I see in the product and provides Alice with a decent profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. While it's slightly higher than my last counteroffer, it's still within my budget and significantly lower than John's price.  Given that we're approaching the halfway point in the negotiation, it's wise to accept and avoid further back-and-forth."
