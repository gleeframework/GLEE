"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $500,000 is a significantly lower price than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000). 
* There's a good chance Alice is willing to go higher, so rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a low counteroffer, roughly half of Alice's initial price. 
* This is a strong negotiating tactic, demonstrating my willingness to bargain and potentially pushing Alice to meet me in the middle. 
*  I'm confident that I can get a better price than $500,000, but I'm also aware that Alice might be willing to walk away. 
*  The goal is to start the negotiation process and gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still quite high. 
* I'm confident that I can negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice has already rejected my counteroffer.
* By rejecting her offer again, I'm signaling my intention to continue negotiating and potentially push her further down. 
* Buying from John for $1,500,000 is not an attractive option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer to $300,000, which is halfway between Alice's last offer ($400,000) and my previous offer ($250,000). 
* This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal target. 
* I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and has a good chance of being accepted by Alice, who seems to be willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $350,000 is a good price, considering my initial goal was to save as much money as possible. 
* While I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or further negotiation taking too long is high.
* Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price without risking losing the opportunity entirely. 
* Buying from John for $1,500,000 is far too expensive, and the current offer is significantly better."
