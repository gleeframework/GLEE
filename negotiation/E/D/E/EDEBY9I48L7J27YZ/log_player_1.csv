{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $950000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm confident I can get a higher price.  I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations with Bob, as I know the product is worth more to him than $850,000.  I have 9 rounds left, so I have plenty of time to explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 for this incredible product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $875000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $875,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still confident that I can get a better price.  I believe Bob is willing to pay more, and I want to push for a deal closer to $900,000. I have 6 rounds left, so I have time to work on a more mutually beneficial arrangement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000.  Let's split the difference.  How about $887,500?  That's a fair compromise and a great deal for both of us.  It's a fantastic product, and I'm sure you'll agree it's worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 887500}
