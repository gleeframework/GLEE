"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, considering the value you place on the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I'm still not able to meet you at $1,100,000. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a compromise. I believe this is a fair price given the value I place on the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
