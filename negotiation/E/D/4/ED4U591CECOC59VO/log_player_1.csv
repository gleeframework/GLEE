{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price above the product's worth to me, but still within a range that Bob might find acceptable, considering his own valuation.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response, but if the negotiation stalls, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While it's tempting to sell for $950,000, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, considering the value you place on the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. I'm aiming to stay within a reasonable range for Bob, but still above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping this will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I'm still not able to meet you at $1,100,000. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a compromise. I believe this is a fair price given the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. It's a good deal for me, considering the potential of further negotiation. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a reasonable compromise."
