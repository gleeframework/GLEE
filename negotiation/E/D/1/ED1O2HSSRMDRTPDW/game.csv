"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I can go at this point. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,750 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $8,625? This is the absolute maximum I can afford right now.",8625.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $9,050. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",9050.0,Alice,5,
