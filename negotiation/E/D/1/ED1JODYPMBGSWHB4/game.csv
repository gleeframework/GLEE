"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we bring it down to $750,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750,000. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $850,000 for the product. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $800,000? That feels like a solid compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
