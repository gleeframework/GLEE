As we're both aware, it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $950,000 for the product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we bring it down to $750,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
