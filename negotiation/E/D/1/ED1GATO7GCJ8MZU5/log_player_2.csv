Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $115. It's a great price, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $115, and you have a guaranteed option to buy it for $100 from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
