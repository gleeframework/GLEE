"Alice, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend closer to $8000. Would you be willing to come down to $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $9000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you in the middle, though. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more move, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14000. I can offer it to you for $14000, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,
