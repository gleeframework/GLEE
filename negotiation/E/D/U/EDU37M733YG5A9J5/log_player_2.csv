(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you don't know Alice's minimum selling price.  There's a chance you could get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. I'm aiming for a good deal but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.  I'll continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping it well below Alice's current price. I want to show that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also not willing to pay her full asking price."
