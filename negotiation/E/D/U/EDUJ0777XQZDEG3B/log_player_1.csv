"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product.  I think it could really benefit you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $20,000, we are ""anchoring"" the negotiation at a higher point. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make him more receptive to offers slightly lower than $20,000, but still higher than his perceived value of $10,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** We've left significant space between our asking price and both Bob's valuation and John's guaranteed offer. This gives us flexibility in the upcoming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($10,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. 

It's better to reject this lowball offer and counter with a price that moves the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your initial offer, but $8,000 is significantly below the true value of this product and what I can accept.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** We've moved significantly from our initial offer, demonstrating that we're willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** We're still comfortably above our minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Targeting Above Bob's Value:** Aiming for $14,000 keeps the pressure on Bob. While it's a compromise from our initial price, it's still $4,000 above his perceived value,  giving us room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We're still mindful of John's standing offer of $15,000.  If Bob isn't willing to move closer to a reasonable price in the next round or two, we might consider taking John's offer to avoid further time investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,500?  That feels like a fair offer to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below our minimum of $15,000.  His negotiation tactics suggest he's trying to see how low he can go. We need to hold firm and signal that we're willing to walk away if he doesn't make a substantial move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find common ground, but we're still quite far apart.  I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. $13,000 is my absolute lowest price.  I'm confident this product is worth the investment, but I also need to be fair to myself."", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This message conveys firmness while remaining polite and professional. We're setting a clear boundary by stating our ""absolute lowest price.""
* **Justification:** We're briefly reiterating the product's value while acknowledging Bob's perspective (being fair).
* **Time Constraint:**  We're approaching the halfway point in our negotiation rounds.  Setting this firm price aims to either move Bob closer to a deal or signal that it might be time to walk away and accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product holds value for you, and I respect that you need to be fair to yourself.  How about we try $11,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and we're aiming for the best possible deal. It's likely he's still willing to go higher.  We'll reject this offer to signal that we're serious about our $13,000 bottom line, but we'll use our next counteroffer to potentially incentivize him to move closer to that figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. I'm motivated to close this deal, but $13,000 is the best I can do. To show I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to throw in [add a small but tangible bonus related to the product], which I think you'll find valuable.  Does that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're sticking to our $13,000 price, reinforcing that this is truly our bottom line.
* **Added Value:**  By including a small bonus, we're sweetening the deal without changing our final price. This can make Bob feel like he's getting more for his money and could be the nudge he needs to accept.
* **Sense of Urgency:** We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation. By framing this as our best and final offer, we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
