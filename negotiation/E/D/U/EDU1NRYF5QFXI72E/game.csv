"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a great deal on this valuable product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Alice. Let's aim for a compromise. How about $13,200 for the product? This keeps your profit margin reasonable while staying within my budget.",13200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  $13,200 is a good offer, but I'd really prefer to sell it for $13,400. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while you still get a great deal. What do you say?",13400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your patience. I think we're getting closer. How about we settle on $13,300 for the product? It's a fair compromise for both of us.",13300.0,Bob,6,
