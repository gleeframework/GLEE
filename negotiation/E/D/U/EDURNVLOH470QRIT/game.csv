"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my needs.  While I see the value in this product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I'm still a bit over my budget at $10,500. How about we split the difference and I pay $10,250?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,250 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
