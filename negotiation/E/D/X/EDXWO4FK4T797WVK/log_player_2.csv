# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially offering it at $13,500.  I'm confident this represents a fair price given its potential worth to you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my counteroffer:

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,750?

Round 4
