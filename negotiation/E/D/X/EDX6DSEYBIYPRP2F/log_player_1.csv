Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully earn more than my minimum value.  I'm confident in the product's value, and this price allows me to see if Bob is truly interested in making a significant investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still reflecting the significant value of the product.  This price is closer to my initial offer and should encourage Bob to come closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to significantly undervalue the product. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
