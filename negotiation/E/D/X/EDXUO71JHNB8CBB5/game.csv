"Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $12000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $12000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $17000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14000. If you're not able to meet me there, I might have to explore other options.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and $14000 is closer to what I'm looking for. However, I'm willing to go down to $15000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer.  Otherwise, I'll have to move forward with another buyer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
