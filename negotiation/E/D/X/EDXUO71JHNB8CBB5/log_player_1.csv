{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone in my message to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly highlighting the product's value by saying ""amazing"" and suggesting it's a ""great fit"". 

This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation. Depending on Bob's response, I can adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $12000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. While he's shown interest, accepting his offer would mean a loss for me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $12,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proposing a counteroffer of $17,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer of $20,000 but still above my minimum value.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm explaining my reasoning for the counteroffer, highlighting the product's value and emphasizing a fair and mutually beneficial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage further discussion and keep the negotiation open. 

By showing flexibility while still upholding my value, I aim to reach a compromise with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $17000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14000. If you're not able to meet me there, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up to $14,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $15,000,  I'm not willing to risk a lower price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and $14,000 is closer to what I'm looking for. However, I'm willing to go down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer.  Otherwise, I'll have to move forward with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** I'm making my final counteroffer at $15,000, which is my minimum value. I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing this offer as ""fair"" and a ""win-win"" situation to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Creating Urgency:**  I'm introducing a sense of urgency by mentioning ""another buyer"" to encourage Bob to accept.

This final counteroffer represents my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob.  If he rejects it, I'll move on to my guaranteed sale with John."
