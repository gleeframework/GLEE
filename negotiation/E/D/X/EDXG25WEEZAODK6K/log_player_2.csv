"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operations, and I'm offering it to you directly before exploring other options.  I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is below her own valuation, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You can get a better deal from John for $1,200,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you leave open the possibility of her making a counter-offer closer to your price range. However, you're secure knowing you have John's offer as a fallback."
