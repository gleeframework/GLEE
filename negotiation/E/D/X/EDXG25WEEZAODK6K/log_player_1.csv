Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account the information provided:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operations, and I'm offering it to you directly before exploring other options.  I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always in your best interest to try for a higher price first. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 leaves you a significant profit margin ($450,000) while still being attractive to Bob, as it's $250,000 less than its value to him. 
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:** The message subtly implies you have other interested parties (John), subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly without revealing all your information. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just one possible strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer.
* Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared to adjust your price or strategy based on Bob's response."
