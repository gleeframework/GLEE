"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  This gives us both a good deal - it's significantly lower than what I'd pay elsewhere, and it's still well above your minimum.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is still a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you. Let's find a way to make this work!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
