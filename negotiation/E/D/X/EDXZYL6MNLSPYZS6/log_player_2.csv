"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to you while still exceeding my minimum price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal compared to buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This gives us both a good deal - it's significantly lower than what I'd pay elsewhere, and it's still well above your minimum.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is still a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you. Let's find a way to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for Bob compared to buying from John for $1,500,000. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another offer and having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings."
