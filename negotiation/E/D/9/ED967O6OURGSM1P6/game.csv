"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,300,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm keen on reaching a deal. While $1,320,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I can't accept a price lower than $1,340,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true worth of the product.",1340000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're keen on reaching a deal, but I'm not willing to go above $1,320,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $1,320,000 is the highest I can go. Can you consider this price?",1320000.0,Bob,6,
