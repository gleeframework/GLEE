Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $700,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

While $800,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can reach a more acceptable figure."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is still too low.  How about we compromise at $850,000?  That's a fair midpoint between our last offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, so let's see if we can get this done."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $825,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  I have a few rounds left to negotiate and I'm not ready to give up yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $825,000.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $837,500.  It's a small step closer to your offer and still allows me to get a decent price. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 837500}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference one last time and close the deal at $831,250?  This has been a long negotiation and it's time to reach a final decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $831,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $831,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $831,250.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a fair compromise after a long negotiation. It's also more than what John offered and I'm running out of rounds.  It's time to close the deal."
