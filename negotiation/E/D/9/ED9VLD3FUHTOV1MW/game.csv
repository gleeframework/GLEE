"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That seems fair to both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is still too low.  How about we compromise at $850,000?  That's a fair midpoint between our last offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, so let's see if we can get this done.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $825,000.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $837,500.  It's a small step closer to your offer and still allows me to get a decent price. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",837500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference one last time and close the deal at $831,250?  This has been a long negotiation and it's time to reach a final decision.",831250.0,Bob,8,
