"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really struggling to see how I can justify a price above $800000. I'm willing to meet you at $800000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm not comfortable going any higher. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800000.",800000.0,Bob,10,
