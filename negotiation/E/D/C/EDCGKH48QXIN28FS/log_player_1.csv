{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm willing to go lower, but I want to start high to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I will counteroffer and try to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still allow me a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $950,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I will counteroffer again. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore options to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $975,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $975,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $960,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his latest offer of $960,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've negotiated as much as I can with Bob, and it's not worth risking a further loss in profits by continuing to negotiate.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which is a much better outcome for me."
