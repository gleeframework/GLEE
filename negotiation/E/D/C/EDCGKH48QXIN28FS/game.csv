"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still allow me a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $975,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
