Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring I get a significantly higher price than John's offer.
* **Confident but not Greedy:** The message aims to convey value and confidence without seeming overly aggressive or greedy."
