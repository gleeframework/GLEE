"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $9,000 for the product. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price, but I'm open to negotiations.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This feels like a fair price considering its value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $8,500. I believe this price still represents a good value for you, considering the product's worth to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $7,500. This is the highest I can go at this time.",7500.0,Bob,4,
