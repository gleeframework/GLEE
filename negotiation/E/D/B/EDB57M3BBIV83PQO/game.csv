"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price point. How about we settle at $950,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is a compromise from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000.",980000.0,Alice,5,
