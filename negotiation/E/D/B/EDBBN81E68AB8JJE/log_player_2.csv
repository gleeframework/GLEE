"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can agree on. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to get a better price than $1,100,000 since you can get it for $1,000,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

Alice is coming down on price but it's still higher than what you can get from John.  Let's see if we can get closer to the target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to where I need to be. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're both pretty close to a deal.  How about we split the difference? I'll drop my price to $1,070,000, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer, and I hope you'll accept it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to the price you're willing to pay, but it's still more than you can get from John.  Since we are in round 5, there is a good chance that if we continue negotiating, Alice will not come down to your desired price.  Therefore, you should buy the product from John for a lower price."
