"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you say?",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to where I need to be. What do you think?",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're both pretty close to a deal.  How about we split the difference? I'll drop my price to $1,070,000, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer, and I hope you'll accept it.",1070000.0,Alice,5,
