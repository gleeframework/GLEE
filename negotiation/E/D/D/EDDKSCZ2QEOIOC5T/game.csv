"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",90.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $90 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $82.50. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $80. This is my final offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $80 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $81. This is my last chance to negotiate, so I hope you'll consider it.",81.0,Alice,5,
