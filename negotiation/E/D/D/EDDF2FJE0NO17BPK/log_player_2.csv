"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  While I can't disclose all the details just yet, let's just say it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a significant discount from its true worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1200000 is simply too low for me to accept at this point. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need something closer to my initial offer to make this worthwhile. How about $1400000? This would still represent a significant discount from the product's true value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
