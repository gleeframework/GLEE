Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is a bit less than the midpoint between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation but aiming for a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $15,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $13,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
