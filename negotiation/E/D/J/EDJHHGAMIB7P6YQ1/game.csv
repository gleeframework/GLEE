"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you and my minimum asking price.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still allows me to make a profit and hopefully meets you halfway. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $1,200,000, so my counteroffer is $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 still falls short of my minimum.  I'm ready to make a final concession. I'll accept $1,375,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and provides a fair deal for both of us.  It's my final offer.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
