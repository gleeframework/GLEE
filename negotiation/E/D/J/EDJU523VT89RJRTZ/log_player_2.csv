"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better.  You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is willing to sell for as low as $120. This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially get a lower price from her or try to bargain with John."
