"Hello Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it's worth at least $150.  I'm willing to start with a price of $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $125? This is a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $125. How about $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $90 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $107.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's much closer to my desired value.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure if $107.50 is the best deal for me. How about $95?,95.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I'm getting close to my bottom line. How about $100? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal for a product like this.  Let's close this deal.",100.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $100. How about $92.50?",92.5,Bob,8,
