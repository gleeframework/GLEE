"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  While Alice is motivated to sell, she's still asking for more than she needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering your value and my budget.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $1,300,000 is a good price for him, given his budget of $1,500,000, and it's likely that Alice won't go lower.  It's a win-win situation for both parties."
