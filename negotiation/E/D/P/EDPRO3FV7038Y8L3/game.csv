"Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to show good faith. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen!",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,175,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I recognize the value of this product.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
