"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $80 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $90 to make this work. This still leaves a good profit margin for me, and it's a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's close this deal!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. I'm trying to be fair, but I really need to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
