"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm asking $100 for it.  It's worth a lot more to you, and it would be a great addition to your collection."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to appeal to Bob's self-interest by highlighting the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price of $80. While I could sell to John for that price, I'm hoping to get closer to the product's value for Bob in further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $80 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $90 to make this work. This still leaves a good profit margin for me, and it's a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. I'm trying to be fair, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum of $80,  it's important to consider the following:

* **Time is valuable:** We're already in round 4, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Meeting halfway:** Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, moving from $80 to $85. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  A good relationship with Bob could lead to future sales where I can potentially get a better price. 

While I'm not getting my ideal price, $85 is a reasonable compromise that allows me to secure a sale and move forward."
