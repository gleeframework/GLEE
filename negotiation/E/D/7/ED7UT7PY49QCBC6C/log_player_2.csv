"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate! Alice's offer is quite high. We have room to haggle and try to get a price closer to her value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer significantly lowers the price, aiming for a point closer to the middle ground between Alice's value ($8,000) and our maximum ($12,000).  It also leaves us some room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I value the product at a higher price point. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we're not there yet.  We can still try to negotiate a little further down before accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle on $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

We're splitting the difference here.  This keeps us in the negotiation while still pushing for a better price. Alice might be willing to accept to avoid going back and forth again."
