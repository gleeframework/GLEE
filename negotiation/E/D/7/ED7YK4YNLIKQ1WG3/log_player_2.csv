"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Since the product is worth no more than $150 to Bob, and Alice is offering it at exactly that price, accepting the offer is the optimal choice. It allows Bob to buy the product at his maximum value and avoid potentially waiting or searching for a better deal."
