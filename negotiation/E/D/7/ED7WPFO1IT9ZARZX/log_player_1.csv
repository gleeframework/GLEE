Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Would you consider this offer?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but unfortunately, my maximum budget remains at $10,000. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John."
