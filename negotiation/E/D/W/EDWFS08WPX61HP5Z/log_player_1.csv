Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price.  I'll be watching Bob's response and be ready to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $14,000 is closer to my minimum value, but I think I can still do better.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500.  This is a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $14,200. While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's clear that Bob is not willing to go much higher.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially lowering the price even further."
