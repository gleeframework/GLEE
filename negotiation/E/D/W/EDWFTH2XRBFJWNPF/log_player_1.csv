Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've made a serious offer of $1,250,000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $800,000.

While I'd prefer to get $1,300,000, Bob is firm on his price and threatening to go with a competitor (even if it's a bluff). Accepting his offer of $1,250,000 is still a significant profit over John's offer."
