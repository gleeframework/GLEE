"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. That's the highest I can go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is close, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 for this to make sense. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've made a serious offer of $1,250,000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $800,000.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
