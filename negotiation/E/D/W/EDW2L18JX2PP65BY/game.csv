"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $10,500. Can you consider $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
