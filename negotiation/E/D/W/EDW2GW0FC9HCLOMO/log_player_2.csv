You have three options:

Round 2

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is low, but $90 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $70? That would be a fair compromise."",

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some middle ground. How about $80? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
At this point, Alice's offer matches John's price, so it's best to accept and avoid potentially missing out on the product.  There's no guarantee Alice will go lower in future rounds."
