"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is low, but $90 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $70? That would be a fair compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,
