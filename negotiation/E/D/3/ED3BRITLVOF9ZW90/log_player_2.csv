It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can potentially save $1,000 by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to budge. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price than $999,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer again.  While it's a better price than her initial offer, I'm still confident I can get a lower price.  I'll try a counteroffer closer to my initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 960000}

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $960,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating, but also that I'm willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's better to accept Alice's offer.  While I'd love to get a lower price, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  Saving $35,000 compared to buying from John is a good deal, and it's worth closing the deal."
