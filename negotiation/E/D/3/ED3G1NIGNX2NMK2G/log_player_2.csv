"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as you value the product at $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000, which is less than what John would charge ($1,500,000).
* **You still get a good deal:** While Alice's price is more than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000), it's less than your maximum budget ($1,500,000). This means you save money compared to buying from John."
