I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a fair price that leaves room for negotiation, but still ensures I make a significant profit.  I believe Bob will see the value in this offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly above his counteroffer. I believe this price is reasonable considering the value of the product to Bob."
