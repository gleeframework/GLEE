"I'm really interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $12,000 undervalues the product's true worth and capabilities.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. I believe this reflects the value you'll gain.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $19,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $14,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,4,
