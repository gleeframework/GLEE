Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I've already compromised a lot by offering $82 earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $79. It's a fair price, and I think you'll still get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price, and it will likely take several more rounds to get below $79.  At this point, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk that Alice won't budge further and you'll end up paying John's $100 price. $79 is a reasonable compromise."
