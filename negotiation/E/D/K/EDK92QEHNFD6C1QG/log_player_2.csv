"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a great deal for both of us - it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and I'll still be making a good profit. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You're getting the product for $9,500 from Alice, whereas John would charge you $10,000. 
* **You still save money.**  Even though Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation of the product, you're still getting a good deal because the product is worth $10,000 to you."
