Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 gives you room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, framing it as a worthwhile investment for Bob.
* **Exclusivity:**  The use of ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of urgency and desirability, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always lower the price, but you can't go higher once the offer is made."
