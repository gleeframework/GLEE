Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it, reflecting its true value and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Opening Offer:** Starting with a high price sets a strong baseline and allows for more negotiation room. 
* **Emphasize Value:** Highlighting the potential benefits to Bob can make him more likely to consider a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for negotiation, showing that you're willing to discuss the price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations. 
* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** I will be prepared to counter Bob's offers strategically, aiming to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open.
* **Consider John's Offer:** I will always keep John's $800,000 offer in mind as a safety net. If the negotiation with Bob becomes too lengthy or unproductive, I can always sell to John and ensure a minimum return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer and see the potential in this product. However, $1000000 is a bit outside my budget at the moment. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which reflects my current valuation.  Let me know if that's a number we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Room for Higher Offers:**  While I could try to negotiate a higher price, it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and uncertain, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to another buyer. 

**Conclusion:**

 Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice. It ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids the risk and time commitment of further negotiation."
