"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to sell at $9,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still not quite there with $11,000.  Let's try $9,500.  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000, which is $10,250. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
