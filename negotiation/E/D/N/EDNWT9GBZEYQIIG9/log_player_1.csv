Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $10,000 is higher than $8,000, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** $10,000 is still above your minimum of $12,000, so you're not losing money.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** The message is direct and friendly, leaving room for Bob to respond.

It's important to remember that this is just the first step in negotiation.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $12,000. Accepting this would result in a substantial loss.
* **I have a better alternative:** John is willing to pay $12,000, which is my desired price. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** While $8,000 is unacceptable, I can still counteroffer and try to reach a compromise.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the possibility of securing a higher price, either by negotiating with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is above Bob's offer but below my minimum:**  $9,000 is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Message shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate:** The message acknowledges Bob's perspective and expresses a willingness to work towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Focus on the value of the product:** I highlight the product's worth to justify my counteroffer.

This counteroffer positions me to potentially reach a deal with Bob while still protecting my interests and minimizing my potential loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:** $8,500 is still far from my desired price of $12,000, and significantly below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Time is a factor:** We've been negotiating for a while, and it's clear that Bob isn't willing to meet my price. 
* **A guaranteed alternative exists:** John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my desired price.

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $12,000, selling to John ensures I don't lose money and can secure my desired value.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point, as the chances of reaching an agreeable price are slim."
