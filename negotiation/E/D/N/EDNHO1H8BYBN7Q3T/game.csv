"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, but $800,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. How about we settle at $950,000? ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
