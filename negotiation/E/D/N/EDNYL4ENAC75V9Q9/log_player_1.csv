This offer starts high, reflecting the product's worth to me. However, it's important to leave room for negotiation, as I'm not certain about Bob's valuation. This approach allows me to gauge his interest and potential counteroffers, while still aiming for a good profit."

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but I can still push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a compromise that is closer to my desired price point."

I'm lowering my price a bit, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,350,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer, making it a good middle ground. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while maintaining my profit margins."
