"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm eager to make this deal, $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This would still be a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's find a way to make this work!",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,500 is still a little out of my range. I'm willing to pay $15,500. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",15500.0,Bob,4,
