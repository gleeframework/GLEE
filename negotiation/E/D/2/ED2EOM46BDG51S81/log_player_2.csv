# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $975,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice keeps offering prices higher than my budget.  I've made multiple counteroffers, and we are not making significant progress.  It's clear we are far apart, and I'm risking further time and negotiation without a guarantee of success.  At this point, it's best to cut my losses and secure the product from John at the agreed-upon price of $800,000."
