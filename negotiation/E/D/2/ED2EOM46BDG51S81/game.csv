"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits the product can bring to your business. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the compromise, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000 for this product, as it truly does hold value for my business. This is a fair offer, reflecting both our needs. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're making progress, but $1,025,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $975,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's reach a deal!",975000.0,Bob,6,
