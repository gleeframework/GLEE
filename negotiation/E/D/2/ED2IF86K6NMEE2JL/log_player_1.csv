"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $95 is a bit steep for me.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $85, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $90?  I think that's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $88.  It's better than selling to John for $80 and getting closer to my desired price."
