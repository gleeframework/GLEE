"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $700000 is still a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $650000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $675000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer of $650000.",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However,  $675000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  I'm willing to pay $660000, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach a final agreement.",660000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We're getting close, but we're still not quite there. We're willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $670000. This is our final offer, and we believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and your previous offers.",670000.0,Alice,5,
