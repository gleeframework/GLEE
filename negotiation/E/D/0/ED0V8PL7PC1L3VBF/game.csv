"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1100000. This is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  The product sounds great, but  $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1100000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $1050000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1050000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1000000, which is a fair price for both of us. It's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1025000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.
