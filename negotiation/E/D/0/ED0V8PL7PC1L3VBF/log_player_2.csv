"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1100000. This is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. You can start by making a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  The product sounds great, but  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer starts strong, making a significant reduction from Alice's price. This shows you're serious about negotiating and sets the stage for a back-and-forth.
* **Room for compromise:**  The offer is still below your maximum budget, leaving room for Alice to counter without exceeding your limit.
* **Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, focusing on the product's value and suggesting a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1100000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $1050000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, but you can still do better.  You're close to John's offer, and there's a good chance you can push Alice further down with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us. It's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** This counteroffer clearly states it's your final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Meeting John's price:** This offer matches John's price, demonstrating your willingness to walk away if necessary.
* **Fairness:**  The message emphasizes fairness, highlighting that the offer is mutually beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1025000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum budget.  You are now at the point where it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed price from John than to continue negotiating with Alice. 

There's no guarantee Alice will accept your next counteroffer, and it risks you spending more time and energy without achieving a better outcome."
