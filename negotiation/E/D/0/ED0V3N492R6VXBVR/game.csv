"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm sure this is a great product, but my budget is around $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. It's a great compromise, considering the value it brings to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $13,500 is still a little out of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $13,250. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value it brings.",13250.0,Alice,5,
