"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price. You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice's product is only worth $80 to her. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:** $100 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for compromise.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and maintains a positive tone, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation. 
* **Highlight your interest:**  Mentioning your interest in the product shows that you're not just trying to lowball her, but genuinely want to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice's offer of $110 is a reasonable compromise, meeting you halfway.  
* **Saving money:** You're still saving $40 compared to buying from John. 
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 10 rounds, continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price."
