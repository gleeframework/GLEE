"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that reflects its potential. My asking price is $1,200,000. This gives you a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
