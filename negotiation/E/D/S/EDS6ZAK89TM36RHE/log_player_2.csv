"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that reflects its potential. My asking price is $1,200,000. This gives you a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly lower than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you money."
