"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I've researched your needs and I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $950,000. I think you'll agree this is a fair price considering the return you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than your alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay that much and open the door for a potential counter-offer at a lower price."
