"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too high to scare him off immediately. This allows for room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking for something within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $90 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident I can convince him to pay a bit more, especially since he expressed interest and acknowledged the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to offer $92 for your product, hoping we can reach an agreement within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $92 is within my acceptable range and a good deal considering the limited rounds.  It's better than selling to John for $100, and I'm still making a decent profit."
