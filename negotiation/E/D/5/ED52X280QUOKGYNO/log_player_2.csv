**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is closer to my budget, but it's still $10 above my preferred price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, especially since we're getting closer to the middle ground. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is just $10 away from my ideal price and is a compromise from the previous rounds. Since we're nearing the end of the rounds, I'm raising my offer a bit to hopefully get a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go above my budget."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $5 above my budget. While I'm very close to a deal with Alice, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not comfortable with. Buying from John guarantees me the product at my maximum budget, so it's the safer and more predictable option at this point."
