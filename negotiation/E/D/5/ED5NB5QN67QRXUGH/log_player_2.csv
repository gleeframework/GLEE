Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $155 is still a bit out of my price range. If you're willing to come down to $145, I'm happy to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'm going to have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go below $155, Bob. However, I'm willing to sweeten the deal for you. If you're willing to commit to the purchase today, I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth $20. So, the total price would be $155 for the product and $20 for the accessory, making it a total of $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer, even with the free accessory, is still above my $120 limit.  I've reached the point where I'm more comfortable buying from John. It's clear Alice is unwilling to come down further in price, and I don't want to risk continuing the negotiation and losing the opportunity to buy from John."
