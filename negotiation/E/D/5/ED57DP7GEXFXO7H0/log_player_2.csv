"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you, Bob! I'm willing to sell this amazing product to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $110 is less than the maximum Bob is willing to pay, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to save as much as possible.  Offering $95 is a significant drop from Alice's initial $110. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  $95 is still above Alice's $80 valuation, leaving room for a compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Fairness:**  While $95 is closer to Bob's maximum, it avoids being overly aggressive and risks losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice's offer of $105 is a significant decrease from her initial $110 and is closer to Bob's counteroffer of $95. This indicates a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Price:** $105 is still within Bob's budget of $120 and represents a good saving compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, potentially forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at a price that is both advantageous to him and allows Alice to make a profit."
