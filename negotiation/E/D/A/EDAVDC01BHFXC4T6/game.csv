"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to make a good profit.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,075,000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  I think this is a fair compromise and will allow us to both walk away happy.  Let's make this deal.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,060,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $1,070,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1070000.0,Alice,5,
