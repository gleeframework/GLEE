# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price. You can save at least $100,000 compared to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,075,000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us. What do you think?

It's still worth trying to get a lower price.  Alice has already moved closer to your desired price.  You can try to get closer to $1,050,000."

# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,060,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $1,070,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

It's likely that Alice won't go lower. Accepting her offer allows you to buy the product for $1,070,000, which is significantly lower than buying from John for $1,200,000. You've saved $130,000."
