Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. However, I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a price that could work for both of us."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows Bob values the product less than she does.  Starting with a price of $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while anchoring the value high in Bob's mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording ""initially proposing"" and ""open to hearing your thoughts"" signals to Bob that Alice is willing to negotiate.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a backup plan with John. This gives her leverage and allows her to be firm in getting a price closer to her minimum. 

**Important Note:** While Alice knows John will buy the product for $12,000, she shouldn't reveal this information to Bob."
