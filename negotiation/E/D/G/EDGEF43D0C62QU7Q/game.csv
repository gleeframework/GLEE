"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its market value. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective on the market value, this product offers unique advantages that justify a premium price.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I believe this is a fair offer considering its true potential.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $2,000,000 is still far above what I'm comfortable paying.  To be frank, anything over $1,100,000 and I'm better off exploring other options. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000 if you're serious about selling.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
