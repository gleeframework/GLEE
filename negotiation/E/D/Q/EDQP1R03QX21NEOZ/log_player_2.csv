"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a sacrifice to get it to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which aligns with his maximum budget.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best financial decision for Bob."
