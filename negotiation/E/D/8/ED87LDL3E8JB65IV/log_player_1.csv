"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still less than what I'd get from John.  This leaves room for negotiation and encourages Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, I'm not going to accept it.  It's significantly less than my minimum value, and I have room to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter with $115. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable price for him while still leaving me some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $120.  I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $110.  This is a further compromise, and I believe it's a reasonable price given the previous offers.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm running out of rounds.  It's more likely Bob will keep lowering his offers, and I'm not sure if I'll reach my desired price. I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for $120."
