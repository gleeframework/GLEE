"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""incredible value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing my own minimum. 
* **Leaving Room:** Even if Bob finds this initial price unrealistic, it gives us a starting point from which we can work towards a mutually agreeable price over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your initial offer is quite high.  I'm willing to start the negotiation at $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his perceived value. While his counter was expected, accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  Selling to John at this stage would be taking the guaranteed profit too early – I still have room to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging the Counter:** Showing I've considered Bob's offer helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Firm but Flexible:** While I've decreased my asking price considerably, it's still well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This signals that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a major loss.
* **Market Value:**  By mentioning ""market value,"" I'm subtly anchoring the negotiation around a higher price point without explicitly revealing my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has a high market value, but I'm aiming for a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered his perceived value of the product. This is a positive sign, indicating he's serious about the purchase. However, I still have some negotiating power. Accepting now would mean leaving potential profit on the table. I'm willing to push a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer.  I appreciate you moving towards a fair price. To show I'm serious, let's make this happen – $1,650,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1650000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** I acknowledge Bob's movement and use phrases like ""getting closer"" and ""fair price"" to encourage further concessions.
* **Significant Drop:** I've made a considerable drop from my previous offer, signaling a willingness to compromise, but it's still comfortably above my minimum and leaves room for a final small concession from Bob.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By framing it as ""let's make this happen,"" I'm introducing a subtle sense of urgency, subtly implying this is my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, I need the price to be closer to my budget.  Would you consider $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a significant profit over my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  We've reached a point where further haggling might yield minimal returns. Bob has consistently increased his offer, showing genuine interest. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation for a potentially small increase in profit isn't worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.  Securing the profit now is a good business decision."
