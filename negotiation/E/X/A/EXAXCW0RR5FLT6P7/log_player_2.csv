"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent price, it's still above your maximum budget of $120.  You have room to negotiate and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $108. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is within your budget and represents a good compromise.  You're able to save $2 compared to John's offer, making this a favorable outcome.  Further negotiation might save you a few more dollars, but the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and losing the opportunity entirely is too high.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product within your budget."
