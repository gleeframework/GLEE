"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm willing to walk away if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer to try to get a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $1,500,000 before I need to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is still above Bob's perceived value but closer to my minimum price.  It shows I'm serious about selling but also leaves room for some further negotiation."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not going to settle yet. I want to see if I can get a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is still above my minimum price but closer to Bob's last offer. I'm hoping to get a deal done at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my goal.  If he rejects this, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm dropping my price to $1,100,000, which is still above my minimum, but I'm not willing to go any lower. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be selling to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, but I've made it clear I won't go any lower than $1,100,000. With only two rounds left, I don't have enough time to push him further.  It's time to take John's offer and secure my minimum price."
