Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's still above your minimum value of $12,000, allowing you to potentially get a better price.
* **It's clear and concise:**  This message is straightforward and easy for Bob to understand. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation with a reasonable offer that could lead to a mutually beneficial deal."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to accept it or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's initial offer, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. There's still a chance Bob might be willing to go higher, and selling to John is always an option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest,  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us and reflects the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept it or if you'd like to make another counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $9,250, which is closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of going back and forth with Bob and potentially getting a lower price is high.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a profit and ensures I meet my minimum value.  It's time to move on."
