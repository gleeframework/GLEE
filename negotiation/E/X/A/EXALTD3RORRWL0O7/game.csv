"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Let's try a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but  $8,200 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,600?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8600.0,Alice,5,
