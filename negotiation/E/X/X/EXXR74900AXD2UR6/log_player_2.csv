"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think you'll really love it! As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $8,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential interest in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can likely get a better price than $8,000. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $8,000 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it, given my budget and the market value I've researched.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $9,500. Considering the product's value and the initial offer I made, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $9,750. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved closer to your price, and you're within your budget.  Accepting her offer saves you $2,250 compared to buying from John."
