"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to sell the product, I need to make at least $120 to justify the sale. I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit more, but if we can't reach a better price, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $80 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $85, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, $85 is still below what I need. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but if we can't reach a price I'm comfortable with, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $90.  I'm willing to come down to $88. This is my final offer,  let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 88} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $88 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $82.50, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, we're getting further apart in our valuations.  I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John for $120, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity. It's time to cut my losses and secure the higher price with John."
