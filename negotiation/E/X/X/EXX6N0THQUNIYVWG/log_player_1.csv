Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully earn a good profit. I'm also aware that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent price, I can likely do better.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a lower offer than my original price, but still higher than what Bob offered. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price and it seems he's not willing to go any higher. I'm happy to accept $860,000 for the product."
