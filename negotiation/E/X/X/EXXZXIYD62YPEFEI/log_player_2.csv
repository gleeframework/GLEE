# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $12000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $12,000 for the product, which is what I'm willing to spend. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
