"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,750,000. This is a great deal for you as the product is worth $800,000 to you, so you'd be getting a significant return on your investment. If you decide not to purchase it, I have another buyer ready to pay $1,500,000, so I'm not in a rush to sell. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
