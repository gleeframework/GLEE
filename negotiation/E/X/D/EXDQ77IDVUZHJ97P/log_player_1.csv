"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the product's value and appealing to Bob's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is higher than Bob's actual value for the product, it's still below my minimum price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at that price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is still below my preferred price, it's getting closer to my minimum. There's a risk that Bob might reject my next counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting $90 is a good compromise, especially since John is willing to pay $100, providing me with a safety net."
