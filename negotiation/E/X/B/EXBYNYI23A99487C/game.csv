"Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you attribute to it, but I am looking to keep the investment within my budget. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise between the product's worth and my financial capacity.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,200,000 is far below the product's true value and what I need to achieve.  I'm willing to be flexible and meet you halfway.  My counteroffer is $1,600,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit, but also allows me to reach my target. I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider, but I need to make sure I can achieve a fair return on this product.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time.  My final counteroffer is $1,450,000. This price is a compromise that allows both of us to benefit. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
