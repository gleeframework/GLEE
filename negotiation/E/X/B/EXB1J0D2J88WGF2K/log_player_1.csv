Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and still allows me to make a significant profit. I'm confident that the product is worth it to Bob, and he'll be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to $1,500,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,450,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about selling to him, but I'm still holding out for a good profit.  It's a compromise, but it should encourage Bob to come up a bit higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my desired price and at this point, there's a chance he won't increase it further.  I'm willing to take the $1,425,000 to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential for a lower price."
