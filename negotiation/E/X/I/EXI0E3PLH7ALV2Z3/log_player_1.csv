Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $120 to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $145 is a starting point that is still above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's worth to Bob ($120) emphasizes the potential benefit for him.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while still securing a profit for Alice. 
* **Option to Sell to John:** Alice always has the option to sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Alice wants to maximize profit, and $130 is still below her minimum of $150.
* **Negotiation Space:** Rejecting allows Alice to maintain control and continue negotiating towards a higher price.
* **John as Safety Net:** Having John as an option provides Alice with a fallback if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $130 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $140?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $140 is still above Alice's minimum price of $150, ensuring profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a positive tone (""good deal,"" ""closer to a deal"") keeps the negotiation amicable and encourages Bob to continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $135 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit vs. Time:** While $135 is closer to Alice's minimum, it still falls short of her desired profit margin.  
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to pay $150, guaranteeing Alice her desired profit.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Selling to John avoids further negotiation rounds with Bob, saving time and effort. 

Alice has a guaranteed buyer in John, and continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John's offer and potentially settling for a lower price than she could get elsewhere."
