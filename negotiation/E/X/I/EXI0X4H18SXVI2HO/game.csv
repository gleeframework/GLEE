,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm interested in buying, but I'm only willing to go up to $85. Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a little high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $95.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
