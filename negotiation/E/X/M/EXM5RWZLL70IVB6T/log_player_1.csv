"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $60 is too low for me.  Could you do $100 for it? "",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's valuable, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While I could try to push for a bit more, Bob has landed at his maximum valuation. Accepting $80 is better than continuing to negotiate and risking him walking away, leaving me to sell to John for $100."
