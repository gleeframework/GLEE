Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in your product but I'm only willing to pay $10000 at this point. Let's see if we can find some common ground.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $10,000 is way too low for me. I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob, and I have 8 more rounds to try."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $17,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $17000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for now.  I have 6 rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is still too low for me, but I'm open to finding a middle ground. Let's try $15,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $15500 is still a bit too high for me. However, I'm eager to finalize this deal. I'm willing to go up to $14000. This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close this deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I would have preferred to get more from Bob, it's clear that we're not going to agree on a price that works for both of us. John is a guaranteed sale at a price that is above my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on this opportunity by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
