# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's a good idea to reject it and start negotiating. You can try a counteroffer significantly lower than $20,000 to see if she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in your product but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. It's a starting point, and we'll see if Alice is open to discussing a lower price. If she's not, we can adjust our counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $17000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since you have time and a fallback option in John.  A counteroffer closer to your target price will show your serious interest while still maintaining leverage."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're moving closer to your budget. This counteroffer shows your seriousness about buying the product while staying within your desired range.  It's a significant increase from your previous offer, indicating flexibility, but still below Alice's price.  We'll see if she's willing to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13000 is still too low for me, but I'm open to finding a middle ground. Let's try $15500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still above your ideal price. It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since you have John as a backup option. You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer closer to your target of $12,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. However, I'm eager to finalize this deal. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step closer to your budget, and it still leaves room for Alice to come down a little. It's a good compromise that shows your serious interest while staying within your budget. We'll see if Alice is ready to close the deal."
