"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a good offer, it doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  However, $920,000 still falls short of my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our needs.",940000.0,Alice,5,
