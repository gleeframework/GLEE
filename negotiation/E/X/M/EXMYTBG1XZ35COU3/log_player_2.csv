"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great opportunity for you! I'm willing to sell you this amazing product for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob than buying from John.**  Bob is willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering it for $120. This saves Bob $30.
* **Even though Bob values the product at $150, he can still make a profit by buying from Alice and reselling it to someone else.**
* **The offer is within Bob's budget.** 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice for Bob."
