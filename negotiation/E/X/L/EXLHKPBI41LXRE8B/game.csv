"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, $725,000 is still below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
