"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a great deal for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Can we try $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I value your willingness to compromise, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to come down slightly further, but let's aim for $10,000. This price is still fair for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, and I understand you're reaching your limit. While $9,800 is still a bit too low for me, I'm willing to make one final concession to reach an agreement.  I'll accept $9,900, which is a good compromise for both of us. This price allows me to cover my costs and lets you acquire a product you'll value highly. Let me know if this works for you!",9900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,700, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",9700.0,Bob,8,
