"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This represents a significant value proposition for you, as you've indicated the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  If you're not interested at this price, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm confident you'll see the potential value in this opportunity.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
