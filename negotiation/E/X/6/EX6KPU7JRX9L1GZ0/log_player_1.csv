Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a fairly high starting price, but it allows for room to negotiate.  It also sets a clear expectation that the product is valuable. 

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **High Starting Point:**  It's better to start high and negotiate down than to start low and regret leaving money on the table. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** $15,000 gives Bob some room to make a counteroffer without you feeling like you're giving away too much.
* **Show Value:** The price reflects your belief in the product's value and might encourage Bob to seriously consider the offer.

Remember, the goal is to maximize profit, but also to be realistic about what Bob might be willing to pay. This starting point allows you to gauge Bob's interest and adjust your strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $10000 for it. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Even though selling to John means I'll get the minimum I want, it's still more than what Bob is offering.  

There's a chance I could negotiate with Bob, but it's risky. If I reject his offer and try to counter-offer, there's no guarantee he'll come back with a higher price.  Selling to John is the most secure way to get a decent price, given the information I have now."
