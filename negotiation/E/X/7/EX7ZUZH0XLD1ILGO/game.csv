"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,250.
