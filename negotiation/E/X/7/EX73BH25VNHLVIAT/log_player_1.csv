Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""incredible value and potential,"" you are subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth and justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""I believe this is a fair price"" and ""What do you think?"" signal your willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in the conversation.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while maintaining a professional and persuasive tone."
