**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is getting closer, but it's still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  We're only in round 5, so there's time to negotiate further, but I'm starting to feel like the deal might not close. To avoid further delays and ensure I get the product, I'll buy it from John for $800,000."
