Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I am willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Gain:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's potential for him to pay more than your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Negotiating Room:**  Offering a price of $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a substantial profit for you.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By highlighting this as a ""one-time offer"" and an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you add a sense of urgency and value to encourage Bob to accept.

**Alternative Strategies:**

You could potentially start with a higher offer (closer to $1,500,000) and be prepared to negotiate down. However, the current offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept."
