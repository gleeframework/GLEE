"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really keen on this product, and I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more offer: I'll sell the product to you for $105. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
