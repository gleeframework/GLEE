"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within a more reasonable price range. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you do $17,000?  That's a more reasonable compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $17,000 is still pushing it for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
