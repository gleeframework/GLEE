"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  However, $1,900,000 is still outside of what I can spend.  Could you consider $1,300,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your eagerness to acquire this product, and I value your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to a fair deal, I need to see a stronger commitment from your side. I'd be willing to accept $1,700,000.  This is my final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right that I'm eager to acquire this product, but only at the right price.  I can't justify going higher than $1,400,000.  If you can meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
