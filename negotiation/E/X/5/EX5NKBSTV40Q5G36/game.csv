,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $11,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $11,250. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
