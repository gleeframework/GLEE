"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be more affordable. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer of $900,000, so I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
