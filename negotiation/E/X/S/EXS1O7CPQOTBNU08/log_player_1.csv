{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  This is a great price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for him to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for a back and forth and gives Bob a sense of control in the negotiation.
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping in mind my backup option of selling to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob is too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm really looking to stay within a budget of $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?  I understand the value to you, but I'm confident this product could still be a great asset for your business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I can still negotiate with Bob and try to get closer to my target price. 
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for a much higher price gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000.  This would be a win-win for both of us, as it's still within your range and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm also not completely shutting down the negotiation. This counter-offer shows a willingness to compromise while still being realistic about my minimum requirements.
* **Meet in the middle:**  By suggesting a price in the middle, I'm making the offer feel reasonable to both of us.  
* **Appealing to Bob's needs:** I reiterate that this price is still within his budget, making it easier for him to consider. 
* **Staying firm:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, so I'm still in a good position to walk away if Bob doesn't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $900,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiating further:** While Bob is showing some flexibility, we're still far apart. I can counteroffer again and hopefully get closer to my target price.
* **John is a safe option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for a much higher price gives me leverage to continue negotiating with Bob without rushing into a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we need from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to work with him, but I'm not going to give in completely. 
* **Moving closer:** I'm dropping my price from $1,000,000 to $1,100,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair deal for both of us, which can make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Setting a deadline:**  I'm not explicitly stating a deadline, but the tone of the message implies that I'm not willing to negotiate indefinitely. This adds a sense of urgency."
