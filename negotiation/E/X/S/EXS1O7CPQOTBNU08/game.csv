"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm really looking to stay within a budget of $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?  I understand the value to you, but I'm confident this product could still be a great asset for your business.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000.  This would be a win-win for both of us, as it's still within your range and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $900,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we need from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
