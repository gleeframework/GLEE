# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000.  This would be a win-win for both of us, as it's still within your range and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a better offer than Alice's previous price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his goal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $900,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we need from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is closer to Bob's budget, but still above his maximum of $800,000.  At this point, it's clear that further negotiation with Alice might be lengthy and uncertain.  It's more efficient and cost-effective for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, guaranteeing the lowest price and a quick purchase."
