"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95. I'd be willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $92 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers - $93.50. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",93.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $93.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $91, but that's the absolute maximum I can afford. Would you be willing to consider that?",91.0,Bob,6,
