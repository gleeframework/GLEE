"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation and is likely to be attractive to Bob.  I'm also making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate, which may encourage Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $95, but I can't go any lower than that.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering at $95. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still gives me a good profit. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also willing to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95. I'd be willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $92 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to secure a better deal. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $92 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers - $93.50. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 93.5}
```

I'm counteroffering at $93.50.  This is a compromise that splits the difference between our last offers. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer, hoping to put pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $93.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $91, but that's the absolute maximum I can afford. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $91 is not my ideal price, it's still a good profit and I'm running out of time. I've already rejected a few offers, and I don't want to risk losing Bob completely. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the potential of having to sell to John at a lower price."
