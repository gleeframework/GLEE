"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000. There's no reason to accept this offer.  You have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Alice and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $10,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and might make her consider negotiating.  It's important to start with a low number to leave room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $15,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price, especially since I have multiple rounds remaining.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $12,000. This is a more moderate increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my budget. This approach should keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is getting closer to my maximum, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I have several rounds remaining, and I believe I can still negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open, and I can try a slightly higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's last offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good price. It's a strategic move to see if Alice will meet me in the middle or offer a lower price. We are getting closer to a possible deal, and I want to see if we can reach a compromise in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $15,500 is very close to my maximum budget, I still have a few rounds left and can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going, and I can try to push for a price closer to my desired $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer, and it's exactly my maximum budget. Since Alice has been willing to lower her price, I believe there's a good chance she will accept this final offer.  If she rejects it, I can always purchase the product from John at $15,000."
