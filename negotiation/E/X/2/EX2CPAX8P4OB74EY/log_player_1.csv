Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,500,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

While ideally, I'd want closer to my initial offer, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,300,000 ensures a significant profit without risking the deal by pushing further."
