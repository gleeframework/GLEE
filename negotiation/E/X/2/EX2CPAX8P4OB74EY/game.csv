"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low for what this product offers.  How about we settle at $1,600,000?  This reflects the true value while acknowledging your enthusiasm.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still thinking that $1,600,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'm thinking of $1,400,000. Can we meet at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I need to be firm on its value. My final offer is $1,500,000. This is a fantastic deal on a one-of-a-kind product.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,500,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
