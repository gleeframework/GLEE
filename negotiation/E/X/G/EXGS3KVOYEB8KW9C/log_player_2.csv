"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and gives me a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $850,000 isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  This would still give you a significant gain and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.
