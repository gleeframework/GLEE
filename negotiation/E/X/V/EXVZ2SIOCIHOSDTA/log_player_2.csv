"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly higher than her valuation ($10,000), it's still significantly cheaper than John's price ($15,000). This means Bob can save $1,000 by accepting Alice's offer."
