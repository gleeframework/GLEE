"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's unique and high-quality, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  I'm asking $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we settle on $9000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to still get a great deal on a valuable product while ensuring I receive a fair price for my investment. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. How about we settle on $8500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
