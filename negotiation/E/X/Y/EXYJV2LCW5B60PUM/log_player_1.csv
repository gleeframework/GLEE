Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the potential I see for you, I'm willing to offer it at $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, your goal is to maximize your profit.  
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting with a price of $12,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also anchors the price point higher in his mind. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the safety net of John who will pay your minimum acceptable price. This allows you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob might outright reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk and the potential for a higher reward."
