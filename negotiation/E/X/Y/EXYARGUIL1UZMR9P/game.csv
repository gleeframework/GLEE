"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I recognize the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but $700,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum. How about $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
