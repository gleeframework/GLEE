"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $11,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,200. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you've made concessions, and I appreciate that.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,200.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,100?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale.",11100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11,100. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,150. This is the last compromise I'm willing to make.",1150.0,Alice,7,
