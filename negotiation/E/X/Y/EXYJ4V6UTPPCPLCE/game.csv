"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is significantly below its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This is my final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget constraints remain. I am unable to accept $1,700,000. My latest counteroffer is $1,600,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
