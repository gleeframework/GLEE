"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to pay a lower price, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10000.

What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable paying $10200. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10200 to $10000, but I can only go up to $10000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. My final offer is $10000.",10000.0,Bob,6,
