"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price.  You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm going to need to come in a bit lower than that. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for you. You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so you're getting it for a price significantly below its value to her.  While you might be able to squeeze out an even lower price, it's likely not worth the risk of losing the deal, especially considering John is selling the same product for $1,500,000."
