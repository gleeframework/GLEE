Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the initial price I offered reflects the true worth and potential this product holds for your business. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be honest,  $1,025,000 is still a significant investment for me.  To make this work, I'd need to see the price closer to $900,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I've tried to reflect that in my previous offers. While $900,000 is a significant jump, I'm ready to close this deal. I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

This is a tough one. Alice is calling this her final offer, which increases the risk of her walking away. However, we're still a good bit away from our ideal price. Let's counter one more time, but be prepared to either accept her next offer or walk away."
