"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the initial price I offered reflects the true worth and potential this product holds for your business. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I believe this revised offer represents a significant value proposition for you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be honest,  $1,025,000 is still a significant investment for me.  To make this work, I'd need to see the price closer to $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I've tried to reflect that in my previous offers. While $900,000 is a significant jump, I'm ready to close this deal. I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm also keen to close this deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $937,500?  This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",937500.0,Bob,6,
