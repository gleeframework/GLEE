Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not excessively so. I'm hoping this will give me some room to negotiate, but also entice Bob to accept the offer without too much haggling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and get a quick sale, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer at $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to the product's value to him. I believe this price is fair and will hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price. I'll counter again, but I'm getting closer to John's offer and might have to accept it if Bob doesn't come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous counteroffer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to John's price. This is a final attempt to get a better price from Bob, and if he rejects, I'll likely move forward with John to avoid further delays."
