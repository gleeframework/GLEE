"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my spending within $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,000 for the product?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $13,000? This still gives you a great price, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go above $12,000. Could you possibly meet me halfway at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop to $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
