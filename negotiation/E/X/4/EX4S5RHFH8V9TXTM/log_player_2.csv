# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a fantastic deal at $175. I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer of $175 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100 and John's offer of $100. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer."
