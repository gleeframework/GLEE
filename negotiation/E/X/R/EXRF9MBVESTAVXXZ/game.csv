"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to make a compromise. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit out of my range. I'm firm on my offer of $120. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,
