Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it also reflects the high value I place on the product.  I'm confident I can get at least $1,000,000 from John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is still a good price for me, as it's well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair compromise and accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not high enough.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I want to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000 before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,100,000. This is a further compromise, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will finally see the value of the product and accept my offer. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is finally above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, it's not worth risking further negotiations and potentially losing the deal entirely."
