Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is your final attempt to negotiate with Alice. You're offering slightly more than your preferred price from John, hoping to incentivize Alice to accept.  This offer is a good compromise: it's higher than your ideal price but still significantly lower than Alice's previous offer. It signals that you're serious about buying the product, but you're unwilling to go much higher.  If Alice rejects this offer, you'll be ready to buy from John for $1,000,000."
