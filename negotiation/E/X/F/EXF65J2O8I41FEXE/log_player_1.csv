Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above your minimum value:** You want at least $80, so $100 is a good starting point.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $120, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **Is a fair price:** It's a compromise between your value and Bob's value. 

This strategy allows you to maximize your profits while still being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer of $90 is still above your minimum value of $80 and a reasonable compromise. Accepting his offer will guarantee you a sale and a profit.  It's better to secure a good price now than risk a longer negotiation or having to sell to John at a lower price."
