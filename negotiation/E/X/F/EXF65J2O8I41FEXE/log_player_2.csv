"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for a lower price than $100, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
