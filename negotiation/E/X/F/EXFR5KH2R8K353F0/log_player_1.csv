"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves me with a decent profit. I believe it's a fair starting point that encourages Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'll counter-offer and see if I can close the deal closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm increasing my offer to $950,000. This is a small compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also reminding him that I won't settle for much less than my desired price."

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. It's getting closer to my desired price, but I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, we're running out of rounds. I'm not confident I can get a better price, and selling to John will ensure I get my minimum value.  It's time to move on to a guaranteed deal."
