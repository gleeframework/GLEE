"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $10500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer.  ",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10200. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Alice,5,
