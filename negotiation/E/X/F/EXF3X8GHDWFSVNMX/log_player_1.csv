Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider that?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,700 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Bob is very slowly inching up his offer. While we might get a bit more out of him, it's getting risky. Taking the $8,700 is better than potentially getting stuck with only getting $8,000 from John if negotiations completely stall."
