"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing terms further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is still significantly below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd like to propose $1,550,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
