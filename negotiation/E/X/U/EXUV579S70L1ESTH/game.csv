"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $13,000 is already a competitive price considering the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,500.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,750 is close, but I have to be firm on my end. I can do $11,000 and that's my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
