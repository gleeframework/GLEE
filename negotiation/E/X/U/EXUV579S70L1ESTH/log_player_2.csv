"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $13,000 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is better than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation and potentially a much better price.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts a strong negotiation.  It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  $10,000 is still above Alice's value, so there's room for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $13,000 is already a competitive price considering the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer, but $11,500 is still too high.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better price by pushing a bit more. The goal is to get the price as close to $10,000 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,500.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward. By splitting the difference, Bob shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to his desired target. $10,750 is still a good deal for Alice, as it's well above her value of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,750 is close, but I have to be firm on my end. I can do $11,000 and that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made her ""final offer"" at $11,000.  While it's not Bob's ideal price, it's still a good deal compared to John's $15,000 price.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal with Alice, and there's no guarantee John will be willing to negotiate his price.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
