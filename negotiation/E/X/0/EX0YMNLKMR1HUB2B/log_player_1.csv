Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it.
* **Time Pressure:** By suggesting she'll list it publicly, Alice creates a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice is secure knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 if Bob rejects the offer."
