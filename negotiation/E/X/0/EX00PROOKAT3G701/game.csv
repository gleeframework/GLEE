"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my needs.  However, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering I'm still paying more than what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $10,500 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I initially wanted, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,800. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",9800.0,Alice,5,
