"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,350,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't regret.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's try one more time. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before I need to consider other offers.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
