"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,750,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our negotiation so far.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I receive a fair value for my product.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Can you consider this offer?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
