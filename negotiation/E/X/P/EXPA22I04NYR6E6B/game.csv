"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still being a good deal for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price considering my initial offer and the value you've placed on the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
