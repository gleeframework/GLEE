"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product is worth $800,000 to me, I'd be happy to pay $900,000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000.  It's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $975,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
