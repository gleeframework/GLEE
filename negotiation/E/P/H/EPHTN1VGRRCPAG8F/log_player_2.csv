# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is far above your budget. It's best to counteroffer and see if you can negotiate a better price."

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $2,000,000 is still above your budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your target price."
