"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, though. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $775,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to make one final concession, but $800,000 is my absolute minimum.  It's a fantastic price for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're able to meet me there.  If not, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
