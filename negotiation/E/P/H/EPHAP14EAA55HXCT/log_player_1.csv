{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to value:**  I'm highlighting the value Bob will get from the product. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter with a slightly lower price. 
* If the negotiation stalls, I'll always have the option to sell to John for my minimum price of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and even below Bob's perceived value of $800,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's initial offer is too far off. I can likely get a better price with a counteroffer.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me the leverage to hold firm and negotiate a more favorable price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $850,000.  I'll emphasize the product's value and my willingness to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price too far below my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, though. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at the higher price.
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm encouraging Bob to respond and continue the conversation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll consider making a final counteroffer closer to $800,000.
* If Bob accepts, we'll have reached a mutually beneficial agreement.
* If the negotiations stall, I'll sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $775,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and significantly below what I know the product is worth to him ($800,000). 
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  At this point, I believe there's not much further room to lower my price without risking a significant loss. 
* **John is a good alternative:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I can afford to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price around $800,000. 
* If Bob rejects this final offer, I will immediately sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to maximize my profits."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to make one final concession, but $800,000 is my absolute minimum.

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear that this is my final offer.  It's a firm price point but still close to Bob's perceived value.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm subtly creating a sense of urgency by mentioning other buyers, making Bob more likely to consider my offer seriously.
* **Value Reminder:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, emphasizing that this is still a good deal for him.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this final offer, I will immediately sell the product to John for $1,000,000.
