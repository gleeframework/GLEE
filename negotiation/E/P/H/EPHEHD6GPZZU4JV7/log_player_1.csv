Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John,  trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly less than our minimum acceptable price but still provides a substantial profit margin over Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than our guaranteed $1,200,000. 

By starting with a strong but negotiable offer, we aim to maximize our potential profit while still maintaining a good chance of closing the deal with Bob."
