{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $17,000 is a considerable improvement from Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to $10,000.  There are still 7 rounds remaining, so there's time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise.  $12,000 is still well below Alice's offer, but a significant step up from my previous offer.  I'm aiming for a middle ground while keeping in mind my $10,000 budget."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $15,000 is still too high for my budget. Even though it's getting closer, I'm going to see if I can push for a lower price. I've got 5 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm raising my offer again, but only slightly. It's clear Alice is willing to come down in price, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be accepted, but if not, I still have a few rounds to negotiate."
