"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above my budget and even above my perceived value of the product. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) to see how much Alice is willing to move on price.  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Direct:**  I'm being polite but also making it clear that her initial offer is not acceptable.
* **Expressing Interest:** I'm still showing interest in the product to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved towards my price, $14,000 is still $2,000 more than John's offer. There's no rush to accept yet.
* **Alice is Flexible:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests I can get a better price. 

I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference between our last offers?  Would you be willing to do $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** I'm proposing a price that meets my absolute maximum budget. This leaves no ambiguity about what I'm willing to pay. 
* **Fairness:** Splitting the difference between our last offers ($14,000 and $10,000) could be perceived as a fair compromise.
* **John's Offer:** By offering $12,000, I'm matching John's offer. This gives Alice a final chance to make a deal before I might consider John's offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $13,500. This is still a good deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** Alice only moved $500 from her last offer. This suggests she might be getting close to her bottom line, but I still have some leverage. 
* **John's Offer is Better:** $13,500 is still a significant amount more than John's offer of $12,000.  I'm willing to push Alice a bit further to see if she'll come down more. 

I'll reject the offer and propose a price closer to John's in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I can do $12,500, but that's the absolute most I can offer. It's a great price considering the market and my other options."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer (Almost):**  I'm signaling that this is my final offer, or very close to it.  The additional $500 is a small concession to show flexibility, but I'm sticking close to John's price.
* **Alternative Options:** By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm subtly reminding Alice that I'm not desperate and will walk away if the deal isn't right. 
* **Pressure:** Alice is more likely to accept a smaller concession now than to risk me taking John's offer in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as high as $12,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. I'm offering the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice has barely budged in her last few offers. She's likely close to her absolute bottom line, and it's unlikely she'll go below $13,000.
* **John's Offer is Safer:** Continuing the negotiation with Alice has a high risk with minimal potential reward. I'm likely to only save a few hundred dollars at best, and I might end up with no deal at all. John's offer is a guaranteed $12,000, which is a good deal.
* **Time is Valuable:** I've spent several rounds negotiating, and I'm reaching the halfway point of the rounds. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed win with John."
