Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still secures a significant profit for me.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob. I'm not desperate to accept anything below that."
