Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special price of $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident this offer represents a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below our own minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and we can still likely settle somewhere above our $12,000 minimum.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, we don't lose anything because we have a guaranteed sale to John at our desired price."
