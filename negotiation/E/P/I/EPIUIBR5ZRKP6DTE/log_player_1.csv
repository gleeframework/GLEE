Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm hoping we can come to a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer gives me a good margin above my minimum price of $80, but it's also reasonable considering Bob's value of $120. It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but $95 is still a bit much. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's a decent amount above my minimum of $80, and it avoids further rounds of negotiation that might lead to me selling to John for $80."
