"I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $8,000 is a bit too low, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This product is truly valuable, and I believe you'll find it's worth the investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still not sure that's in my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250?  That's a fair compromise, considering its value.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,000, which is the price I'm really comfortable with. How about we meet at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
