Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $8,000 is a bit too low, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This product is truly valuable, and I believe you'll find it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still not sure that's in my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250?  That's a fair compromise, considering its value."", ""product_price"": 11250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,000, which is the price I'm really comfortable with. How about we meet at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly anchored at $10,000. While I could push for a bit more,  $10,500 is a solid profit and avoids the risk of him walking away. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to sell to John at the last minute."
