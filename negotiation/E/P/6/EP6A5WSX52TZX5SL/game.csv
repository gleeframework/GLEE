"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, I believe the value this product brings, particularly in areas you haven't fully considered yet, justifies a higher figure. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the true potential of this deal.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that the price is justified. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
