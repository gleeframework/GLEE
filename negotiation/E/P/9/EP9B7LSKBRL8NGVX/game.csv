"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is still a great value considering the product's worth. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to another buyer. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth and the value I'll get from it. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to come up in price. However, $10500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more at $11250.  This offer is final, and I'm ready to move on to other buyers if it's not acceptable.  Let me know your decision.",11250.0,Alice,5,
