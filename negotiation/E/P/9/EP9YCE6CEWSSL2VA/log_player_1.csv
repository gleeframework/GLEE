Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed our negotiations so far and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to propose a price of $1,330,000 for the product.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would ideally like to get closer to my target price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and $1,330,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's better than selling to John for $1,500,000, and I might not get a better offer from Bob."
