"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $17000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $17000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to pay $14000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $16000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Plus, I'm willing to throw in some extra perks to sweeten the deal.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extra perks, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. That's my final offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me there.",13500.0,Bob,6,
