I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is serious about negotiating.  If she's willing to sell for close to $1,000,000, this offer will likely trigger a counteroffer from her."

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're getting closer to my target. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice might walk away, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to accept her offer and get the product now."
