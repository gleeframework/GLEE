# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's still very attractive. I'm asking for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
