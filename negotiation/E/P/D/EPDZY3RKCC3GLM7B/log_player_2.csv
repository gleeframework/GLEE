"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm looking for $110 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $110 is above Bob's maximum price of $120.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price down as much as possible while still keeping it within his budget. $105 is a reasonable counteroffer that is still below his maximum price of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $108. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is still within Bob's budget, and it's a reasonable compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
