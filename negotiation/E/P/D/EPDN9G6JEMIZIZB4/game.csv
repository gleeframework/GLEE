"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  It doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a fair price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,400,000?  This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value and allows you to stay within your budget.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
