,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $180. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",180.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $180. I can meet you in the middle at $220. Would you be willing to consider that price?",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $220 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $190 for the product. Can you consider that price?",190.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $210. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",210.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but $210 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $185 for the product. Can you consider that price?",185.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $200. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a significant concession, but $200 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $180 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",180.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're sticking to your guns at $180, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to have to pass on selling to you and explore other options. I'll be in touch if I don't hear back from you, but for now, I'm going to move on.",200.0,Alice,9,
