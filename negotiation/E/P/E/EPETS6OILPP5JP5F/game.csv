"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $600,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $750,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the true value of the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's unique features and benefits.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $725,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Let's meet in the middle at $700,000.  This represents a good compromise for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price at $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $715,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",715000.0,Alice,5,
