"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $10,000 to you, I propose we start our negotiation at $12,000. This price reflects the quality and exclusivity of the product while allowing us to reach a fair agreement. Let me know if this proposal works for you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
