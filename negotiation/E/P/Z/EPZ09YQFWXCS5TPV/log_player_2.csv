"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $10,000 to you, I propose we start our negotiation at $12,000. This price reflects the quality and exclusivity of the product while allowing us to reach a fair agreement. Let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  Bob's maximum budget is $10,000, and Alice is offering $12,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and counter-offering.
* **Buying from John is always an option.** Bob has a guaranteed alternative at $10,000, which gives him leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to buy, but my budget is $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground at that price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
