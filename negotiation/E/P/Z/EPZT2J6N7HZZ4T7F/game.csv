"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1400000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1250000 is significantly below what the product is worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price still reflects the value of the product, while giving you a significant discount.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I value our ongoing discussion. While $1300000 is closer to my desired price, I still need to ensure the deal is mutually beneficial.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1325000.

"Alice,  we're getting closer. However, $1325000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1275000. This offer is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1275000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering a final price of $1300000. This is my best offer, and it reflects a significant discount while still being fair to both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
