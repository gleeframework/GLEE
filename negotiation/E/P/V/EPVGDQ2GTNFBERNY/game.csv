,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product,  $1200000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1050000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1050000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  Let's keep working towards a deal that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $950000, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if that's enough to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1025000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me. While I appreciate your compromise, $1025000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975000. This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's close this agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975000 and my previous offer of $1025000, which would be $1000000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1000000 is still a bit too high, but I'm feeling confident that we can close this deal. I'm willing to go up to $990000.  This represents a significant effort to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's finalize this agreement.",990000.0,Bob,8,
