"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows for potential gains while also giving Bob some incentive to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counteroffer at $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is higher than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation going and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $95 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm still aiming to maximize my profit, but I'm also recognizing that we need to find a middle ground.  This counteroffer shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my desired price, I still believe there is room for improvement. I'm going to reject the offer and try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round.  I want to see if I can close the deal without having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $100.  How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50?  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 102.5} 
```

I'm offering a small compromise by meeting Bob halfway, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired goal.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your proposal, Alice. I am willing to pay $98 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While $98 is better than his previous offers, it's still not worth the risk of further negotiations.  It's best to secure the guaranteed sale to John at this point."
