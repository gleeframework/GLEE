Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,750 is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose an offer of $9,600 for the product. This price is within my budget and I believe it's a fair compromise. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, $9,600 is a reasonable offer from Bob.  It's within my minimum price range, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
