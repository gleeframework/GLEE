Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a higher initial offer ($150) allows room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $100 to both of us, there's a potential $50 surplus that we can try to capture.  This strategy aims to:

* **Test Bob's willingness to pay:**  A high initial offer gauges how much Bob values the product and how eager he is to purchase.
* **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob accepts the $150, I earn the maximum possible profit. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, I can gradually lower the price while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum of $100.

I'm prepared to negotiate down, but I won't go below $100 because I have John as a guaranteed buyer at that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $75 is significantly below both my minimum price ($100) and his own valuation of the product ($100). This suggests he's aiming for a very favorable deal. While I want to maximize profit, accepting this offer would be a significant loss. It's more strategic to counter-offer and see if we can find a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $75 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference Tactic:** By countering with $120, I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between my initial offer ($150) and his offer ($75). This common negotiation tactic can signal fairness and a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $120 is still a comfortable margin above my minimum acceptable price ($100), leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Testing Bob's Flexibility:**  This counter-offer will reveal whether Bob is genuinely interested in negotiating or if he's anchored to a very low price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to sell at a loss when I have a guaranteed buyer at $100.  I'll counter-offer one more time to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm seeing your price range, and I want to make this work. How about we settle at $100 even? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching My Limit:**  I'm now at my absolute minimum price. It's important to be clear and firm about this to signal to Bob that this is my best offer.
* **Fair Deal:** Offering $100 is fair since it's the price the product is worth to both of us.
* **Time to Decide:** This counter-offer puts the ball in Bob's court. He can either accept a fair deal or risk losing the opportunity to buy the product. I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob rejects this offer."
