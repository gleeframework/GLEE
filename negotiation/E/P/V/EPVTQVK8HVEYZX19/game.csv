"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,150,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to go as low as $1,250,000 to make this work.  This is a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000, which is the price I was initially considering when I had the option to buy from John. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
