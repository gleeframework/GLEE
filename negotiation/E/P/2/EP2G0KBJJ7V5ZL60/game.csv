"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in making a serious offer, but I can only go up to $800000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price given the value to me and the opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is still a premium price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $850000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's reach an agreement and make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal. ",900000.0,Bob,6,
