"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's very fair for both of us. I'm asking for $1200000, which allows you to make a significant profit while still giving me a fair return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
