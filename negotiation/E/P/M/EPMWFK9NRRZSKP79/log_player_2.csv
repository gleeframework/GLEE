Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $8,500. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.

# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,200. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about the product. I'll meet you at $8,150. This is my final offer.

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice is signaling finality:** Her language (""final offer"", ""one more concession"") implies she won't go much lower.
* **You're close to John's price:**  Continuing to negotiate might force you to go above John's $10,000, negating the savings.
* **Substantial savings:** You've already gotten the price down considerably from the initial $9,000."
