"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $9,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $8,500. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're getting close to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,200. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about the product. I'll meet you at $8,150. This is my final offer.",8150.0,Alice,5,
