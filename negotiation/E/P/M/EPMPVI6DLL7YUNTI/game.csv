"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm starting at $12000, but I'm open to reasonable offers. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $9000?  I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $9000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $10500. That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to make a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're still looking for a higher price, but $10500 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $10000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $10250?  It's closer to your offer, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10250 is still a bit more than I can manage.  If you're willing to meet me at $10000, we can close the deal.  This is my final offer, as I have another option available for the same product.",10000.0,Bob,6,
