"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm starting at $12000, but I'm open to reasonable offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's always a good strategy to start by rejecting and making a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $9,000?  I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price shows you're serious about negotiating.  
* **Budget Justification:**  Mentioning your budget helps Alice understand your position and potentially make concessions.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording ""consider"" and ""serious about buying"" implies flexibility while still setting a clear price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $9000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $10500. That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You have a chance to potentially get a better price by making another counteroffer, especially since Alice already showed willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're still looking for a higher price, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  You're reiterating your maximum budget, showing you're serious about closing the deal but not willing to go higher.
* **""Explore other options"" implication:** This subtly hints that you're considering John's offer, adding pressure to Alice.
* **Direct and Concise:**  The message clearly states your final price and emphasizes the ""finality"" to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $10250?  It's closer to your offer, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but $10,250 is still above your maximum budget.  It's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price or close the deal with John, as there is still room for Alice to concede and you have a clear alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,250 is still a bit more than I can manage.  If you're willing to meet me at $10,000, we can close the deal.  This is my final offer, as I have another option available for the same product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  You're reiterating that this is your final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Alternative Option:**  The ""another option available"" statement subtly reinforces the fact that you have a backup plan (John's offer).
* **Focus on Agreement:**  The message emphasizes closing the deal and finding a mutually beneficial solution."
