Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **Lower than my minimum acceptable value:** This ensures I don't lose out on a significant amount of profit.

This starting offer creates room for negotiation, and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, especially since he's already shown interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give in completely.
* **Lower than my initial offer:**  This indicates a willingness to meet halfway, while still preserving a decent profit margin.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and increases the chances of reaching an agreement without losing out on a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $11,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm starting to lose patience.  John is a sure thing, and I'm not willing to risk a longer negotiation that might result in a worse outcome. I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $15,000."
