,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that.  $12,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,800? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",12800.0,Alice,5,
