"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,
