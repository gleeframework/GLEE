"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,200. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal with John at $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
