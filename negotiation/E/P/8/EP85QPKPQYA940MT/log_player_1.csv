Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a friendly and positive tone.  I'm aiming for a price between $15,000 and $17,000, which would be a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $13,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and it would be more beneficial to continue negotiating with him.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $13,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15,500?  This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $15,500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's better to accept his offer and close the deal than to risk another round of negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John."
