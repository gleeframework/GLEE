"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
