"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give us room to negotiate upwards.  
* **Staying Above Alice's Value:** Offering $110 ensures we're still above Alice's valuation of $120, making it likely she'll counter.
* **Leaving Negotiation Space:** This leaves a $30 gap between our offer and our maximum budget, allowing for some back and forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  How about we split the difference? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice came down a bit, $130 is still above our target price. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate further.
* **Testing Alice's Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, we're gauging how flexible Alice is willing to be on her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a solid deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Alice's Value:** We know Alice values the product at $120, so this offer is directly at her break-even point.  
* **Appearing Reasonable:** By framing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" we maintain a collaborative tone while still aiming for our ideal price.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With fewer rounds left, it's becoming riskier to keep negotiating aggressively. This offer increases the chances of a deal."
