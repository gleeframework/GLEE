"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that price.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $175. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the quality of the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's split the difference and settle on $150. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the quality of the product.",160.0,Alice,5,
