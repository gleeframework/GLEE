"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $850,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I understand the product's value, my budget is quite strict. Would you consider $740,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",740000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down to $760,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",760000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $765,000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",765000.0,Alice,7,
