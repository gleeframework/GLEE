"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $15,000.  I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob or I can sell to John for my full asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  However, $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. How about we split the difference?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
