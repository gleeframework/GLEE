# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our flagship product, which holds immense value for you at $15,000. I am offering this exceptional item to you at a special price of $14,000. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored to meet your needs and expectations. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer. By rejecting her offer, you open up the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or sticking with your backup plan of buying from John for $15,000."
