"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price that leaves us both with a decent margin.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still leaves a substantial profit margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $1,000,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000? It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
