"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do like the product, $90 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

This counteroffer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:**  Maintains a good negotiating relationship with Alice.
* **Signals interest but with reservations:** Shows we're interested but not at the initial price.
* **Anchors a lower price:**  $65 is a significant drop from $90, aiming to shift the negotiation closer to our desired range. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** We don't want to go too low too quickly, as it might offend Alice and make her less willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice is moving towards our desired price range, but $82.50 is still above our target.
* **Negotiating Power:**  We have rounds to spare and Alice seems open to negotiation. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on for her to lower the price further. 
* **Alternative:**  While John's offer of $100 is always available, there's a decent chance of securing a better deal with Alice if we continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle on $75?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price that splits the difference between her last offer ($82.50) and our previous counteroffer ($65). This is a common negotiation tactic and often perceived as fair.
* **Clear Target:**  We're getting closer to our ideal price range, and $75 is a good target to aim for. 
* **Direct and Simple:**  The message keeps the tone positive but direct, making our intentions clear without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you the product for $80. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At Value:** Alice has met her own valuation of the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, especially since she stated this is her final offer.
* **Good Deal:** $80 is a good price, saving us $20 compared to John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks jeopardizing the deal.  While we might get it slightly cheaper, the potential savings are likely small compared to the risk of Alice walking away."
