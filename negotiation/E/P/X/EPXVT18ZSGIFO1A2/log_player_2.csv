"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay. He has 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $250,000.  This demonstrates his seriousness in wanting the product but also establishes a lower price point for negotiations. It's aggressive but leaves room for potential compromise in the coming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still above his ideal price.  Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate and rejected a higher offer. Rejecting this offer again keeps the pressure on Alice and shows Bob is committed to getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price but is still trying to save as much as possible. Increasing the offer to $1,050,000 shows he's willing to meet Alice halfway, while still leaving room for negotiation in the remaining rounds. This strategy demonstrates his seriousness while maintaining leverage to potentially secure a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still very close to his maximum price, but with five rounds remaining, he can likely get a slightly better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps him in the negotiation and prevents him from potentially settling for a price that's just above his limit.  Continuing to negotiate could yield a price closer to $1,050,000 or potentially even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1030000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer but only by $20,000. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product but is still trying to get the best possible price. With only four rounds left, this is a calculated risk. Bob is trying to get as close to his $1,000,000 limit as possible without risking losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time and only three rounds remain. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  With only three rounds left, there's a risk that Alice will continue to reject Bob's counteroffers. Buying from John guarantees the product for Bob's maximum price, ensuring he gets the product and avoids further potential losses in the negotiation."
