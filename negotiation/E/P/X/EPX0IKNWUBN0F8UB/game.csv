"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you've described.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'm willing to go up to $1025000. I hope we can find a compromise.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1025000 is a fair price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000, which is still below my original asking price of $1200000.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to find a mutually agreeable price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000, but I need to make it clear that this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
