"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my business. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This price reflects the significant value this product can bring to your business, while also allowing for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. Would you be willing to consider $920,000? I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to my business.",920000.0,Bob,4,
