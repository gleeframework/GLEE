"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's valued at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12500, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12500 is still slightly above what I'm comfortable paying. How about $11500 as a final offer? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
