Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, which is what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below John's offer allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Create Urgency:**  By mentioning ""listing it publicly"" and ""demand,"" Alice subtly pressures Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still keeping the deal attractive enough for him to accept."
