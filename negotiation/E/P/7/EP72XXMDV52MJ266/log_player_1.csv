"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer downwards in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's not even close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm rejecting his offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's also a more realistic price point considering Bob's initial offer.  I'm hoping this will start a more productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's an improvement from his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm rejecting his offer and will continue negotiating with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm going to drop my price to $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally see the value in my product. If he rejects this offer, I'll go ahead and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  I'm not confident I can get a better price from him, and it's not worth risking a deal falling through. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
