"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a reasonable price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm on a tight budget and $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is the last price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
