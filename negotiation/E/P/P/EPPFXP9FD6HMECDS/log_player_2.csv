""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm on a tight budget and $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?"",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is the last price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation when you have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000."
