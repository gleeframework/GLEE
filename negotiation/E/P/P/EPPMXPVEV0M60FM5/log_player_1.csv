{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still allowing you to potentially earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $10,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation. John is offering a price that meets my minimum and provides a more secure outcome."
