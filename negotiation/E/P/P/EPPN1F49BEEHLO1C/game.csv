"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is truly significant, and $750,000 undervalues it. I could consider a price of $925,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",850000.0,Bob,4,
