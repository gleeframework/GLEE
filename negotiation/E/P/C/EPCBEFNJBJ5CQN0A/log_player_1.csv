Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $9,000 to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit stuck on the price. Can we meet in the middle at $8,750? I really think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I have a few more rounds to negotiate and I'm hoping to get closer to $9,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Can we go down to $8,750? I really think that's the most I can afford.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  We've reached a point where it's clear that Bob and I are unlikely to come to an agreement that is both fair and profitable for me.  It's better to take the sure thing and sell to John, as it will give me the best return on my investment."
