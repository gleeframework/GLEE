Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, making it more likely he'll negotiate down rather than just reject it outright. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  It leaves room for you to negotiate down without going below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It doesn't waste time with unnecessary details, gets straight to the point, and shows confidence.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also be mindful of the possibility of losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That way, we both get a good deal and I can still make a profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can only go up to $9,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still too low for me. While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, I'm realizing that time is money, and I'm already at a point where I'm risking not being able to sell to John at all.  I need to secure a sale and get my minimum price.  Therefore, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000."
