Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Backup Option:** I'm aware I can sell to John for $100, ensuring I won't go below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I know the product is worth $120 to him.  I'll try to negotiate for a better price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $108?"",
""product_price"": 108
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Strategic Counter:** The $108 price point aims to split the difference between his offer ($100) and my previous ask ($115). 
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price still allows for a reasonable profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I am still aiming to keep my expenses lower. Could we perhaps agree on $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to stay within a budget, and while I could push for a bit more, accepting his offer of $105 is a good compromise.  

* **Solid Profit:** It's still a $5 profit over my minimum acceptable price and a $15 profit over selling to John.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Further negotiation might frustrate Bob, leading him to walk away. It's better to secure a good deal now."
