"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110, which is the lowest I can go.",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $105? I think that's a fair compromise considering your need to make a profit and my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already met you halfway and then a bit more. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a decent profit. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $108.",108.0,Alice,5,,
