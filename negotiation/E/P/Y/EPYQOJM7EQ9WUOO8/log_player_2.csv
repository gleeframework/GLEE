"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is much higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me, but I am interested.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $100 is quite a bit lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening counteroffer. It leaves room for negotiation and gauges Alice's willingness to move on price.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message maintains a positive and respectful tone, emphasizing interest in the product while clearly stating the price is an issue."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down in price, $140 is still above your $120 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a decent gap between her offer and your limit, suggesting more negotiation might be beneficial.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** You always have the option of buying from John for $120, which can influence your negotiating strategy with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $115? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** This counteroffer moves closer to your $120 limit while still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Compromise Emphasis:** The message frames the offer as a fair compromise, hopefully encouraging Alice to accept.
* **Time Pressure:** As rounds progress, you might consider slightly increasing your offer to avoid reaching John's price point too late in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'll try to meet you halfway again. I'll offer it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Close to John:** At $130, Alice's offer is only slightly cheaper than John's $120 price. 
* **Potential for More:** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. Rejecting might push her closer to your desired price range.
* **Risk Assessment:**  With five rounds remaining, you have a bit more leeway to negotiate. However, be mindful of the decreasing rounds and potentially raise your offer slightly in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $120, my final offer, to make this work.  It's a great product, and I'd be happy to close the deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is your final offer, you signal seriousness and limit further back-and-forth.
* **Meeting Your Limit:**  Offering $120 aligns with your maximum budget and matches John's offer.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a polite and positive tone, emphasizing your desire to close the deal.

**Outcome:** This strategy increases the chances of Alice accepting, but there's a risk she might decline, forcing you to either buy from John or start over with a less advantageous position in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. I'll make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $135, which is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:** Alice has explicitly stated that $135 is her highest offer.
* **Above Budget:** $135 is still above your maximum budget of $120.
* **John's Offer is Better:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $120, which is a better deal than Alice's final offer.

**It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best possible price from John.**"
