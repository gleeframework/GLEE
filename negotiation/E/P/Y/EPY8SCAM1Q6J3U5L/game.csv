"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a price of $180. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I place on the product and the price you're willing to pay.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $130. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",130.0,Alice,5,
