Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  To start, I'm willing to sell it for $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $700,000 is too low for me, even though I know he values the product at $800,000.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and there's a chance I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This gives us both a good margin to work with."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000.  Would that be workable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $800,000. I have 6 more rounds left to negotiate, so I'm not ready to sell for $750,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  While $825,000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $780,000.  Do you think we can make something work around there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $800,000. I have 4 more rounds left to negotiate, so I'm not ready to sell for $780,000 yet.  While it's tempting to take that offer, John is always a solid backup plan if negotiations continue to stall."
