"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  To start, I'm willing to sell it for $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This gives us both a good margin to work with.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000.  Would that be workable for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  While $825,000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $780,000.  Do you think we can make something work around there?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While I'm not quite ready to go down to $780,000, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,7,
