,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly below my initial offer, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1000000. This price still reflects the value I believe this product holds for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're eager to secure the product, but $900000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on it. Let's find a compromise closer to my last offer. How about $950000? It's a fair meeting point that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",950000.0,Alice,5,
