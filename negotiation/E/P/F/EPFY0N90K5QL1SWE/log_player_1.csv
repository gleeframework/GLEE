Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,150,000 offer is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving you negotiating room.
    *  Attractive enough to potentially entice Bob, as it's still below your guaranteed price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
