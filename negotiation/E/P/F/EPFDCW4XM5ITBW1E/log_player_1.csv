{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. It also shows I'm willing to be flexible, hopefully encouraging a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $130 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 
I'm going to counter with a price of $135. This is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $132.50 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $132.50 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $134.  This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 134}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $134. This is my final offer. I'm hoping that Bob will accept it, as it's still a good deal for him, and I'm getting closer to my minimum price. If he rejects, I'll sell to John for $150."
