,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'd be happy to buy it for $15000. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18000, but I'm not going any lower than that.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $16500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $17500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $17500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $17000, which is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to go with another option.",17000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $17000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $18250. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",18250.0,Alice,7,
