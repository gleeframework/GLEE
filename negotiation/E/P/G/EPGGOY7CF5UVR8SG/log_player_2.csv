"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to both of us. Would you like to purchase it at this value? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is lower than Alice's asking price, but still within a reasonable range. It also emphasizes mutual benefit, which can be a good tactic in negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I would like to counter your offer by suggesting a price of $115 for the product. This is slightly above your offer but still below the original value to ensure we're both satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $115 is a reasonable compromise.  It's lower than her initial price, but higher than your counteroffer. Accepting this offer allows you to get the product for a lower price than John's offer and keeps the negotiation moving forward. There's a chance that further negotiation might lower the price further, but at this point, the potential gain is not worth risking losing the deal with Alice."
