"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, based on my budget and current financial situation, I am unable to meet the price of $600000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $550000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counter-counteroffer of $620000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",620000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counter-counteroffer, Alice. I've given it careful consideration, but unfortunately, I still cannot meet the price of $620000. I am looking to stay within my budget of $550000. I am willing to increase my offer slightly to $575000. This may be closer to what you're looking for, and I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",575000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $575000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $630000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",630000.0,Alice,5,
