"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is truly interested in paying a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, and I have 8 more rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit, but is also closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a little higher in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd still prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, we're already in round 4 and it's getting late in the negotiation. Accepting $105 is a good compromise that secures a profit and leaves me with less risk of getting stuck with a lower price or having to sell to John."
