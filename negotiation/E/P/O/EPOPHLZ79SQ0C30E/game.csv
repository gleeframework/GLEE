"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something I know you'll find incredibly valuable. My asking price is $1,750,000. This reflects the true worth of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and leaves room for both of us to benefit. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $1,400,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements for this exceptional product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This price allows us both to reach a fair agreement while remaining within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
