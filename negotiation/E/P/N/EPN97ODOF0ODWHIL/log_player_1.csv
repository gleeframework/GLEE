{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth significantly exceeds that for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, offering it slightly above that won't be enticing. 
* **John as a Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,200,000 from John, so there's no risk of getting stuck with the product.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. It also establishes the product's high value from the start."
