"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can do better. You are willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000, so there's room for a deal that benefits both of you.  Let's try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $9,500?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,250?  That way we both get a good deal, and I can still make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

It's a good deal for you. You're getting the product for $10,250, which is significantly lower than your maximum price of $12,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away, and you'll have to pay the full $12,000 to John. It's better to secure this deal."
