{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $11,000 is above your $8,000 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still $1,000 of potential profit for Bob, making the offer attractive but not too generous.
* **It sets the tone:**  This initial offer establishes that you're confident in the value of your product and are not afraid to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $9,500?  That's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You can likely get closer to your desired price of $11,000.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,250?  That way we both get a good deal, and I can still make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10250}
