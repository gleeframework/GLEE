"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our positions. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, and I'll meet you at $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10800.0,Alice,5,
