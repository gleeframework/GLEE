Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're still well above your $800,000 minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he has incentive to negotiate a lower price.
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:**  You can adjust your price based on Bob's response, potentially striking a deal closer to $1,000,000. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer.  It still gives me a good profit, and I'm confident Bob will see the value in closing this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob has consistently lowered his offers. Accepting his offer of $875,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's above my minimum of $800,000 and secures the deal without risking further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
