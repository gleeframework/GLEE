"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $1,200,000.  This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return on it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than your maximum budget ($1,500,000).**  This means you can still save money compared to buying from John.
* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($800,000).** This means she's willing to make a profit, which is a good sign that the product is likely worthwhile. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice, as it allows you to get the product at a lower price than John's while still leaving room for a potential profit for Alice."
