"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. You should definitely reject and counteroffer, aiming to get the price much lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While I'm interested, $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target. This leaves room for bargaining.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is courteous but clearly states that the initial offer is unacceptable.
* **Justification:**  While not essential, implying a budget limitation can add weight to the counteroffer. 

This counteroffer aims to bring Alice closer to your desired price range. Keep in mind, Alice's response will determine your next move â€“ whether to go higher, accept a counteroffer, or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to your desired price, $130 is still significantly above your $100 limit. You have room to negotiate further. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right, which might encourage Alice to make a more substantial concession."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $130 is still a bit too high for me. Could you do $95? I think that's a fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Moving from $80 to $95 shows willingness to negotiate, but not at any cost.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The message emphasizes fairness, subtly suggesting that Alice is being unreasonable if she doesn't budge significantly.
* **Approaching the Limit:** This counteroffer gets very close to your $100 maximum. If Alice rejects this, you'll need to decide if a small increase is worthwhile or if you're better off with John."
