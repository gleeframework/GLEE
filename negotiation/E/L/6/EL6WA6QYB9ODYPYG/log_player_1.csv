Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it.  This price reflects the significant potential of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the potential benefits of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and make him consider the value proposition.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with a phrase that encourages Bob to engage in a discussion, rather than simply rejecting the offer. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation, giving me the opportunity to gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $900000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial asking price. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer with a price that's more reasonable for me but still reflects the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 to facilitate a deal.  This price still reflects the significant value this product can bring to your business. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:** I show respect for Bob's counteroffer and acknowledge his interest in the product.
* **Counter with a Lower Price:** I've lowered my price from $1,500,000 to $1,200,000, showing flexibility. This is still a good deal for me, and a reasonable compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value proposition of the product, reminding Bob of the benefits it can offer.
* **Maintain Openness:** I conclude by emphasizing the need for finding common ground, keeping the negotiation open and inviting Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  Since John is also offering $1,000,000, I'm choosing to sell to John. This ensures a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, eliminating the risk of further negotiations with Bob that might not yield a better outcome."
