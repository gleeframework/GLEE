I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers.

Bob's offer:

While Bob's latest offer is tempting, it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his price. Accepting a lower offer now risks leaving a substantial amount of money on the table.  It's time to move on to John and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000."
