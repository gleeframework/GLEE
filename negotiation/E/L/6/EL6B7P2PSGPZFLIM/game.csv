"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable paying, and I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the price gap is still significant for me. I'm willing to make one final concession to bridge the difference. Let's settle at $1,000,000. This is my absolute best offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of what you're getting.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is your absolute best offer, but I'm afraid it's still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",980000.0,Bob,6,
