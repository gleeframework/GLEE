Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to your product's value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,450,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Strong Alternative:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your desired price, giving you a strong position. This means you don't need to desperately lowball the price to Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay. If you had that information, you could potentially push the price even closer to that limit."
