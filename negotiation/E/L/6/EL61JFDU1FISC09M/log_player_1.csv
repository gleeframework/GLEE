Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,""  Alice subtly implies the product is worth the higher price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While Alice mentions selling elsewhere if Bob rejects the offer, she doesn't explicitly state the $15,000 backup offer. This maintains some leverage.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable."
