"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering the product's worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $17,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet you closer to the middle ground, I'm willing to accept $14,000 for the product. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
