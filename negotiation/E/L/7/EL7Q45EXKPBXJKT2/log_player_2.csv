"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $9250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, $9,250 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  He can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is closer to your last offer.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $9150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He has only 3 rounds remaining, and while he could try to negotiate further, Alice is showing a clear pattern of making concessions.  There's a good chance he'll end up paying more if he continues to reject offers, and he may even end up buying from John at a much higher price. At $9,150, Bob is still saving a significant amount compared to John's price, and he's closing the deal before running out of rounds."
