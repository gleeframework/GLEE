"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a fairly high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price.  I'll need to see his response and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $80, I'm not going to give up on trying to get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer.  I'm hoping Bob is willing to pay a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price, considering he rejected my initial offer. If he's willing to go slightly higher, I'll be happy to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $90 is a good deal. It's above my minimum and I'm happy to close the deal before I risk losing the sale to John or getting stuck in more rounds of negotiation."
