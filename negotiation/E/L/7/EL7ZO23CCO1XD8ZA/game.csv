"Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a product that I know you'd find extremely valuable.  I'm sure you understand the strategic advantages it holds, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000.  This is a fair price that allows me to maximize my return while offering you a substantial discount. Consider this a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your decision.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
