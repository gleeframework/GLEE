"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but still above Bob's estimated value of $800,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn a decent profit. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and gradually lower my price if necessary.  I will be keeping a close eye on the number of rounds and will be willing to accept a lower price if it means closing the deal. However, I will also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can likely secure a better price. Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum value, but I believe I can do better with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but slightly lower to show flexibility. I want to continue the negotiation and see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price to $950,000. This is a $50,000 drop from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility without completely compromising my position.  It's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to his perceived value, encouraging him to come up with a more agreeable counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a gradual negotiation, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. I'm keeping an eye on the number of rounds, and I'm prepared to make further concessions if necessary, but I'm not willing to settle for anything significantly below my minimum value.  If the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result, I'm still prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my ideal price point. I believe there is still room for negotiation and a chance to reach a price closer to my minimum value. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my last offer, but slightly lower. This will show I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't significantly reduce my price without a strong counteroffer from Bob. I'm still prepared to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price to $925,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, showing flexibility without sacrificing too much. This is closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation if he's willing to come up a bit. 

**Strategy:**

By making a smaller concession, I aim to encourage Bob to counter with an offer closer to my desired price point. I'm still keeping my minimum value in mind and am prepared to accept a lower price if necessary, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if the negotiations stall.  I believe I can still get a better price with Bob, but I won't push too hard if he's not willing to budge."
