"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to start with a bold counteroffer that is close to his maximum budget but still leaves some room for negotiation. $850,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer and is a good starting point to see if she's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than he wants to pay. He's already made a counteroffer, and Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate. It's worth continuing the negotiation process to see if he can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to increase his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating that he's willing to compromise. However, he still wants to stay below his maximum budget. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is still seeking a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget than John's price of $800,000.  While it's still not ideal, it's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and a reasonable compromise.  With only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely Bob will be able to get a lower price from Alice. It's better to accept this offer and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
