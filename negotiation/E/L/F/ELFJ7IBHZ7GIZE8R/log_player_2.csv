"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $800,000. By rejecting her offer, you create the opportunity for a better deal.  You can then try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, knowing John is a backup option at $1,000,000."
