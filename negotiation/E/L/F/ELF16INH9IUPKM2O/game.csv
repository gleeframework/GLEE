"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe will be immensely valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've reviewed your latest offer and while I appreciate the adjustment, I still feel that the product's value doesn't quite match the price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $825,000. This feels closer to a fair valuation for me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
