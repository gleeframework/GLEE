Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to be made if you sell to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob.  Offering a price too low risks losing him to a competitor.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its significant potential for you.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" to pique Bob's interest.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the profit margin ($150,000) while still offering Bob a $50,000 discount from his perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
