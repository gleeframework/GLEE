I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum, but I believe there's a good chance Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium. 

If he rejects, I'll happily sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I still make a solid profit. This strategy balances the potential for a higher gain with the security of a guaranteed lower sale."
