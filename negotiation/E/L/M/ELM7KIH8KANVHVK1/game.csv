"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm looking to spend around $80 on this.  How about $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 was a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $95?  That's a fair compromise and keeps us both in the game.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to go down to $97.50, but that's as low as I can go.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. While $97.50 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $96?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",96.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $96 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $98.50, but that's as low as I can go.",98.5,Alice,7,
