"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $110 is too high.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm looking to spend around $80 on this.  How about $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by acknowledging Alice's offer but emphasizes his budget constraint.  Offering $90 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate.  It's a reasonable starting point for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 was a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is a step in the right direction, Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his budget.  He's already established a willingness to pay around $90 and should continue to negotiate for a better deal. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $95?  That's a fair compromise and keeps us both in the game."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing for a price closer to his target of $80. Offering $95 shows he's willing to compromise but is still standing firm. This counteroffer is a reasonable step towards finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $95 is a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to go down to $97.50, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $97.50 is still higher than Bob's target of $80. Even though it's closer than previous offers, Bob has a reliable alternative in John, who is willing to sell the product for his target price. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a lower price, and keep John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. While $97.50 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $96?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 96}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a price closer to his target while remaining open to compromise.  The counteroffer of $96 is a middle ground between his previous offer of $95 and Alice's last offer of $97.50.  This demonstrates a genuine attempt to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $96 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $98.50, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $98.50 is still above Bob's target price of $80. With only 3 rounds remaining, the negotiation is getting close to a stalemate. Bob has a reliable alternative in John, who offers the product for his target price.  It's more beneficial for Bob to take John's offer and save money rather than continue the negotiation with Alice."
