"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm looking to spend around $80 on this.  How about $90?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $95?  That's a fair compromise and keeps us both in the game.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. While $97.50 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $96?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.
