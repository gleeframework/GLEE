# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,100,000. This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package. This should give you added value and peace of mind.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've made significant concessions and added value to the deal, but I'm still not willing to meet your price at $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1,025,000. I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is my final offer.
