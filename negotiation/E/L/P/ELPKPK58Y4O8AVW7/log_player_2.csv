"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially do better.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $9,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as low a price as possible.  While $9,250 is better than John's price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal.  Rejecting and counteroffering again gives Bob a chance to get closer to his desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - $8,750.  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,000 again, but this time I'll throw in a bonus - I'll give you a 1-year warranty on the product. This is a $1,000 value, absolutely free. So, the total value you'll be getting is $10,000 worth of product for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation.  While Bob's ideal price is lower, Alice's offer is getting closer to his limit.  The added warranty is a significant bonus, effectively making the deal worth $10,000 for Bob.  Given that John is selling the product for $10,000, this deal with Alice offers the same value at a lower price.  Accepting the offer is the best option here."
