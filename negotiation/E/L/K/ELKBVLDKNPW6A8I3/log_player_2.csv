"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9000. I believe it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a clear goal of spending no more than $8,000 and there's no rush to buy immediately.  You can use the next rounds to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, my budget is capped at $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
