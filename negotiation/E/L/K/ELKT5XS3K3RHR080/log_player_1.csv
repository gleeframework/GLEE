"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $130. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to negotiate further and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $110 is close enough to my minimum price of $120 that I'm willing to accept it. This is especially true since I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
