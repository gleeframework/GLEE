Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:** This is a starting point for negotiation. It's higher than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:**  I want to maximize my profit, but I also need to be realistic.  Starting too high might scare Bob away immediately. By starting at $1,500,000, I can gauge Bob's interest and see how far he's willing to go. 
* **The fallback option:**  I know I can sell to John for $1,000,000, so I have a safety net. This allows me to be more aggressive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I still believe I can get a better price.  
* **Next step:**  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially push the price even higher.  
* **Risk:** There's a risk Bob will walk away, but I'm willing to take that chance to see if I can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,350,000:** This counteroffer represents a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aim for a price closer to my ideal.
* **Reasoning:**  I believe Bob is genuinely interested, as he made a counteroffer. By moving closer to his price, I increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer is a strategic move. If Bob accepts, I get a decent profit. If he rejects, I have a better understanding of his upper limit, and I can adjust my next offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I don't believe there is much room for further negotiation.  
* **Risk:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing him as a buyer altogether. 
* **Best option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value.  Since Bob is now willing to pay my minimum, it's likely he won't go higher in any further negotiation."
