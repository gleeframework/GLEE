Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this reflects its worth while acknowledging your potential interest."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price to allow room for bargaining. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, providing space for Bob to counteroffer and feel like he's getting a deal. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing your hand entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far too low.  While you want to negotiate, accepting such a low offer would be a significant loss.  It's time to counter and see if you can bring him closer to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 975000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility by dropping $125,000, but not so much as to appear desperate or undervalue the product. 
* **Anchoring:** By proposing a price significantly higher than Bob's offer, you're attempting to re-anchor the negotiation closer to your desired range.
* **Justification:**  Without giving specifics, the message reiterates the ""worth"" to justify the still-high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you consider $725,000? I feel that's a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value while working for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but $725,000 is still a significant way off from your minimum acceptable price. It's important to demonstrate you're willing to walk away if a fair deal isn't reached.  You will now make a counter offer closer to your minimum while also being aware you can sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  I'm prepared to make my final offer at $875,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair balance between its worth and your initial interest. "", ""product_price"": 875000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** By explicitly stating this is your ""final offer,"" you signal a firm stance, adding weight to your position.
* **Smaller Concession:** The smaller price reduction ($100,000) compared to previous rounds shows you're reaching your limit.
* **Balance:**  You're acknowledging his interest while still emphasizing the product's value as justification for the relatively high price. 

This positions you either to close the deal at a price reasonable for you or to walk away confidently knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
