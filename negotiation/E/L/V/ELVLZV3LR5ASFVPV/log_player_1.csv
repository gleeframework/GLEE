Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $110, which is above the product's value to Bob ($80). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Language:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message signals I'm open to negotiation, while still asserting a strong initial price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've made a good profit!
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll need to assess his counteroffer. If it's too low, I'll consider making a counteroffer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to save some money if possible. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value of the product ($80), it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. He's expressed interest in the product and is willing to pay a premium. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still too low for me.  How about $95?  That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise, falling halfway between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone, acknowledging Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I emphasize fairness as a reason for my counteroffer, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've secured a good price, exceeding my minimum threshold.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I'll need to carefully consider his next counteroffer. If it's still below my minimum, I might consider selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $92? That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $92 is still slightly below my minimum threshold of $100, it's very close. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Bob has indicated this is his final offer.  If I reject, he might walk away, and I'll only have the option of selling to John for $100.
* **Potential for Future Business:** Even though I'm not getting my full asking price, accepting Bob's offer could potentially lead to future business with him.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept and Move On:** I'll accept Bob's offer, secure a good profit, and build a relationship with a potential future customer."
