"I'm interested in the product, but $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,400,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price point. Would you consider $1,500,000 for this exceptional product?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
