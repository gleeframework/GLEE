Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin above my minimum price of $150, while still being potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price of $150. I believe this is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is offering my minimum price. While I could continue negotiating, it seems unlikely we'll get a better price than this. John is a sure thing for $150, so it's not worth risking another round with Bob."
