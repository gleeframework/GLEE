Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to propose a counter-offer."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that the price is justified.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""open to discussing"" signal your willingness to negotiate, which can make Bob more receptive.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** While you have John as a backup, you don't explicitly mention him to Bob. Revealing this information might weaken your negotiating position. 

**Important Note:**  The success of this strategy depends on factors like Bob's personality, negotiation skills, and how badly he wants the product. There's no guarantee he'll accept your initial offer."
