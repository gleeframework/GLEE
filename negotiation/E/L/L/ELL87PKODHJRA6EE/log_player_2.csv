"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I believe $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $15,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to her lowest acceptable price, but we can still try to negotiate a bit further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

We're nudging closer to Alice's likely minimum while still leaving us with some potential savings. This keeps the negotiation moving without conceding too much too quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and call it $11,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is definitely feeling the pressure now, but that $11,750 is still a bit high. We're getting close enough that another counteroffer could seal the deal in our favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're right, Alice, we're getting close! To make this a quick and easy deal, how about $11,250?"",
""product_price"": 11250
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference again, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate but standing firm on a price point that benefits us. This maintains a sense of progress and urgency towards a final agreement."
