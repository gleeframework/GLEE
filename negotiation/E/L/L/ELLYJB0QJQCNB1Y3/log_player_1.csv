Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to start with my minimum price of $120.  It's worth that much to me, so I'm not willing to go lower initially.  If Bob rejects this offer, we can negotiate further.  However, I have a backup option with John, so I won't feel pressured to sell below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $120, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I'm still holding firm at a price that's fair to me.  $110 is a good compromise, and hopefully Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum price, but it's closer than his previous offer.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $120, I'm willing to accept this offer and secure a sale.  It's better than nothing and will save me time and effort negotiating further."
