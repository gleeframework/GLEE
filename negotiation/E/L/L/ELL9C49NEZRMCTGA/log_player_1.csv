Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **My Minimum:** I need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** John provides a safety net at $100.

Offering the product at $115 allows me to:

* **Maximize Profit:** This price gets me the closest to Bob's maximum valuation without going over.
* **Exceed My Minimum:** I comfortably surpass my minimum price of $100. 
* **Provide Value to Bob:**  Bob still gets a $5 benefit compared to his valuation.

This strategy balances profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
