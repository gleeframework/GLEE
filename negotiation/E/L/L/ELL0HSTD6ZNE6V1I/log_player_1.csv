Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for a profit, and this offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's maximum value:**  This makes it appealing to Bob, as he stands to gain a significant amount.

By starting high, you maximize your potential earnings while also giving Bob an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to your minimum, you can likely do better. 
* **You have leverage:** You've demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and Bob is likely eager to finalize the deal.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  If the negotiation stalls, you can always go with John's offer, but it's not the ideal outcome.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain control and signal that you're not willing to settle for a price significantly below your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:** This price is significantly higher than your minimum, ensuring you still make a substantial profit.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, you demonstrate that you are not desperate and encourage further negotiation.

This counteroffer should be appealing to Bob while still leaving room for further negotiation, if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  While not ideal, $950,000 is only $50,000 below your minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and you could end up with a lower price or even selling to John.
* **Time and energy:**  Negotiations can be time-consuming and emotionally draining. Accepting this offer allows you to move on and potentially pursue other opportunities.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale that is reasonably close to your minimum, minimizing potential losses and avoiding further negotiation."
