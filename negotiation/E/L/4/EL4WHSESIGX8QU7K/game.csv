"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $120. Would you be willing to come down a bit?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $160, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130. Let's see if we can make this happen.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to get this product, but $140 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135. This is my final offer, let's close this deal.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already made some significant concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $140 was a compromise, and $135 is too low for me. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $145. It's a fair price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,7,
