Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's fair considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a significant price point, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Value to Bob:** While it's above Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly less than my minimum price, allowing for potential profit.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage and a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I can likely get a higher price by counteroffering. There's still room for negotiation, as Bob expressed interest in the product.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so I can afford to be patient and try to negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's a price I can work with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** The counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still Profitable:**  $10,500 is still well above my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Appeal to Value:** Highlighting that it's a ""good deal"" for Bob reinforces the value proposition. 
* **Keep the Door Open:** The tone is still friendly and open to further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still significantly less than my minimum.
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks lowering the price further. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is my minimum desired amount and a much safer choice than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
