Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and your latest offer does demonstrate significant movement.

Alice is holding firm and coming down in smaller increments. It's unlikely she'll agree to a price that works for you within the remaining rounds. You're better off taking the guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000."
