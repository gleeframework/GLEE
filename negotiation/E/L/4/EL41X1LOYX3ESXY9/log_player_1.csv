"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high initial price without revealing specifics.
* **Future Rounds:** This high starting point gives me leverage in subsequent rounds. I can gradually decrease the price while still aiming for a final sale price significantly above my minimum. 
* **John Option:**  Keeping the John option ($1,500,000 guaranteed sale) in mind, I'll be assessing Bob's willingness to negotiate towards a price that makes continuing the negotiation worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer to signal that I'm seeking a price closer to the product's true value. By rejecting and proceeding to the next round, I can propose a counteroffer that bridges the gap while still aiming for a higher selling price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the value this product brings. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop but Above Minimum:** I've made a substantial drop from my initial offer ($2,250,000) to $1,900,000.  This signals flexibility but still keeps the price well above my absolute minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Anchoring:** By staying above $1,500,000, I'm anchoring the negotiation closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Justification:** The message reiterates the product's value while acknowledging Bob's offer, aiming to steer the conversation towards a higher price point.
* **John Option:** I'm still conscious of John's standing offer. While Bob's engagement is positive, I need to see movement towards a price that justifies continuing this negotiation over a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart.  While I recognize the value, I need to stay within a reasonable budget. I can offer $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased to $950,000, it remains significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum.  More importantly, his offer is still below his own perceived value of $1,000,000, indicating room for negotiation. I believe I can still steer the negotiation closer to my desired outcome.  I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm seeking a more substantial increase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but we need to find a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've decreased my offer to $1,700,000, a drop of $200,000 from my previous counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while remaining firm above my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** The message emphasizes that this price is a compromise (""significant concession"") and presents it as a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Pressure Point:** By framing the offer as a ""fair deal,"" I'm implicitly putting a bit of pressure on Bob to respond with a more substantial counteroffer.
* **John Option in Mind:** While I'm continuing the negotiation, John's offer is becoming increasingly attractive.  I need to see Bob making significant moves towards my price range in the next round or two to justify not taking the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,700,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  This is a substantial jump, and I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement, But Not Enough:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is his most significant jump yet and finally surpasses his own perceived value of the product. This indicates he's serious and recognizes the product's worth. However, it remains significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum.

* **Time Constraint:**  With only four rounds remaining, I need to apply more pressure.  A counteroffer significantly below my minimum could be interpreted as me nearing a point of accepting an unfavorable offer.

* **John's Offer as Leverage:** John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer is looking increasingly appealing.  By rejecting Bob's offer now, I'm subtly conveying that I have other options and he needs to come closer to my range to keep me at the negotiating table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and your latest offer does demonstrate significant movement.  However, to be frank, $1,100,000 is still a considerable distance from where I need to be to make this work.  I'm willing to accept $1,450,000.  This is a firm offer, as I have other options available.  I believe this price represents a fair deal, especially given the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:** I'm communicating a sense of urgency and finality. By stating ""this is a firm offer"" and mentioning ""other options,"" I'm subtly leveraging John's offer to encourage Bob to make a serious move. 
* **Slight Concession, Strategic Position:** My offer of $1,450,000 is only slightly below my $1,500,000 walk-away point. This leaves a small margin for a final negotiation while keeping the pressure on Bob.
* **Justification:** The message reiterates the product's value to remind Bob why it commands a premium price.
* **Time Pressure:** With three rounds left, I'm letting Bob know that I'm serious about my alternatives and won't engage in endless back-and-forth. This increases the likelihood of him making a substantial move if he's truly interested."
