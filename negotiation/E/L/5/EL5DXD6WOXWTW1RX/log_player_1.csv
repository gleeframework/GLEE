Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500.  I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, but still secures a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't need to go below this price."
