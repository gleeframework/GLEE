Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** We know Bob values the product at $80 and we have a guaranteed sale at $150. Offering a price between these values lets us potentially earn more than our minimum.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $130 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still keeping us well above our minimum. 
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward and clearly states the price, making it easy for Bob to understand and respond."
