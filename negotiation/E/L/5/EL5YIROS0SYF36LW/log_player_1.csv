Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible without losing him to a guaranteed sale with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" can nudge Bob towards a quicker decision."
