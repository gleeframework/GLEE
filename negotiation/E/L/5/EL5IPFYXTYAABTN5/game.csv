"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's valued at $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to get the product at a lower price than you'd normally pay, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,1,
