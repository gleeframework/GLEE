"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1400000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down in price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, and I'm glad to hear that you think $1250000 is a fair price. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his ideal price, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  He should try to negotiate with Alice again, but if she doesn't come down further, he's better off buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think we can do better than $1275000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1275000 and $1300000, which is $1287500. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,287,500.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has come down in price, she's still asking more than what Bob can get from John.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice when he can get the product at a lower price from another seller."
