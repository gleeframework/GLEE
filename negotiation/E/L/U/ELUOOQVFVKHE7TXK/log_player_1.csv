"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in your product but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $120?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's not a bad deal, but since I have 10 rounds and I know the product is worth more to me than $120, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $135?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $135 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $125. Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $135, it's getting late in the negotiation and $125 is a decent price. It's also closer to my minimum than what John is offering, so it's a good deal."
