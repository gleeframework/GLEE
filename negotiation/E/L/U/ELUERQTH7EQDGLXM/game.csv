"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would really benefit you. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $100? That's a fair compromise, and it's within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $100 is still too low for me. How about $125?  That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
