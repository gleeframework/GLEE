"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $12,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, considering its value to me is around $12,000, I would like to propose a price of $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future. It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing out and having to sell to John for the same price."
