"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm starting the price at $140, but I'm open to discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a better price than John's offer, it's still above Bob's maximum value.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strong starting point for Bob.  It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the realm of what the product is worth to Bob.  This initial counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but also establishes a lower price point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's maximum value. Since he's already rejected her previous offer, there's room for further negotiation. Rejecting and making another counteroffer gives Bob the best chance to get the product at a price he's comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $135 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate strategically. He's shown a willingness to compromise, but he's still sticking to his price limit. Offering $130 is a fair compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward without pushing him beyond his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $132.50. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum of $120.  He has a better alternative in John, who is willing to sell for $120.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially get a better price, or to switch to John if he feels the negotiation isn't going in his favor.  

It's important for Bob to keep in mind that this is Alice's ""final offer.""  If he rejects, he risks Alice walking away from the deal completely. However, there's still a chance she might be willing to budge a little more if Bob makes a persuasive counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $132.50 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $128.  I truly believe this is a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a calculated risk by making a counteroffer despite Alice's declaration of a ""final offer."" However, he's showing flexibility and demonstrating his willingness to compromise. By offering $128, he's only slightly increasing his offer from the previous round, showing that he's not willing to go much higher.  This tactic might prompt Alice to reconsider her ""final offer"" and close the deal to avoid the risk of losing a potential sale entirely."
