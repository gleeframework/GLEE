"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum and well within your budget. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. ",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit away from $11,000. How about $10,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $10,900. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal!",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I want, but I still think $10,900 is a bit too high. How about $10,750 again? I'm willing to stick with this price, as it's already a good compromise for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,6,
