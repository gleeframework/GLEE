"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than his maximum budget, it's still a higher price than Alice's perceived value of $80.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90, which is still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target:**  $95 is closer to Bob's desired price point of $90 than Alice's initial offer of $100.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price. Alice might be firm on $95.
* **Time pressure:** 10 rounds is not a lot, and further negotiation could lead to running out of time, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $5 compared to buying from John. While it's not the ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise."
