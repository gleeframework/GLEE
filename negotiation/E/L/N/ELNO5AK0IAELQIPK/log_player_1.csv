Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, but I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to choose my offer over losing out on the product.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so I don't need to go below that.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is a price that offers Bob a significant discount while still giving me a good profit margin."
