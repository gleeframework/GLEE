"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is way too high.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is quite high.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't afford $1,000,000.  I'm willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. "", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it's closer to what I can afford. "", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value of the product to you and the value it holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as there's a chance I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $825,000.  This price is fair considering both our needs, and I believe it allows for a good outcome for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be realistic about the value of the product. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000, but I'm only willing to go that low because I think it's a good opportunity for both of us to reach a deal. I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is finally within my budget. Although it's still slightly higher than what I'd like to pay,  it's close enough to the value of the product to me, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds."
