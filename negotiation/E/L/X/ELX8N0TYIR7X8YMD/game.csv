"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway though.  How about $9,250?  That's a good compromise for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $8,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to go down to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider this offer?",8800.0,Bob,6,
