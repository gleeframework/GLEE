Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,250,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, the product's value remains higher than your current offer. To meet you halfway, I propose a price of $1,200,000.
