"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $115? That's a good compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I would like to propose a price of $105 for the product. This is my final offer.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $105 is closer, it's still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
