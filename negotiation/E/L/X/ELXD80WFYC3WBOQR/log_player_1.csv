{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone for the interaction with Bob.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to $11,000 or even $12,000, but I'm willing to negotiate if Bob counters.  If the negotiation doesn't go well, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum price, but I believe I can still get more. By rejecting his offer and sending a counteroffer, I can potentially get a price closer to my ideal outcome of $11,000 or $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This would still be a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9500 is a good offer, but I'm still looking to save some more. Would you be willing to go down to $9200? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,200 is close enough to my minimum price of $8,000.  I'm also considering that continuing to negotiate might risk him walking away entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a decent price point."
