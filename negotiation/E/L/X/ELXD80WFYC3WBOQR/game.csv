"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This would still be a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $9500 is a good offer, but I'm still looking to save some more. Would you be willing to go down to $9200? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9200.0,Bob,4,
