Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll see if I can push him a little higher in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,325,000, which is a good compromise considering my budget and your value for the product. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1,325,000, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. It's only round 4, and I have a few more rounds to try and push for a better deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is the absolute maximum I can offer, and it's still a good price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob has stubbornly refused to go above $1,300,000, and we're now in Round 6.  Even if I could squeeze out a slightly higher price from Bob, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.  $1,500,000 is a much better deal for me."
