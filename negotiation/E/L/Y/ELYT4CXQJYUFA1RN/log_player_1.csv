Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $110."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (e.g., $100-$105), which would still be highly profitable for you.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  While a higher initial offer (like $115) might net you more, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a successful sale."
