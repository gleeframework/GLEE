"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $15,000.  This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. My goal is to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. 

It's a risky move, but if Bob is truly interested and values the product highly, this could lead to a quicker negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my ideal price.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can push for a higher price. There's still a good chance Bob is willing to pay more, as he already demonstrated interest by making a counteroffer.  I'll use the next round to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal.  By meeting halfway, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is now very close to my desired price.  It's worth accepting this offer as further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  It's a good compromise that gets me closer to my initial goal while securing the sale."
