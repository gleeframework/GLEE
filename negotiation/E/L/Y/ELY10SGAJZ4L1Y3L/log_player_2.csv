"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit below my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $10800. This is a good middle ground that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also considering my minimum requirement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $10,800 is still higher than Bob's preferred price of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open for a better price.  Since Bob has the option of buying from John for $10,000, he has leverage to push for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,800 is closer, I'm still not quite there. My final offer is $10,200. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that $10200 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10200 and my initial offer of $11000. I'm thinking of a price of $10600. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also considering my minimum requirement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,600 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for his target price, it's more advantageous to end the negotiation with Alice and buy from John.  This ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price and avoids further rounds of potentially unsuccessful negotiation."
