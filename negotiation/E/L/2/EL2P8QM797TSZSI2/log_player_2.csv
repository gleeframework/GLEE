"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly higher than her own valuation of $800,000. This indicates there's potential for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $750,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still higher than her own valuation of $800,000.  This means she still has room to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer allows Bob to continue to try and lower the price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not ready to accept $825,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $837,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target:**  The price of $837,500 is only $7,500 more than Bob's last counteroffer, and significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice getting frustrated and walking away from the deal, forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price.

At this point, accepting the offer represents a good balance between achieving a lower price and minimizing the risk of missing out on the deal entirely."
