"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This unique item is worth $1,500,000 to you, and my proposal aims to strike a balance between our interests. I am offering you the chance to own this masterpiece at a price of $1,350,000. This offer not only allows you to secure a significant piece at a competitive price but also ensures that you won't miss out on a potential investment opportunity. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, it's still higher than what you could get it for from John. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away unless the price is more favorable. This puts you in a stronger negotiating position."
