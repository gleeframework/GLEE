Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."

I'm lowering my price, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear floor for my price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below where I want to be. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm dropping the price a bit further, showing flexibility while still holding onto a sizable profit. I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, especially since John is offering a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a safer and more profitable option for me."
