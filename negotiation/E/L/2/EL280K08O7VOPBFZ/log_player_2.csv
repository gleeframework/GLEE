"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $800,000 to me, but I believe it holds even greater value for someone like you. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a price that reflects its true potential while still allowing me to achieve a fair return.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, you can get the product for a better price from John. There's no harm in rejecting her offer and seeing if she'll come down further."
