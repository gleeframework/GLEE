"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its features and value, I'm offering it at $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This is my best offer and a fair price for such a high-quality product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  I could consider a price closer to $12,000 if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $15,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair deal for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I'm still finding it hard to justify going above $13,000 for this product. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",13000.0,Bob,6,
