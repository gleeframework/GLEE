Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a fair compromise and a reasonable price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Explanation: While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000.  At this point, the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John is the better business decision to avoid further negotiation and potential loss."
