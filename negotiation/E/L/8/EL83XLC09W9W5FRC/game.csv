"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking for a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go higher than $11,500.  This is a fair compromise considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  $12,200 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. How about $11,800?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with. Let's close this out!",11800.0,Bob,8,
