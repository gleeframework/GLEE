"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,500.  What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $13,750?  It's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you!",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm really keen on your product, but $13,750 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,625? It's a fair compromise and allows both of us to get a good deal.",13625.0,Bob,4,
