"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000. This is a good price, but Bob can likely do better.
* **Alternative:**  Buying from John for $15,000 is still an option, but Bob should try to get a better deal from Alice first.

**Strategy:**  Reject Alice's offer and counter with a lower price. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and encourages further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save money.
* **Counteroffer:** $13,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Strategy:**  Show Alice that Bob is willing to negotiate and is serious about buying the product, but also wants a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $13,750?  It's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,750. This is a compromise, but Bob is still looking to save more.
* **Alternative:** Buying from John for $15,000 is still an option, but Bob can likely negotiate a better deal with Alice.

**Strategy:**  Reject Alice's offer and counter again with a slightly lower price.  This shows that Bob is determined to get the best possible price and that he isn't rushing into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really keen on your product, but $13,750 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,625? It's a fair compromise and allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13625}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money.
* **Counteroffer:** $13,625. This is a small decrease from Alice's offer, but it demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategy:**  The goal here is to be reasonable but firm in pursuing a price closer to Bob's desired price point. The counteroffer is a small step towards a potential agreement, and it also leaves room for Alice to counter if she needs to."
