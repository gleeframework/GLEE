"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while still staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $850,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle somewhat?  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $1,025,000, but that's still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations is still significant. While I'm open to negotiation, I can't go as low as $950,000.  My final offer is $995,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's true value.",995000.0,Alice,5,
