"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. I believe it's a perfect fit for your needs and will bring you significant value. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
