"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to move closer to your figure. How about $1,275,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my figure. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,275,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,225,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence.  I understand your position but I need to be closer to my original ask.  Would you consider $1,250,000?  This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $1,250,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,225,000 and $1,250,000, which would be $1,237,500. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",1237500.0,Bob,6,
