"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've been thinking, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision to purchase it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($1,200,000), but still below your maximum budget ($1,500,000). There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.
