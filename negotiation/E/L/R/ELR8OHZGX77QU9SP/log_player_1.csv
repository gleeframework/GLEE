"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  We start significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and even above our own minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximized profit. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""unique value and potential,"" subtly implying there's more to the product than Bob might realize, justifying the high initial price.
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a backup buyer gives us leverage. We're not desperate to make a deal with Bob at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, but I'm not willing to go any higher.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both our minimum and his own perceived value. While he's signaling a firm limit, we have room to negotiate and John as a safety net. Accepting now would leave a lot of money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant drop from our initial price ($300,000) to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. However, we're still aiming high above both our minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Reaffirming Value:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly countering Bob's attempt to anchor the negotiation at a low price.
* **Time Consideration:**  We have time on our side. While we want to close the deal, rushing into a low acceptance isn't necessary with John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is holding firm at $1,000,000, showing little movement from his initial stance. 
* **Testing the Waters:** We need to see if he's truly unwilling to budge beyond this point or if it's a negotiation tactic.
* **John as Leverage:**  We're not desperate. Rejecting this offer and presenting a counter closer to our minimum will reveal more about Bob's flexibility. We can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I also need to be mindful of the value of this product. Let's find a compromise. How about we meet halfway at $1,450,000? This represents a significant movement from my last offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding an agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Move, Strategic Position:** We're making a substantial drop from $1,900,000 to $1,450,000. This shows flexibility and a desire to close the deal but keeps us comfortably above both Bob's offer and our absolute minimum. 
* **Anchoring and Compromise:** By suggesting a ""halfway"" point, we're subtly re-anchoring the negotiation closer to our desired range. Even if Bob rejects this, it sets a frame for future offers.
* **Time and Leverage:** We're now halfway through our rounds. This offer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He either needs to show some movement, or we can seriously consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which is a significant move from my previous offer.  I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement, But Not Enough:** Bob is finally moving off his firm $1,000,000 stance, offering $1,200,000. This shows our tactics are working, and he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Potential Upside Remains:** While $1,200,000 is tempting, we're still leaving a significant amount on the table compared to John's guaranteed $1,500,000.
* **Time for a Calculated Risk:** We have four rounds left. We can apply a bit more pressure and see if Bob is willing to move closer to the $1,450,000 mark. If he's not budging in the next round or two, we can then accept his offer or go with John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise and reflects the value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Concessions, Maintaining Upper Hand:** We're reducing our price by another $100,000, showing continued willingness to negotiate but in smaller increments. This keeps the momentum going without conceding too much at once.
* **Psychological Advantage:** By staying above $1,300,000, we're aiming for a price where Bob might feel he's getting a ""win"" if he can push us down slightly, even though it's still a very favorable deal for us.
* **Time Awareness:**  We're getting closer to the end of our negotiation window. This offer keeps the pressure on Bob while leaving us with options if he remains inflexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, $1,350,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which represents a good compromise and a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:** While we could likely push for a bit more, we're running out of rounds. Accepting now secures a significant profit ($1,250,000) and avoids the risk of Bob stalling or us having to settle for John's offer at the last minute. 
* **Strong Negotiation Position:** We've successfully moved Bob up significantly from his initial offer.  $1,250,000 is a good outcome, even if it's not the absolute maximum we could have gotten.
* **Certainty and Efficiency:**  A bird in hand is worth two in the bush. Closing the deal now eliminates uncertainty and potential delays that could arise from further negotiation."
