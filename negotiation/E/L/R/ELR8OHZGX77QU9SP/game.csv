,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, but I'm not willing to go any higher.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I also need to be mindful of the value of this product. Let's find a compromise. How about we meet halfway at $1,450,000? This represents a significant movement from my last offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which is a significant move from my previous offer.  I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise and reflects the value of this product.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, $1,350,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which represents a good compromise and a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's close the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
