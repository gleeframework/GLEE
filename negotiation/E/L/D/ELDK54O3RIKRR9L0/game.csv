"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe it will be very valuable to you. It's worth $1,000,000 to you, so this is a great opportunity to acquire it at a price that's still a good deal for you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
