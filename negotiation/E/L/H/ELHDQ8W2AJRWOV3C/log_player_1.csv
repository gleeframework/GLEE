Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for more negotiation room.
* **Room for Compromise:** I'm confident in the value of my product, so even if Bob counters at a lower price, I have room to negotiate down without reaching my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me confidence to push for a better price. 

I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, but I'm not desperate. This approach aims to maximize my profit while keeping open the option to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still below my ideal value. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's interested in the product.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe option, but I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Confidence:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price of $1,350,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong position.
* **Value Perception:**  Bob's counteroffer suggests he values the product closer to $1,200,000.  My counteroffer acknowledges his perspective while pushing for a higher price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not willing to drop to Bob's initial offer, but I'm open to finding a middle ground. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum price point.

By offering $1,350,000, I hope to find a mutually agreeable price that satisfies both our needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the Goal:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my desired price range. It's only $50,000 less than my previous offer, which shows that we're getting closer to an agreement.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a lower offer from Bob, or even a stalemate. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate might take longer and ultimately result in a lower price than Bob's current offer. 

While I would have preferred a price closer to $1,350,000, accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of a lower offer in the future and secures a respectable profit."
