Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I believe it will be very valuable for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to aim slightly below that to entice Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $119 puts you just below your guaranteed price while still potentially securing a higher profit than selling to John. This creates a sense of urgency and a good deal for Bob. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is friendly and leaves room for Bob to respond, potentially opening up further negotiation if he counter-offers."
