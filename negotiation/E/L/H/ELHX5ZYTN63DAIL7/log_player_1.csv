Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum value.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's far below my minimum value.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000.  This is my absolute minimum, so I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway.  If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough. I'm hoping I can get him to go higher with a counteroffer, but if not, I'll finally sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $11,000. This is still a good price for me and I think it might be enough to get him to accept.  If he rejects, I'll finally go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging. He's clearly not willing to pay what the product is worth to me. I've tried negotiating, but it's not going anywhere. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  I'm guaranteed $12,000, which is more than Bob is offering."
