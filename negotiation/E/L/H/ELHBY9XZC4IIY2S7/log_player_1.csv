"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe holds tremendous value. My initial asking price is $1,800,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:** Starting with a high price ($1,800,000) allows for room for negotiation. It signals to Bob that the product is valuable and that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Positive message:** Expressing excitement and confidence in the value of the product sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:**  Mentioning a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" emphasizes that I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. 

This approach aims to start the negotiation strong and leaves room to potentially lower the price in subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my value for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Selling to John at this point would be a better option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range with Bob.  I will reject his offer and try to counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which reflects the product's significant value and allows for room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledges Bob's budget:** Shows understanding of his constraints while maintaining firmness on my own terms.
* **Counter with a reduced price:** Offers a significant reduction from the initial price, but still above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Focuses on mutual benefit:** Re-emphasizes the desire for a win-win scenario, hoping to encourage further negotiation. 

By taking a step towards Bob's offer but maintaining a price above my minimum, I aim to show flexibility while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1000000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still below my desired value.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price. Selling to John at this point would be a better option, but I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1,000,000 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part and shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's come to an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's effort:**  Start by acknowledging his increased offer to show respect and maintain a positive negotiation tone.
* **State your reasoning:** Clearly explain why his offer is still insufficient, focusing on your own needs and the value of the product.
* **Propose a compromise:** Offer a counter that is closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  
* **Highlight mutual benefit:**  Again, emphasize the desire for a solution that works for both parties. 
* **Urgency:**  Suggesting reaching an agreement in this round adds a touch of pressure to encourage a response.

This approach aims to find a middle ground while keeping the pressure on Bob to make a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1100000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this agreement in this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  We are running out of time, and while I'd like to continue negotiating,  the risk of not reaching a satisfactory price with Bob is too high.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees a better deal for me at this point."
