,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my value for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1400000, which reflects the product's significant value and allows for room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1000000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1000000 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. This reflects a significant concession on my part and shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's come to an agreement in this round.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1100000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this agreement in this round.",950000.0,Bob,6,
