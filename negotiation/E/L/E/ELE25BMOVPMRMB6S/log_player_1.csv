I'm starting with a price of $9,000.  This gives me a $1,000 profit over John's offer, but it's still a significant amount for Bob to potentially gain.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll have to settle for John's offer, but I'll still make a good profit."
