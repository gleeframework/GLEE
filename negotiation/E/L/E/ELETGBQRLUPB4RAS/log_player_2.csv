"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I have to consider the value of the product to me as well. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit higher than my ideal target.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I'm getting closer to my target price, I'm still hoping to get it for closer to $800,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap a bit more."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm now offering the product to you for $825000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is only $25,000 more than my last counteroffer.  I'm not sure I can get a much better price, and I'm running out of rounds. It's worth accepting the offer and saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
