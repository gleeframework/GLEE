"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $6,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,250 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a new counteroffer of $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
