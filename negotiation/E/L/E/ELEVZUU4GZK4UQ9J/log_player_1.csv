Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $750,000? That feels like a fair starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer, we're still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to hold firm for now and see if he'll budge further.  We're getting into a range where I need to consider John more seriously, but I'll risk another round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase, and I respect that. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  However, I believe in finding the right fit. My final offer is $865,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it situation."",
""product_price"": 865000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by mentioning John (""another buyer""). This might push Bob to act.
* **Finality:**  Stating ""final offer"" removes ambiguity and lets Bob know this is my bottom line.
* **Slight Concession:** Coming down a small amount ($15,000) shows flexibility but not desperation. 

I'm hoping this either closes the deal or lets me walk away to John without leaving too much money on the table."
