Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  By emphasizing the value to him, I'm hoping to make the offer more appealing. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer, John, who is willing to pay my minimum. This gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I have John as a backup buyer, so I don't need to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,500?  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us to be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum of $12,000.  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher.  It's better to secure a sale at $9,000 than to risk losing him and having to sell to John at a lower price."
