Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $70, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer you the product for $72.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the value.

 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and call it $71?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the idea of splitting the difference, Bob, but I'm not quite comfortable with $71. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer you the product for $72. It's a small step closer to your target, and I think it's still a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $72 is a reasonable price, saving $8 compared to buying from John. Holding out for a slightly better deal with Alice isn't worth the risk of her increasing the price or the deal falling through."
