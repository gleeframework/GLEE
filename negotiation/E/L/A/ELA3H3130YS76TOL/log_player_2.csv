"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $9,500. I believe this product would be highly beneficial for you, and this offer represents a great value considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's valuation, but still leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Reasonable Counter:**  Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but higher than her valuation, potentially leading to a quick agreement. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message conveys that Bob is willing to negotiate and encourages Alice to counter if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is a compromise that brings the price closer to Bob's target. 
* **Better than John:**  $9,000 is still less expensive than buying from John for $10,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another offer and having to buy from John makes accepting the offer the most logical choice in this situation."
