"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to both of us. This product, which I believe is worth more than $1,500,000 to you, is now being offered to you at a special price. My proposal is to sell this product to you for $1,200,000. This price not only ensures a significant return for me but also allows you to secure an asset that aligns perfectly with your needs and aspirations. I am confident that this offer represents a fair and advantageous deal for both parties. Should you be interested in proceeding, please let me know, and we can arrange the necessary steps for a smooth transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is tempting, it's crucial to remember your goal: buy the product while saving as much money as possible. You have a backup option with John at $1,500,000. 

Here's why rejecting Alice's offer makes sense:

* **Negotiating Power:**  Alice is highly motivated to sell. Her product is only worth $800,000 to her, and she's aiming for a significant profit. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're a serious buyer but not willing to overpay. This puts you in a strong position to negotiate a lower price. 

* **Risk vs. Reward:** The worst-case scenario is you have to buy from John at $1,500,000. However, there's a good chance you can get Alice to lower her price closer to your budget by rejecting this initial offer."
