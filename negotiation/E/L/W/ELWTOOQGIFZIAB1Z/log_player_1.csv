Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but still offer an appealing price to Bob. 
* **Beat Bob's Value:** Offering it slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) gives him a chance to get it at a price he might find acceptable, while still earning you a significant profit.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Why not higher?:**  While we could try a price closer to $150, it's riskier.  Bob is more likely to reject the offer outright, forcing us to settle for the guaranteed $150 from John."
