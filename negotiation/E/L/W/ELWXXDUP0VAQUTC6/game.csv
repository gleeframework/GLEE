"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a bit.  Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the interest, but my budget is limited. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $7,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet the price of $8,500. Would it be possible for us to negotiate further? I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",8000.0,Bob,4,
