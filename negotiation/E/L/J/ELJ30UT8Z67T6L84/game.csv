"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, $11500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11000. This is a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefit. Let's find a middle ground here.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $10750 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to drop to $11250, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
