"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are trying to save as much money as possible, and $11,500 is still above your limit. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, $11,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11000. This is a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefit. Let's find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still aiming for a price closer to your $10,000 limit.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $10,750 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $10750 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to drop to $11250, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, you're now at a point where it's likely you'll continue to be stuck at a price higher than your budget. It's better to go with the guaranteed $10,000 price from John at this point."
