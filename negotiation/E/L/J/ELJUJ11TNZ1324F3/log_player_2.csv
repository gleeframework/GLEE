"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but we're willing to start negotiations at $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down closer to my budget. I'm willing to risk a few rounds to see if I can get a better deal than $80 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $60?"", 
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to move. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below her initial offer and my $80 fallback option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. We appreciate your feedback. To better align with your budget, how about we meet halfway between our prices at $75? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but $75 is still more than I want to pay. I'll try countering a little higher to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm keeping John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $68? That's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 68
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm inching closer to her price while still staying below my $80 limit. This shows I'm serious but also sets a firm boundary. If she doesn't budge much from here, I'll likely go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. Considering the value of the product and aiming for mutual benefit, how does $72 sound as a compromise? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to meet me halfway, but $72 is still too close to my $80 limit.  I'll make one more counteroffer, but if she doesn't accept, I'll go with John.  It's not worth the risk of going over budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $70 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that works, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is my final offer. It's a firm but fair compromise.  It saves me $10 off John's price and hopefully ends the negotiation successfully.  If Alice rejects it, I'll buy from John to avoid overspending."
