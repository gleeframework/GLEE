"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is $14,000, which is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** Bob is starting his negotiation by offering a price lower than Alice's initial offer but still within his budget.
* **Message:** Bob expresses interest in the product while remaining firm on his desire for a lower price. This establishes a friendly yet assertive tone for the negotiation.
* **Price:**  The offer of $13,000 is a significant step towards Bob's goal of saving as much money as possible. It also leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the Middle:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer. This suggests she's willing to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Budget:** The price of $13,500 is still within Bob's budget of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  If Bob rejects this offer and continues negotiating, he risks losing the opportunity to buy the product at a good price.  He might end up paying more to John or the negotiation could fall apart entirely.

By accepting the offer, Bob achieves his goal of buying the product while saving $1,500 compared to buying from John."
