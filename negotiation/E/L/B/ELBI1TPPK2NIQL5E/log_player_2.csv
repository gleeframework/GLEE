"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1400000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm confident that this is a great starting point. What do you think?

I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than you're offering.
