"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1400000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm confident that this is a great starting point. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. I would like to counter with a price of $1350000. I hope this proposal aligns better with my budget while still reflecting the product's worth to me.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm going to counter with a price of $1380000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1380000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1360000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the product's value to me and your expectations.",1360000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not convinced that $1360000 is enough to reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm going to counter with a price of $1390000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1390000.0,Alice,5,
