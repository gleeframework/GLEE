"Hi Alice, $180 is definitely too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you do $140? That would be a fair compromise.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's meet in the middle.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go as low as $100.  How about $120? That's my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
