"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,000. This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price point. There's room for further negotiation, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going."
