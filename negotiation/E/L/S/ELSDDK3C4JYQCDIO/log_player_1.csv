{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $11,500 is higher than Bob's $10,000 valuation, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $11,500 is still below your minimum of $12,000, so you're still making a profit.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** This price gives Bob a solid starting point for his potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. I'll try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,000. This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible. $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $10,750. It's a fair compromise and a good value for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $10,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my goal. I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob, especially considering I already have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $12,000."
