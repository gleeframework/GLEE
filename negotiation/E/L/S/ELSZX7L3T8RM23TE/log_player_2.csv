Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $60 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. Could you meet me halfway at $90?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $82.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price, and we're running out of rounds. While she might eventually go lower than $80, it's not worth the risk. Buying from John guarantees we get the product at our target price."
