"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice to get a lower price. $140 is close to your limit, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $132? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $132 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  I'll try to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $132 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on getting this product, and I'm willing to pay $130.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 130}
