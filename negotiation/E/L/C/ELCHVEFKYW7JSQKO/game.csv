"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $60 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $100. This still gives you a good deal on a valuable product, and it's closer to what I need to make it worth my while. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
