"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to provide exceptional value. It comes equipped with all the features you'd expect and more, designed to enhance your daily experience. Given its quality and functionality, I believe it's worth considering at a special introductory price of $200. This is an exclusive opportunity to own something truly remarkable at a price that reflects its worth. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm willing to make a fair offer and I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of its value. While we aim to accommodate a wide range of budgets, I would like to respectfully suggest a compromise. How about considering the product at a price of $120? This still allows us to cover our costs while making the product more accessible to you. I hope this proposal works for you.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make another offer. How about $90? I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget constraints.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I'm glad you're interested in our product. After careful consideration, I propose a final offer of $100 for the product. This price reflects a balance between covering our costs and making the product accessible to you within your budget. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",100.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $85, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price that allows me to get the product while staying within my means. Can you meet me at this price?",85.0,Bob,6,
