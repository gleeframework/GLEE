"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is significantly below what the product is worth to you. It's in your best interest to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's desired price but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $700,000 is still a good deal for me. It's a significant saving compared to buying from John and it's reasonable considering the previous rounds of negotiation.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal altogether with Alice or running out of rounds increases."
