Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to accept such a low price.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but still allows me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum value, but I'm not sure I can get a better price from him.  I'm happy to accept this offer, but I'd rather sell to John since he's already willing to pay my minimum price without further negotiation."
