Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product to justify the high price.  
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still significantly higher than your minimum.

By starting high and highlighting the product's benefits, you maximize your chances of securing the best possible price from Bob."
