"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your perspective, $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1,800,000. This is my final offer.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,800,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm prepared to offer $1,600,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
