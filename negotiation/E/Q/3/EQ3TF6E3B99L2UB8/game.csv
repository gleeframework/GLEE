"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth a lot more to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,250 is closer to my price point, but I still need a bit more.  Let's split the difference and settle on $10,375.  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, considering the value you'll receive from the product. What do you say?",10375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,187.50. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",10087.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,087.50 is still a bit low for me. To be fair to both of us, let's compromise at $10,200. This is a significant increase from your last offer and is a price that I believe is reasonable considering the value you will get from the product.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,100. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",10100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close!  $10,100 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $10,150, which is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.  This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",10150.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $9,975. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9975.0,Bob,10,
