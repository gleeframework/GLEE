"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I'm looking for something closer to $1,100,000. This still offers a great value for you and allows me to reach a more comfortable price point.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my previous offer. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This is still a good deal for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the transaction. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
