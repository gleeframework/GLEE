"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. $500,000 is far too low for me.  I am confident we can reach a better price that benefits both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is significantly below what I need to consider.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me.  How about we try $650,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and gives us some more room to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $650,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still far too low for me.  I'm going to counter again and see if we can come closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $650,000 is still not enough for me. Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to reach a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
