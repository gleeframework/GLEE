"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $900000 is too far below what I need to accept.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This still reflects the value of the product while recognizing your budgetary constraints.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I'm still not able to meet at $1200000. I would like to propose $1050000 as a compromise. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
