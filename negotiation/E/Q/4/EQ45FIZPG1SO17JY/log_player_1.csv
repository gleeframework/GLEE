Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message:** It's friendly but firm, highlighting the product's uniqueness and presenting a fair price. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:**  I want to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I'm prepared to go lower, but I want Bob to come to me.
* **Highlight the value:**  I want Bob to understand the product's worth, making him more likely to accept a higher price.

This is just the first step. I will need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, and potentially make counteroffers or end the negotiation and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $900000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price at this point.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $900,000 is too far below what I need to accept.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still reflects the value of the product while recognizing your budgetary constraints."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes my willingness to compromise and highlights the product's value while acknowledging Bob's constraints.  

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain a firm position:** I won't go below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Show flexibility:**  The counteroffer shows I'm open to negotiation.
* **Stay optimistic:** I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I'm still not able to meet at $1200000. I would like to propose $1050000 as a compromise. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I initially hoped for a higher price, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to go significantly higher.  It's a good deal, and I'm better off accepting his offer rather than risking further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
