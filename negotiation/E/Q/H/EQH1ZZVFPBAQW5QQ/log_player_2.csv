# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $8,200 is a good deal compared to John's $10,000 price."
