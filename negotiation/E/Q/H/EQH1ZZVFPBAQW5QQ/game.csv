"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,200.
