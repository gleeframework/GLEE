"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and Bob's offer is exactly at that price, I'd rather not risk going lower. I'll choose option 1 and accept Bob's offer.
