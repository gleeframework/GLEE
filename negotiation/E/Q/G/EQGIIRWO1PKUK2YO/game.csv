"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer and reflects the value I place on this product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
