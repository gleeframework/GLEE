Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation if he rejects. This strategy aims to:

* **Get a good price:** $9,500 is closer to my minimum value of $10,000. 
* **Encourage negotiation:**  Leaving room for negotiation gives Bob a reason to engage and potentially increase his offer.
* **Maintain leverage:** If Bob rejects, I can still use the threat of selling to John for $10,000 as a bargaining chip."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum desired value of $10,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  I can use the threat of selling to John for $10,000 to pressure Bob into a higher offer.
* **Explore a better deal:**  I can try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round. 
* **Assess Bob's true interest:**  Seeing how far he's willing to go will give me a better understanding of his real budget and negotiation potential."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  It shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Still above my minimum:** $9,000 is still closer to my desired value of $10,000 than Bob's offer.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  By not immediately accepting his offer, I leave open the possibility of a slightly higher counteroffer from Bob, if he's truly interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8750 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's latest offer of $8,750 is closer to my desired value than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum. I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're nearing a stalemate.  

Selling to John for $10,000 is the most beneficial option in this scenario:

* **Guaranteed profit:**  This ensures I get my minimum desired value.
* **Time efficiency:**  Further negotiation with Bob might take more time and energy, potentially leading to a lower price or no deal at all.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While a final counteroffer from Bob might be possible, there's no guarantee he'll come up to my minimum value.  Selling to John removes the uncertainty and secures a definite profit."
