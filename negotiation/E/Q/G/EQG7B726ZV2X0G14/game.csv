"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1000000 is significantly lower than what I need, I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm prepared to accept $1750000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1250000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
