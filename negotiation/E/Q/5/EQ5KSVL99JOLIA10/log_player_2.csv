"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm confident it's worth more than $150 to you. Considering this, I'd like to propose an offer of $200 for the product. This price reflects not only its intrinsic value but also the opportunity for you to enjoy its benefits at a slightly higher cost than its market value. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer.  It makes the most sense to go with John's offer and save the $50."
