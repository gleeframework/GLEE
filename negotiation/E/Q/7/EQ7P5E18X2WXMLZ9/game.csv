,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,000,000? This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you've mentioned. Let's make this work!",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss $950,000? That's the highest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $950,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further.  How about we go with $975,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value you've indicated, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, and that's my final offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there. I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $960,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $970,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you see in the product. Let's finalize this deal.",970000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $970,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $955,000, and that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to be able to come to an agreement, so I hope we can find a way to make this work.",955000.0,Bob,8,
