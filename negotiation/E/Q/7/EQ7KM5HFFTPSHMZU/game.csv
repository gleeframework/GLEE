"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's uniqueness and my initial offer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to you: I'll sell the product to you for $1150000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one last counteroffer of $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept the offer. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
