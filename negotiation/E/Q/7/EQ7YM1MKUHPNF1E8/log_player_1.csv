Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1625000. Can we make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would love to keep negotiating, Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for.  I'm confident that I can get more from another buyer, but the risk of continuing to negotiate and ultimately having to sell to John for $1,500,000 is too high.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
