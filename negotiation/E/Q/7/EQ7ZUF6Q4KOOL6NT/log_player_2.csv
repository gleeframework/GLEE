It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We're near Alice's limit:**  Alice has consistently indicated that she's close to her minimum price.  Continuing to push too hard could make her walk away.
* **Good Price:** $1,115,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price. 
* **Time:**  We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds.  While we might squeeze out a tiny bit more, the risk of losing the deal isn't worth it."
