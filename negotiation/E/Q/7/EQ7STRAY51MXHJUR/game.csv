"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it will be worth far more than the price I'm asking. I'm starting with $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget is set at $800000. I believe this is a fair price given the market conditions and the potential benefits to my business. Would you consider accepting this counteroffer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is simply not a viable option for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1200000? I believe this price is still fair given the potential benefits of the product. ",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given the current market conditions and my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. This price reflects a compromise between our positions and I believe it would be beneficial for both parties involved.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're both trying to find common ground here.  $900000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. Considering the ongoing negotiations and aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. This price is reflective of the market value and aligns closely with your initial offer. I hope this proposal will lead us to a successful conclusion.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
