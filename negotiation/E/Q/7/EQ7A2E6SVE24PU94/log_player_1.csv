Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $13,000. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to his valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $13,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I still have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John.

This strategy aims to secure a significant profit while acknowledging that pushing too close to Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) could make him walk away."
