Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you need to come down.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will tell you a lot about his eagerness and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed backup who will pay your minimum price. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
