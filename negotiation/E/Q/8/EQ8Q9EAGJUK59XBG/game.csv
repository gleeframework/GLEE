"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we start the negotiations at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. It's significantly below the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth.  Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $1,125,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,125,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. This is my final offer. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
