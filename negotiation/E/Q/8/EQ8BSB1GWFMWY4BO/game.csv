"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $500000 for the product, but I'm not going to go any higher.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which is still a great deal for a product of this value.  Let's meet in the middle.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a certain price, but $1750000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $700000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my needs.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you are trying to reach a compromise, but $700000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1600000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I truly believe this product will be worth every penny for you.  Let's work towards a final agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting the feeling we might not be able to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to go up to $750000 for the product, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",750000.0,Bob,6,
