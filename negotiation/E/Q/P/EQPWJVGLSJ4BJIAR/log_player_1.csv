Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to earn at least $120 (your value from John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product between $120 and $150 allows for profit.  A price closer to $150 maximizes your potential earnings.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $145 leaves a slight buffer for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down."
