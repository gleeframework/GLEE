"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and my initial offer reflects that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I still think that's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good deal. It's significantly more than my minimum ($800,000) and a decent compromise from my initial ask.  There's always a risk Bob will walk away if I counter again."
