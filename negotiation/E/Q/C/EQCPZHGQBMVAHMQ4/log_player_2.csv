{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. You can do better.  You have rounds to negotiate and can even buy from John if you don't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

You're offering $8,500, which is still a bit higher than your ideal price, but it's a significant drop from Alice's offer. You are showing willingness to negotiate and might be able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer again. While it's closer to your ideal price, you still have rounds to negotiate and could potentially get it even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
``` 

You're increasing your offer slightly to $8,750. This shows that you're serious about buying the product but are still holding firm on your limit. This could entice Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. It's only slightly higher than your ideal price, and you have more rounds to potentially negotiate a lower price.  While buying from John is a safe option, you're almost there with Alice!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250}
```

You're taking a bold move here and lowering the price to $8,250. This shows Alice you are determined to get a deal close to your ideal price.  It could either lead to Alice accepting, or to her rejecting and counteroffering.  Since you are nearing the end of your rounds, this is a risky, but potentially rewarding, move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  While you'd ideally pay $8,000, you are very close to that price with only 3 rounds left.  It's likely that Alice won't go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely if you reject.  The remaining rounds are not enough to likely get a better deal."
