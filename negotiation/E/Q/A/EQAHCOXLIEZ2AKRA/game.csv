"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $11,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you're open to discussing.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is quite high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  $10,250 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm happy to pay $9,750, which is closer to the middle ground. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  $9,750 is cutting it very close to my minimum.  How about we settle at an even $10,000?  This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
