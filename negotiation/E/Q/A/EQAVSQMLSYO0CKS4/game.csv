"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I want to start with a price that reflects its true value to me. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer you $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and your budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and hopefully shows my sincerity in reaching an agreement. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still $300,000 below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $975,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and your budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. To be honest, I'm really pushing my budget here.  Let's try $925,000. This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal.  What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're pushing your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $975,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $950,000, which is $25,000 above your latest offer. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $950,000 is still slightly more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $937,500, which represents a significant compromise on my part. This offer is almost a perfect split between our previous positions. Let's find a way to make this work.",937500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll sell it to you for $975,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 5. I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,9,
