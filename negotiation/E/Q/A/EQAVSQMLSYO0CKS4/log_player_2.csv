"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I want to start with a price that reflects its true value to me. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. It is in your best interest to reject and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer you $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and your budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to your budget, it's still too high. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and hopefully shows my sincerity in reaching an agreement. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still $300,000 below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $975,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and your budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to your budget, $975,000 is still too high.  You have a good chance of getting a better price with continued negotiation. You can afford to keep negotiating with Alice, as you can still purchase from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. To be honest, I'm really pushing my budget here.  Let's try $925,000. This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're pushing your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $975,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $950,000, which is $25,000 above your latest offer. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your budget. You have a few rounds left to try and get a lower price. You're only $50,000 away from your previous offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate a little further to see if you can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $950,000 is still slightly more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $937,500, which represents a significant compromise on my part. This offer is almost a perfect split between our previous positions. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 937500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll sell it to you for $975,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 5. I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is refusing to budge from her previous offer, and you're running out of rounds. At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000.  You're unlikely to get Alice to go lower, and you're close to your budget limit."
