"That's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $10,500. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,500? This would allow me to purchase the product and still stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to be honest with you, Bob, I've had another interested buyer who is willing to pay the full price. I'm giving you a chance to match that offer, but I need to know you're serious about buying the product at this price. Can you commit to $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
