"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget of $8,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""That's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $10,500. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still above Bob's comfort zone. Bob wants to save as much as possible, and the $8,000 option from John is always a possibility. There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting and counter-offering again is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,500? This would allow me to purchase the product and still stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to be honest with you, Bob, I've had another interested buyer who is willing to pay the full price. I'm giving you a chance to match that offer, but I need to know you're serious about buying the product at this price. Can you commit to $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $8,000. Even though she's using a bit of pressure with the other buyer, Bob has a solid alternative with John.  It's time to cut his losses and secure the product for $8,000 rather than risking further negotiation and potentially losing out to the other buyer."
