"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be happy to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth a lot to me, and I'm sure it will be worth just as much to you. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
