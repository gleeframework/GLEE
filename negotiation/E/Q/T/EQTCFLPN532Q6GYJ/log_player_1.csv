Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000, ensuring a good profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There is still $200,000 of potential profit to be gained, making it likely that Bob will counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point for Bob:** The price is well below the product's value to him, making it a potentially good deal for him. 

Remember, this is just the initial offer.  Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response, and always have the option to accept John's offer if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is higher than your minimum of $800,000, but it's still lower than your initial offer of $1,000,000.  This indicates that he's willing to negotiate and there's likely room for a higher price. By rejecting his offer, you can counter with a price closer to your initial offer, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to your target:** This counteroffer is closer to your initial offer of $1,000,000, increasing your potential profit.
* **Offering a compromise:** Meeting in the middle at $950,000 shows a willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Highlighting the value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth to him helps strengthen your negotiating position."
