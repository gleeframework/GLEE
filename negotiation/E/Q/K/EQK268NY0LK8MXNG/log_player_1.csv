Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

Bob is not moving towards a price point that justifies further negotiation. It's better to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 than risk Bob going even lower or the negotiation dragging on."
