Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

This offer is strategic for the following reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $11,500 is above your minimum of $10,000, so you'll still make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  $11,500 is less than the $12,000 Bob values the product at. This gives him an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob balks at the price, you have room to negotiate a bit lower without risking your minimum. 

By offering this price, you maximize your chances of getting a better price than John's offer while still leaving room for negotiation if needed."
