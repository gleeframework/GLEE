"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $12,000. This is a fair price that allows for some profit for you while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll sell the product to you for $15,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value the product holds for you, and it's still a good profit for me. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $13,000, which is a compromise from our previous offers. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows you to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can find a middle ground here.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $14,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price given the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
