"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not worth paying $18,000 for a product worth $10,000 to you.  You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll sell the product to you for $15,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value the product holds for you, and it's still a good profit for me. What do you think?

While $15,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above what you're willing to pay.  You should try to negotiate further.  There's still room to bargain."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $14,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price given the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. What do you think?

Alice is now offering $14,500, which is getting closer to your budget, but still more than you're willing to pay.  It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John at $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
