I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get more with some negotiation. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm aware I'm running out of rounds, but I'm still holding out for a better price. $1,075,000 is simply not enough for me to let go of the product at this point. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with Bob, and I'm not willing to sell to John just yet."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. 

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob. I've rejected his last offer, and there's a chance that he might not make another counteroffer.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is close to my minimum price and ensures I won't lose out on a sale altogether.  It's better to secure the sale now than to risk getting nothing."
