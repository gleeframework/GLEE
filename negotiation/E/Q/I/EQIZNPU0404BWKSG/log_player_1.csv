Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  He'll still get a good deal, saving $5 compared to John's price.
* **It's below John's value:** You'll still get a good price, earning $5 more than selling to John. 

This maximizes your chance of Bob accepting the offer while still getting a decent profit."
