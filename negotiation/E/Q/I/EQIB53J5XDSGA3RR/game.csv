"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a fair offer considering the value I see in the product.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,250, but I still need a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $8,000?  That's my absolute minimum, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.  Let's try to close this deal!",8000.0,Alice,5,
