"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  How about we bring the price down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle at $825,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  Could you consider $760,000? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about buying the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $795,000? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting very close to what I can do.  I'm willing to meet you at $780,000, but that's really the best I can offer.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really trying to make this work, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $780,000. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $790,000? It's a slight increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",790000.0,Alice,7,
