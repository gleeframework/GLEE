"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $15,000 right now. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $17,500 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $16,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both walk away happy.",16250.0,Bob,4,
