Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values it at $1,200,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for Alice (well above her $800,000 minimum). 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""potential value"" to justify the high price and encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at $800,000, ensuring she doesn't lose money."
