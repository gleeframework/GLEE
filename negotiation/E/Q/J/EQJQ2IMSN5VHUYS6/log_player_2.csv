"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs and exceed your expectations. Given its exceptional quality and functionality, it's valued at $10,000 by us. Considering its worth to you is $8,000, I propose we find a mutually beneficial arrangement. Would you be interested in discussing a price that could make this transaction appealing to both of us? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility for her to counter with a lower price, closer to your budget. 

By rejecting this offer, you're signaling to Alice that her price is too high and encouraging her to make a better offer."
