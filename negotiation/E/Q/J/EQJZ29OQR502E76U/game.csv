"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let me know if you're willing to consider my revised offer.",10500.0,Bob,4,
