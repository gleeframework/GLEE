"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can reach a more equitable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000. I have 8 more rounds to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $10,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer with $10,000 for your product. This price is within my budget and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can push for a higher price. I want to see if Bob is willing to go even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I need to recoup a bit more of my investment. Would you be willing to go to $11,000? This is a fair compromise, and it brings us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to consider your proposal. I would like to counter with $10,500 for your product. This is my final offer, as it aligns closely with my budget while still respecting the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation, and Bob's final offer is still below my minimum price point of $15,000. I've already had several rounds of negotiation and I'm not confident that I can convince Bob to go higher.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John and avoid the risk of Bob continuing to refuse my offers."
