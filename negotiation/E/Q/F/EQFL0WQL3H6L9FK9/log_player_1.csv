"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob, emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage his acceptance. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm not immediately going for my ideal $15,000 as I want to see if I can get closer to that through negotiation. 
* **Openness:** The ""What do you think?"" at the end encourages Bob to respond and potentially start a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below the $15,000 I could get from John. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my ideal price.
* **No rush to settle:**  I have 8 rounds left and there's no immediate pressure to accept.  

I'll counter with a price closer to $12,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000, but that's really my lowest price.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Compromise:** I'm lowering my price by $1,000, showing flexibility while still staying relatively firm.
* **Reiterating Value:** I remind Bob that the product is a ""great deal"" for him, reinforcing his interest in the product.
* **Urgency (Subtle):** The phrase ""Let's make this happen!"" adds a slight sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider my offer seriously. 
* **Maintaining Control:**  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired $15,000, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate."
