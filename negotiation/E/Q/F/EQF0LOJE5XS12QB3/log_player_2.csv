# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. I think it's a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
