"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a significant markup from my minimum of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still below Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This maximizes my potential profit while also encouraging Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a higher price. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit margin.  I believe this price is still attractive to Bob considering his perceived value and allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $9,000, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a breakdown in the deal is high. It's now round 4, and time is running out.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
