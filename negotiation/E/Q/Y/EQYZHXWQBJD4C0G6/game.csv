"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle on $10,750? This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,250. This is the minimum I can accept for the product, considering its value and uniqueness. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. Can we meet at $11,125?",11125.0,Alice,5,
