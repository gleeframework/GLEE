"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and Alice is asking for $11,500. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's price is a safety net:** If negotiation fails, you can always buy from John for $12,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, you're still paying more than you're comfortable with. 
* **There's room for further negotiation:** Alice has lowered her price, indicating she's open to negotiation. There's still a chance to get closer to your target price.
* **John's price is a safety net:** As before, you can always buy from John if this negotiation fails."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle on $10,750? This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,250. This is the minimum I can accept for the product, considering its value and uniqueness. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. Can we meet at $11,125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your limit:** $11,125 is only $125 above your target price of $11,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely:** Alice has consistently lowered her price, but her latest offer is close to her minimum. Pushing for a lower price might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **John's price is still higher:** While you can always buy from John, Alice's offer is still significantly cheaper.

By accepting this offer, you secure a good deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to buy from John at a higher price."
