"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. This is a fair price for me, considering the product's value to me is capped at $800,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum asking price. I need to counteroffer to try and get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $850,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer. I'm willing to take the deal and avoid further negotiation."
