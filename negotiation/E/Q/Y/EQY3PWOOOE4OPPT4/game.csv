"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has potential, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $500,000? That feels like a fair starting point.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the true value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $700,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value, Alice. While $700,000 is closer, it's still a significant investment for me.  Would you consider $600,000? That demonstrates my serious interest while recognizing we both need to compromise.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to the true value. How about we meet at $650,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To show I'm serious, I can go up to $620,000.  That's a substantial offer, and I'm hoping you'll see it as a sign of good faith to finalize the deal.",620000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! I'm starting to think we're really close. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. How about we meet at $630,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",630000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are very close!  I'm willing to split the difference with you one last time. How about $625,000 and we shake on it? This negotiation has gone on long enough, and I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",625000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're really close, but I still need to get a bit closer to the true value of the product. How about we meet at $632,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",632500.0,Alice,9,
