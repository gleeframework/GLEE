"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000.
* This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value. 
* It's important to remember that I have a safety net with John, allowing me to exit the negotiation if Bob's counteroffers become too low."

* While $9,000 is a tempting offer, it's still below my minimum desired value of $8,000.  
* With 4 rounds remaining, I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price.

* By offering $9,500, I'm meeting him halfway while still maintaining a position above my bottom line.
* With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to strike a balance between securing a deal and maximizing profit.
