Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that benefits us both."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.  
* **Above My Minimum:** It's crucial that the offer is significantly above my $10,000 minimum to ensure a good profit even if Bob negotiates.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John at $10,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate, so I can aim high with Bob."
