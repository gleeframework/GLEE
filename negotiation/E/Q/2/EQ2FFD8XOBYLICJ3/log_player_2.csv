"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you are still able to get the product for less than $12,000 (your maximum budget) by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with John.  

Here's why this is the best strategy:

* **Potential for Lower Price:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal to John that you are serious about purchasing the product but are willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This gives you leverage to potentially negotiate a lower price with John.
* **No Risk:** You are guaranteed to get the product at a price within your budget from John, so there is no risk involved in rejecting Alice's offer. 

It's important to remember that your goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, rejecting it opens the door to potentially getting the product for an even better price."
