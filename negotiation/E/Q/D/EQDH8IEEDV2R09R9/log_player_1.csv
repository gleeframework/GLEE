Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100:** This is a starting price that's higher than your minimum value ($80), allowing for room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** This is friendly and inviting, aiming to build rapport with Bob and make him feel comfortable negotiating. 

This approach allows for a back-and-forth conversation, giving you the flexibility to adjust your price based on Bob's response. It also sets a clear starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum value, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob.  I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a little low for me right now.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $92.50?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $92.50, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and focused on the value of the product, hoping to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $90, how does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price range.  While I could try to push for a bit more, it's not worth risking the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
