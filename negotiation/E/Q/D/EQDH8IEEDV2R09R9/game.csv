"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob.  I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a little low for me right now.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $92.50?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",92.5,Alice,3,
