"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $100? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a little high at $100, though.  How about $95?  It's closer to what I can afford, and I'd really love to get this product from you.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 was still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $95. How about we try $97.50? It's a bit of a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",97.5,Alice,5,
