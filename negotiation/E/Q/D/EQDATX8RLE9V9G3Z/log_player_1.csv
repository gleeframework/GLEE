Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum price:**  You're still getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's space for him to counteroffer without you having to give away too much. 
* **It shows you're confident in your product:** By starting at a higher price, you demonstrate the product's worth. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
