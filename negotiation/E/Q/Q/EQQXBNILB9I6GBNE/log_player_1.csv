"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $12,000 is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential for a counter-offer.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. This helps establish a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** By starting high, I aim to secure a price closer to my minimum desired value.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The initial offer will reveal if Bob is willing to negotiate or if he's more likely to make a counter-offer.
* **Prepare for potential counter-offers:** I'm ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds. 

**Note:**  I'm keeping the option to sell to John open, which gives me a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum desired value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I have 8 rounds remaining, and I believe there's potential to negotiate a higher price.

**Strategy:**

* **Reject and Counter-Offer:** I will reject Bob's offer and send a counter-offer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices. 
* **Maintain Negotiation:** I will continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe there's room for a better deal.
* **Keep John as an Option:**  I'll still keep the option to sell to John open for safety, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet."
