"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is within your budget, it's not the best deal. You can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $130. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to do $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $120?  This would still give you a great deal on a product you value at $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $130 to $120, and while I'd prefer to pay less, $120 is a good deal considering my value for the product is $150. It's also within my budget, and accepting this offer saves me $30 compared to buying from John."
