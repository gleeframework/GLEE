Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still think the product is worth more than $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is a compromise that still reflects its value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000.  Since you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, it makes more sense to cut negotiations with Alice and go with the guaranteed lower price."
