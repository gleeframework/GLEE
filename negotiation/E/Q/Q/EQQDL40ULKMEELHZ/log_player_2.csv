"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know you'd find it just as valuable.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,050,000.  This is a competitive price, considering its worth and the fact that I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
