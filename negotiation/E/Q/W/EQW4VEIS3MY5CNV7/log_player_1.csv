"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than the value to Bob, but not too high that it immediately seems unreasonable. This gives room for negotiation and potentially a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming for more.  I will reject this offer and counter-propose to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit that's more in line with my goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  $1,150,000 is closer to my goal, but I'll continue negotiating with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000}

I'm getting closer to my goal but I still have room to negotiate. I'm confident that I can close the deal with Bob without having to sell to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price and I'm confident I can get it. It's getting risky though, as I'm nearing the halfway point of the negotiation. I'll try one more counter offer before reconsidering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to settle for the value I know the product is worth to Bob, as I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
