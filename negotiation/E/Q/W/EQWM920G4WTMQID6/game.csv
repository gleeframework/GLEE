"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle on this.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000. I'll offer $1,050,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
