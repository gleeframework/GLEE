Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This also gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on how close it is to my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and the likelihood of reaching a deal with him. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $950,000.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a profit closer to my initial asking price. I'll see if Bob is willing to meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point. While I'd prefer to get closer to $950,000,  $920,000 is still a decent profit and a better outcome than selling to John. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
