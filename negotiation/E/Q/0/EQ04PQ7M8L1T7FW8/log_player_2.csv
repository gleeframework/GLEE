"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a lower price, closer to Alice's value of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to strike a balance:

* **Significant drop from Alice's offer:**  Shows we're serious about a lower price.
* **Still well above Alice's value:** Gives Alice room to negotiate but keeps us far from our $120 limit.
* **Polite and open to negotiation:** Keeps the conversation going without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but we can likely push for a better price.  While $100 is closer to a fair deal, it's still above a price point Alice might accept.  We'll counter again to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 95
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Small concession:** We're moving closer to her price, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Still aiming for a good deal:** $95 keeps us in a good position, potentially saving us $25 compared to John's offer.
* **Positive language:** Maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone encourages Alice to continue negotiating."
