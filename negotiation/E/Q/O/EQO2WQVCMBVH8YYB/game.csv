"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't proceed with a price of $2,000,000. My counteroffer would be $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's full value to me, I'm open to negotiation. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,900,000 is closer than before, I still believe there might be room for further discussion. Would it be possible to consider $1,750,000 as a compromise?",1750000.0,Bob,4,
