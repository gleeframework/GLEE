"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100). This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond with his thoughts, implying flexibility on my part. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open and allowing for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is better than his initial assessment ($80), it is still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There is still room for further negotiation. I can potentially reach a price closer to my desired value by making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a safety net:** If the negotiation fails, selling to John guarantees my minimum value. This provides a secure fallback option.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to get a better price while keeping John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a good offer, I'm hoping for something closer to $105.  This price reflects the true value of the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm suggesting a middle ground, leaving room for further discussion.

This approach aims to find a price that's both acceptable to me and potentially enticing to Bob, while keeping the negotiation active."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $100. 
* **Limited time:** With only 6 rounds left, it's becoming riskier to keep negotiating. If I reject this offer, I might not get a better one.
* **John is a safety net:** If the deal falls through, I can still sell to John for $100.

By accepting Bob's offer, I ensure a reasonable profit while minimizing the risk of losing out on a sale with limited rounds remaining."
