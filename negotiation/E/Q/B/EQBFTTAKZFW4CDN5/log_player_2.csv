"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, and you have the potential to get a better deal by negotiating.  There's no reason to buy from John at this point, as you're likely to get a better price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is a bit too low for me.

I believe this offer is reasonable and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
