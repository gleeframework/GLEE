"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is a bit high. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to lower the price significantly. It's important to start with a lower offer to leave room for further negotiation but keep it reasonable enough that Alice might consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $105, which is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a great deal for a product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm completely happy with. There's room for a counteroffer to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97?"",
""product_price"": 97
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $99, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This seems like a good point to accept.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $99 is a good price, saving $21 from the initial offer and $21 from John's price."
