Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) and my minimum ($100). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as a good deal to encourage Bob to consider it.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Start high:**  This sets a strong initial position and allows for potential negotiation.
2. **Leave room:**  There's space for me to lower the price if needed.
3. **Highlight value:**  The message focuses on the product's worth to incentivize Bob.

Remember, this is just the first offer. I'll be ready to adjust based on Bob's response and the potential of selling to John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for $90 just yet.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a price closer to my desired range.  It's important to remember that John is still an option if the negotiation falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm confident you'll find this product a worthwhile investment at that price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  My counteroffer is $100, which is my minimum acceptable price and also the midpoint between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90). 
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer while reiterating my own value proposition. I'm framing $100 as a compromise and emphasizing the product's worth.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating that I'm open to negotiation.
2. **Maintain my minimum:**  I'm not willing to go below $100.
3. **Keep the pressure on:**  I'm not conceding too quickly and leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'd prefer to get $100, accepting this offer is still a good outcome given that:

* **It's close to my minimum:** This allows me to avoid losing the product for a significantly lower price.
* **It's a quicker sale:** Accepting the offer allows me to finalize the sale and avoid further rounds of negotiation.
* **John is still an option:** If future deals with Bob don't work out, I can always sell to John for $100.

Considering these factors, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
