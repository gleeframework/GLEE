"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget, but it's still a good starting point for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,350,000, which is a $50,000 reduction from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially increasing the price or losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
