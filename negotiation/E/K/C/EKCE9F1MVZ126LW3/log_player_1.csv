Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. Based on my research and understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's worth to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to remember your bottom line. You know you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which matches Bob's current offer. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will yield a significantly better price.  It's strategically sound to take the guaranteed offer and move on."
