"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer. This is a common negotiation tactic.
* You know you can get the product for $15,000 from John. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $12,000. 

**It's worth the risk of losing the deal with Alice to potentially save $1,000 or more.**"
