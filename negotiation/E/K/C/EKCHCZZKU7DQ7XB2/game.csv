"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to try to find a middle ground. How about $115?",115.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in talks, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about $125? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $120?",120.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! However, I've already mentioned that I need to make a profit, and $120 is the minimum I can accept from you. I'm willing to stick to my guns on this one. How about we call it a day at $125?",125.0,Alice,7,
