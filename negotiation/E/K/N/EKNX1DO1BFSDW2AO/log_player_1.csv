I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Higher Profit Potential:** A higher price means a larger potential profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob may be willing to pay more than $1,200,000, but might not be willing to pay the full $1,500,000.  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, so I'm not risking a significant loss. 

I'll be ready to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer."
