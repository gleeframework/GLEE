"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to work with you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $85? This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not comfortable selling for $85.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial solution. While $92.50 is closer to my budget, I'm still looking for a price closer to $80. Could we perhaps meet at $87.50? This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to stay within my financial constraints while also providing you with a reasonable profit.",87.5,Bob,6,
