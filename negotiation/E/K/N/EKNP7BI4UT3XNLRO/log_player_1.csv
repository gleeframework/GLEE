{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price.  This allows room for negotiation and gives me a chance to assess his interest.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly. I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't come closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  While I understand he's trying to stay within his budget, I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss. I'll counter with a price closer to my target, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to work with you."", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between my minimum and Bob's offer.  It still allows for further negotiation while demonstrating my willingness to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $85? This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum price, $85 is still below my desired profit margin.  I'm not willing to sell at that price, but I'll counter with another offer in the hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not comfortable selling for $85.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
``` 
I'm proposing a price that's still slightly above Bob's last offer but closer to my minimum. It shows I'm flexible and willing to find a compromise.  I'm hoping this offer will be enough to entice him to finalize the deal without forcing me to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial solution. While $92.50 is closer to my budget, I'm still looking for a price closer to $80. Could we perhaps meet at $87.50? This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to stay within my financial constraints while also providing you with a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $87.50 is still too low.  While he's been persistent and willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for a price that significantly undercuts my minimum.  John is offering me my minimum price, and I'm confident I can sell to him quickly.  Therefore, I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
