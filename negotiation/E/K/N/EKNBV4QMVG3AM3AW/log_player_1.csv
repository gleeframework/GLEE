Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't lead to a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is still above my minimum value and leaves room for potential negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  While I'd prefer to get more than $150, I'm not willing to risk further negotiations and potentially end up with a price lower than what John is offering.  I'll sell to John and guarantee myself a profit."
