"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth at least that much to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000? That's still a good deal for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $13,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,250.  That's a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's still below what John is offering.  Let's close this deal.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $14,250. How about $13,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,6,
