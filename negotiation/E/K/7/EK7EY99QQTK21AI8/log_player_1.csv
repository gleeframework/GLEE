I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While I'm willing to sell to John for $120, I'd like to try and get a little more from Bob.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $135.  This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I hope this shows him I'm willing to compromise but also value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my desired price.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale."
