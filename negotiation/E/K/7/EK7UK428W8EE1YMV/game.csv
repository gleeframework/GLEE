"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me. While $1,000,000 is tempting, the true value of this product is much higher. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  This reflects its worth while recognizing your initial offer.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Given the value I place on the product and our ongoing discussions, I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we settle this right now at $1,140,000? This is my final offer, reflecting a fair deal for both of us.",1140000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,140,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I can't go above $1,050,000.  I'm confident this price is fair given the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's not let this deal fall throughâ€”I'm prepared to make a final decision.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
