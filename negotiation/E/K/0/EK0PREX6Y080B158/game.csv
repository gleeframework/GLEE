"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to make you a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a new offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
