"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I understand its worth to you is $800,000, but I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it represents a great opportunity for you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer who's ready to pay full price, but I wanted to give you first dibs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
