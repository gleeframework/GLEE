"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is $300,000 more than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Since you can buy the same product from John for $1,200,000, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best choice to save money."
