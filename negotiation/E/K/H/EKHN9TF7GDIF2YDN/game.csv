"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120, as I mentioned earlier. Can you meet me in the middle at $137.50?",137.5,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $137.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $150 for it. How about $155? It's a fair price considering its value.",155.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $155 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $140, as I mentioned earlier. Can you consider that?",140.0,Bob,4,,
