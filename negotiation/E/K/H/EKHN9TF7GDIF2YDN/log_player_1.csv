Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120, as I mentioned earlier. Can you meet me in the middle at $137.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $137.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $150 for it. How about $155? It's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 155}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140.

I'm selling the product to John for $150.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already had 4 rounds of negotiation.  John is a guaranteed sale for $150, which is more than Bob is offering."
