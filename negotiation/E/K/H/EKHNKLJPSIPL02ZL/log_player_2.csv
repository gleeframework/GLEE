# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your $1,000,000 budget and significantly cheaper than John's offer. Accepting her offer saves you money."
