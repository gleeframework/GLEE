"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1700000? This price allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a significant value proposition. Let's work together to find common ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1300000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we are still quite far apart. While I'm willing to be flexible, I cannot go as low as $1300000.  I'm prepared to offer a final compromise at $1550000. This represents a significant discount for you and gives me a fair return on my investment. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I urge you to consider this offer carefully.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider a price of $1450000?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
