"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go while still making a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $7,500. This is a fair offer considering we're getting close to my walk-away point.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to your walk-away point, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'll offer it to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. Let me know your decision.",8100.0,Alice,7,
