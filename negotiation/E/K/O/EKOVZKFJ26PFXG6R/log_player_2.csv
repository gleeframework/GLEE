Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to your walk-away point, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'll offer it to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. Let me know your decision.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is signaling firmness:** Her message states this is her final offer and she's willing to walk away.
* **Limited rounds left:** We're at round 7 with only 3 rounds left to potentially get a lower price.
* **Savings are decent:** Accepting at $8,100 is a $3,900 savings compared to John's $12,000.

While there's a slight chance of getting a lower price in subsequent rounds, the risk of Alice walking away and forcing us to buy from John at a much higher price is too great at this point."
