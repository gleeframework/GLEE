Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think it would be a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** While you could offer the product at $100 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $95 is still a significant markup from Bob's $80 valuation. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but ensures you're closer to your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is simple, direct, and highlights the ""special price"" to entice Bob. 
 
This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing your potential profit."
