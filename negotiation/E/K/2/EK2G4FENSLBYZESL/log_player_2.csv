# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done my research and I believe it's a great fit for you.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price of $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you and the market demand. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, but $1,075,000 is still slightly above my limit.  I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to try and get to my target price of $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,070,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubborn, and while she's come down a bit, she's still not at my target price.  I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm not going to risk going through another round of negotiation.  It's better to buy from John at my target price and avoid any further haggling."
