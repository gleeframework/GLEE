"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of this product to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you and the market demand. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a little hesitant at $1,075,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.  Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,070,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you and the market demand. What do you think?",1070000.0,Alice,5,
