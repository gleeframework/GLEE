Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering it at $150 or more to Bob is unlikely to get a sale.  A price of $125 is:
    * A significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($100).
    * A potential gain of $25 compared to selling to John. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
