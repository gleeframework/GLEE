Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly remind Bob that the product is worth a significant amount.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but rather inviting for a discussion, signaling you might be open to adjusting the price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, you don't want to reveal that to Bob. This could weaken your negotiating position.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to consider the offer seriously."
