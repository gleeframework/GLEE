{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum but leaves room for potential bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $10,500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to go down a bit to $11,000.  This reflects the value of the product to both of us, and gives us a chance to make a deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. How about $10,750?  That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum value of $10,000.  While I'd prefer more, it's a good compromise and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
