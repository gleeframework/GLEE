"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is a step in the right direction,  I'm still not able to accept $950,000. Given the product's value and my own costs, I need to stay closer to $1,100,000.  This price still offers you a significant return on investment. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement. While your offer is closer to what I need, I'm still hoping we can find a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to come out ahead.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
