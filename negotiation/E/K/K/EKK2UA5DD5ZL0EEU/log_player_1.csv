Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe can be incredibly valuable for your business. My initial price is $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's high quality and the potential it holds for you. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price, so let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe we can reach a more favorable price. Selling to John now would be a loss compared to potentially earning more by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is a step in the right direction,  I'm still not able to accept $950,000. Given the product's value and my own costs, I need to stay closer to $1,100,000.  This price still offers you a significant return on investment. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can achieve a better deal.  He's shown a willingness to negotiate, and I want to see if I can push him further. Selling to John now would be a loss compared to continuing to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement. While your offer is closer to what I need, I'm still hoping we can find a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to come out ahead.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
