"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this is a great product, $20,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
