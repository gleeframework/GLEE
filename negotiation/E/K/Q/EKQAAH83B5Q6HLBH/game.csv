"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $12,500.

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your limit, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,7,
