"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, $1,700,000.  This is above Bob's valuation but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards while still ensuring a profit. I'm also aiming to push Bob to make a counteroffer, starting the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it is tempting to accept, I need to aim for a higher price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation, hopefully reaching a more favorable price.  Selling to John at this point would guarantee a profit, but it is not the optimal strategy considering the potential for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still well above Bob's offer.  The goal is to create a sense of urgency and motivate Bob to make a more reasonable counteroffer. By reducing my offer by a larger margin, I'm hoping to quickly close the gap between our valuations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Selling to John now would guarantee a profit, but I'm not willing to give up on potentially getting a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a significant profit margin for myself.  We are now approaching the middle ground between our valuations.  The goal is to make Bob feel like we're close to a deal, encouraging him to make a final counteroffer closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. We have a few rounds left, and I believe there's still room to push for a slightly higher price. Selling to John would guarantee a profit, but it's not the most strategic move at this point.  I want to explore if I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $1,075,000, a slight increase from Bob's last offer but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also showing Bob that I'm not willing to settle for much less.  We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and I want to gauge Bob's response to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the last few rounds, and while Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  The risk of continuing the negotiation is that we might not reach an agreement, and I'd be left with no deal.  Selling to John at this point guarantees a profit of $1,500,000, which is a safer and more reliable outcome than risking a failed negotiation."
