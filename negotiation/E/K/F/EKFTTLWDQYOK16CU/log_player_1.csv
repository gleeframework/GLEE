Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **Is lower than your minimum:**  $14,000 is less than your minimum, giving you some room to negotiate down.
* **Is a clear and concise message:**  The message is friendly and includes the price, making it easy for Bob to understand.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate further. If he rejects, you can adjust your price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but Bob's counteroffer is too low. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can find a middle ground before moving on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13,000?  It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,800 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum of $15,000.  Negotiating further risks losing Bob entirely and having to settle for John's offer, which is also below my ideal.  By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale that's reasonably close to my minimum and avoid any further back-and-forth."
