**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is $100,000 above Bob's maximum price. While Alice is confident in the value of the product, it's more advantageous for Bob to reject her offer and buy the product from John for $1,500,000, saving him the extra $100,000."
