"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $145 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best possible price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $145 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $135?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm glad you're interested! I can come down a bit to $140, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $140 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit higher than he'd like. Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $137.50. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 137.5}
