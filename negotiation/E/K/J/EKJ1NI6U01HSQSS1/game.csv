"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only offering it to you today. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11500, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $11000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
