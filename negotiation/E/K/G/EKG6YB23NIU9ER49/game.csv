"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you think $12,000 is a bit too high, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. How about we discuss a price around there?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. However, I'm working with a tight budget. Could we settle on $10,000? That would be a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob, but $10,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. How about we meet at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I can see you're firm on the price, so I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit. How about $10,500? That's my final offer.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob, but I still need to get a better price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, which is $10,750. This is my final offer.",10750.0,Alice,7,
