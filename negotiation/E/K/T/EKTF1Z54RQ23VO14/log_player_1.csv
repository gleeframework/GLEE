Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $6,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to at least get $8,500 for it to make it worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,250 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $7,750.  This is a good price for both of us and allows us to move forward.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you trying to work with my budget.  How about this: $7,500, and we have a deal? That's a really fair price, and it lets us both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $7,500 is a good deal considering Bob's budget and the fact that we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.  It's better to close the deal now rather than risk losing the sale altogether."
