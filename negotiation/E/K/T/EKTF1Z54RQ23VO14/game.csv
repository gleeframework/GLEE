"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to at least get $8,500 for it to make it worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $7,750.  This is a good price for both of us and allows us to move forward.  What do you think?",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you trying to work with my budget.  How about this: $7,500, and we have a deal? That's a really fair price, and it lets us both walk away happy.",7500.0,Bob,6,
