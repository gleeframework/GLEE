"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit outside my budget.  How about $95?  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being willing to compromise, Alice.  $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet at $108? It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done.",108.0,Alice,5,
