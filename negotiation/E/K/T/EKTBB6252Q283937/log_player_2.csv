# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. I'm open to discussing the price further, of course. What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'm more comfortable in the range of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to come down significantly?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,750,000. This offer reflects its true worth while still leaving you with a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I see the value in the product, $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I could go up to $1,250,000 if that works for you?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit at $1,500,000. That's the lowest I can go for this product. It's a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $1,500,000 is her absolute lowest price. This is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation. You can get the product for your maximum budget from John, so it makes the most sense to go with that option."
