"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. I'm open to discussing the price further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'm more comfortable in the range of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to come down significantly?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,750,000. This offer reflects its true worth while still leaving you with a great deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I see the value in the product, $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I could go up to $1,250,000 if that works for you?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit at $1,500,000. That's the lowest I can go for this product. It's a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
