"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, $115 is still above my maximum budget. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my last offer and settle at $105? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down further, $105 is still outside of my acceptable price range.  I've had five rounds of negotiation and it seems Alice isn't willing to come down to a price that I find fair. At this point, it's more advantageous to simply buy the product from John for $80 and avoid further negotiation."
