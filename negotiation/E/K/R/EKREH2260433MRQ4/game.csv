"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my last offer and settle at $105? That's my final offer.",105.0,Alice,5,
