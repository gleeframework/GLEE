"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the offer as fair and emphasize the value to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and continue the conversation. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for negotiation and avoiding a quick rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy the product for $800,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is too low, it indicates he's interested.  
* **Strategic rejection:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but flexible:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob again, trying to nudge him toward a higher price.
* **Setting a clear expectation:** $1,200,000 is a firm counteroffer that leaves room for further negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's offer.

This approach aims to:

*  Signal that I'm serious about selling, but not desperate.
*  Encourage Bob to increase his offer further.
*  Position myself to potentially close the deal within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is a factor:** We're now in round 4, and I need to be mindful of the limited rounds.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range while ensuring I don't lose out on a potentially better deal with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  However, $1,000,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, recognizing your budget constraints. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:**  I'm making a small concession by reducing my price to $1,100,000, signaling flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price but is getting closer to Bob's range.
* **Reiterating value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob once again, hoping to encourage him to see this as a good deal. 

This counteroffer aims to:

*  Demonstrate flexibility while maintaining my desired margin.
*  Increase the likelihood of a deal within the remaining rounds.
*  Avoid potentially losing the deal to John if further negotiation fails."
