"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and even her own valuation of the product. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy the product for $800,000. Let me know what you think."",
 ""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** This offer leaves ample room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.  
* **Alternative Option:**  You always have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice's counter-offer is a significant improvement, it's still above your $1,000,000 budget.
* **More Negotiation Possible:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests she's motivated to sell. There's a good chance of getting the price closer to your target.
* **Backup Option:** You can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Alice falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching Your Limit:**  This counter-offer represents your maximum budget. 
* **Fair Compromise:**  It positions the offer as a fair compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer and her counter-offer.
* **Pressure Point:** This offer lets Alice know you're serious but also have a firm limit. It encourages her to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  However, $1,000,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, recognizing your budget constraints. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go below $1,100,000, which is still above your maximum budget.
* **Time is a Factor:** You've already used 5 out of 10 rounds.  Continuing the negotiation risks missing out on buying from John.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, saving you $100,000 compared to Alice's current offer. 

It's better to secure a good deal with John than risk ending up with no deal or a price higher than your budget."
