"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $600,000 is simply too low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum expectation. I'm prepared to compromise further, but I need to see a more substantial offer.  I'm willing to accept $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your potential profit. Let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above your alternative option. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, and there's no guarantee Alice will go that low. It's better to secure the product at a price you know works for you."
