"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $600,000 is simply too low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. I can go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum expectation. I'm prepared to compromise further, but I need to see a more substantial offer.  I'm willing to accept $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your potential profit. Let's finalize the deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
