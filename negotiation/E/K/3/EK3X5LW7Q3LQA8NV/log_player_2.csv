"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a price that works for both of us. My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her, but still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth negotiating to see if a lower price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,300,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,300,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This gives you a substantial saving and allows me to keep the product close to my target. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's desired price point.  There's still room for negotiation, so it's worth rejecting and seeing if Alice will come down further.  It's also worth considering that Bob could be leaving money on the table by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,325,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to achieve a reasonable sale price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's close this deal at $1,340,000. This offer represents a significant value for you and allows me to reach a price point that I'm comfortable with. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,340,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,340,000 is the closest to Bob's target price yet.  It's still within Bob's budget, and only slightly above his ideal price. Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate and Bob may end up having to pay more to John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob at this point."
