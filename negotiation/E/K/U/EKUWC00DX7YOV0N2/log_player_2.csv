"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $95 is still a bit too high for Bob.  We'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I can see you're serious about this. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $95, it's still above his ideal price point. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
