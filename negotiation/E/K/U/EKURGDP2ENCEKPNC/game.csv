"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value our potential partnership, I can't accept $1,000,000.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,350,000. This still allows me to make a profit while giving you a fair price. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to get a good price while giving me a product within my budget.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $1,100,000 doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down further, but only to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair offer. If you're serious about acquiring the product, let's work towards this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  I'm still stuck at $1,100,000.  This is the very top of my budget, and I'm confident we can reach a fair deal at this price.  I'm sure you can find other ways to make up the difference elsewhere. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
