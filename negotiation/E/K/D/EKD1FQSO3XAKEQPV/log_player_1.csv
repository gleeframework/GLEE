Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes it more likely to secure a price closer to your ideal outcome.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly justifies the high price without revealing her minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Subtly reminding Bob of other potential buyers (by mentioning a public listing) creates a sense of urgency and competition. 

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net at $10,000, this strategy aims to maximize profit by seeing if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
