"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $10,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth more than what you perceive its value to be, at a price that still yields a substantial profit for me. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is too high.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's more than what I would pay from another seller, and still leaves you with a profit.  Let's make a deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to maintain my minimum profit margin. I am willing to accept $9,000 for the product. This price allows me to achieve a reasonable profit while still being competitive in the market. I hope we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
