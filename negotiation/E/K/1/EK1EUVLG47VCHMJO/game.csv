"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $1500000. Let me know if you're interested!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, my budget for this product is limited to $800000. Would you consider adjusting your price to meet my budget?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're interested!",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, my budget remains fixed at $800000. I would like to propose an alternative solution. Instead of a single lump sum, could we discuss a payment plan that allows me to acquire the product within my financial constraints?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern about the payment plan, Bob. However, I'm not willing to compromise on the overall price. Instead, I'm willing to consider a 5% discount if you're willing to pay the full amount upfront. This would bring the price down to $1200000. If you're still interested, let me know and we can discuss the details of the payment plan.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. Unfortunately, the $1200000 price point exceeds my budget. I am unable to adjust my budget further. However, I would like to inquire if there are any additional discounts available if I were to purchase other items from your inventory. I believe this might open up more negotiation possibilities for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
