"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $2000000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is still a substantial investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $1000000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1750000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that offers value for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
