"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about we aim for a price between $100 and $120? What would you consider a reasonable offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still above your maximum budget of $80.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering our previous discussion, how about we aim for a middle ground? Would $105 be a price you'd find acceptable for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get it even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $105 is still a bit steep for me. Let's try to split the difference - I'm happy to pay $95 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a price that both of us can agree upon. Considering our previous offers, how about we settle for $100 for the product? I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $100, which is still $20 more than I'm willing to pay. I've already made multiple counteroffers, and it seems Alice is not willing to budge further.  At this point, it's more beneficial for me to buy from John for $80. I've already saved $20, and I can avoid further negotiation."
