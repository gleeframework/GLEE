"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about we aim for a price between $100 and $120? What would you consider a reasonable offer?",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering our previous discussion, how about we aim for a middle ground? Would $105 be a price you'd find acceptable for the product?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $105 is still a bit steep for me. Let's try to split the difference - I'm happy to pay $95 for the product. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a price that both of us can agree upon. Considering our previous offers, how about we settle for $100 for the product? I believe this is a fair compromise.",100.0,Alice,5,
