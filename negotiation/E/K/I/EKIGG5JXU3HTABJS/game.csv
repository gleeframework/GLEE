"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I've done my research and understand its value to you is $1500000. Considering that, I'm willing to make a generous offer of $1200000. This is a significant discount from its true value, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.
