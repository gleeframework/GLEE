"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential for you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob's budget. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, as Bob has 10 rounds to try and reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* Buying from John for $800,000 is always an option, but it's beneficial to try and get a better deal if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, but still above his ideal price.
* There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has 7 rounds left to try and get a lower price.
* Buying from John for $800,000 is still an option, but it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still not quite there. How about $900,000? That's a significant step closer to my budget, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a final compromise from my end, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $925,000 is within Bob's budget, and it's getting close to his ideal price. 
* While there's still room for negotiation, it's likely Alice will not go lower than $925,000. 
* Accepting this offer would save Bob $25,000 compared to buying from John.
*  Since Bob only has 5 rounds left, it's better to accept a deal that's close to his target price."
