"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth more to you. Let me know what you think!

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,000?  That gives you a good deal, and I can still get a decent price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
