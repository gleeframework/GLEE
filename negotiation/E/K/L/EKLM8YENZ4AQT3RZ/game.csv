"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20000 for it. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $10000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $17000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $13500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we try $14500? This is my final offer.",14500.0,Bob,6,
