Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate. I also try to pique Bob's interest with a positive message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $90 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $90 is still a bit too low for me, given my minimum value of $80. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $92 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $92.  This is still higher than my minimum value of $80 and closer to my desired price than John's offer of $80. It seems like we've reached a compromise, and it's worth it to close the deal."
