Alice's offer is still too high. Bob should reject and counteroffer again.  Even though the offer was reduced, Bob is still better off buying from John."

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering.  Bob should buy from John to save $750,000."
