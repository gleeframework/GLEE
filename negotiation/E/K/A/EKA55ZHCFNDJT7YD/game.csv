"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,100,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we might have different valuations for this product. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
