"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $17,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than his minimum price, as he's already expressed interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, so I can't accept it.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $16,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price, as he's already shown his interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum price.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $15,500. This is still above my minimum price, but it shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal. I'm hoping he'll recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price.  I'm also concerned that we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I might not get a better offer from Bob.  To ensure I secure a good price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
