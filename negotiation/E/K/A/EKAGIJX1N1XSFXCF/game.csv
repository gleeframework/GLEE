"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping for a price closer to my maximum budget of $15000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $13000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $13000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15000. Let me know if that works for you!",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can still reach an agreement. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $14000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still acquiring the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $14250? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're close to an agreement, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $14000. I'm willing to meet you at $14200, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product.",14200.0,Alice,7,
