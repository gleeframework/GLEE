Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $130?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay under $80 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $110 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly more than Bob's initial offer and surpasses my minimum acceptable price. There's always a risk that further negotiation could lead to Bob backing out, so it's better to secure the deal now."
