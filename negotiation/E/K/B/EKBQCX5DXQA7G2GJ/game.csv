"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to be transparent. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can agree on this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
