"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product! While it looks great, $120 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $90?",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $70? That's a fair deal for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm still willing to compromise.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  My last offer is $75.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with a different seller.",75.0,Bob,6,
