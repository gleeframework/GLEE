"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to secure the product for a bit less. Would you consider $850,000? I believe this is still a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $860,000? This would be a significant savings for me, while still allowing you to make a healthy profit.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $860,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $880,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to secure the product for a bit less.  Would you consider $870,000? This is a fair price that would benefit both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",870000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $890,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can understand that the product's value is worth more than that. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",890000.0,Alice,7,
