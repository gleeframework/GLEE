"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset worth significantly more to you, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's start the negotiation with this offer. ",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I receive a fair value for my product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to accept $1,300,000. This allows you to still gain significant value from the product, and it ensures a profitable transaction for me. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  While I'm willing to work with you, $1,150,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  Let's bridge the gap. I'm offering $1,250,000. It's a fair price that still allows you significant savings compared to your initial valuation.  Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'll try to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product to me, while also being reasonable for you.",1175000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's fair considering your previous offers. Let's end this negotiation with a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'll try to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,175,000.
