"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,500. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, so this is a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore other options or negotiate further with Alice."
