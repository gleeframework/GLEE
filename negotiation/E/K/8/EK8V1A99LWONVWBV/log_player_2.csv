"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and more than I would get from another buyer. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While her offer is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting it. This will push her to potentially lower the price further or allow you to buy from John for $12,000."
