"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I know it's even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a bit more commitment from your side.  How about we settle on $1,300,000?  That's a significant compromise from my initial offer and gives you a good deal.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. I'm confident we can find a price that benefits both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This shows my commitment to making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $1,250,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,275,000. This shows my willingness to meet you halfway.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a deal worth closing. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
