"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraint, but I'm not comfortable selling the product for $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,000 is still a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $7,750. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
