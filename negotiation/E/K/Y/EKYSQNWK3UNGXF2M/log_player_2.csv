"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Alice and $100 to you.  Alice's offer of $95 is too high.  Rejecting her offer gives you the chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85?  I'm happy to pay that price, and it's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
