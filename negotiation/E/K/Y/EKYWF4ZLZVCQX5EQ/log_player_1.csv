Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm willing to make this offer particularly attractive to ensure a swift deal. Would a price of $1,350,000 interest you?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, attempting to sell to Bob first allows for potential profit above that.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,350,000 is significantly appealing to Bob (a $350,000 gain for him) while still securing a $1,350,000 profit for me.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The wording hints at other interested parties and frames the offer as time-sensitive, potentially encouraging Bob to accept."
