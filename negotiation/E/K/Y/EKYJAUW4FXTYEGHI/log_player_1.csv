{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point. It's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust the price slightly depending on his counteroffer and my desire to close the deal quickly or get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further to try to get closer to my goal of $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
