"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a reasonable offer to get us started. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1100000 is still above my budget. To be fair, I'm looking to spend no more than $800000. Would you be willing to work with me on that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is firm at $800000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the potential benefit for both of us. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $800000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
