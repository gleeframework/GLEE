"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a reasonable offer to get us started. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are looking to save as much money as possible, and $1,100,000 is still above your desired budget. You can use this as an opportunity to start negotiations and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. To be fair, I'm looking to spend no more than $800,000. Would you be willing to work with me on that price?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $950,000 is still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your desired price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is firm at $800,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the potential benefit for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $800000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. Alice has made it clear that she is unwilling to go lower than $900,000, which is still above your desired price. While you might be able to continue negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal. It's wiser to avoid the risk and secure the product from John at your target price."
