"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than this.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While your initial offer is a bit lower than I hoped, I recognize your strong interest. To find a compromise, I propose a price of $2,025,000. This reflects a significant step from my initial ask, and I believe it's a fair price that considers the exceptional value this product brings.",2025000.0,Alice,3,
