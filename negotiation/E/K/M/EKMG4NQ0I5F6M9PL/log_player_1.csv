Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above my minimum. 
* **Gauge Interest:** A higher initial offer helps me understand how interested Bob is and how much he values the product. 

This strategy prioritizes getting the highest possible price from Bob while still securing a sale."
