Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit, but be realistic:**  While you value the product at $150, you know Bob only values it at $100. Offering it at $150 is likely to scare him off.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting with $140 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested, potentially earning you even more. 
* **Strong alternative:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so there's no pressure to go below that price."
