"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, it's still above his desired budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a better price through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $11,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get the price closer to his desired range. This counteroffer is still above Alice's desired selling price, but leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired budget, it's still above his maximum of $12,000. Bob is trying to save as much as possible, so he should continue negotiating. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $10,750? It's a fair compromise that's closer to both of our positions."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is proposing a price that's halfway between his previous offer of $10,500 and Alice's offer of $11,000. This shows a commitment to finding a compromise and is a reasonable counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving."
