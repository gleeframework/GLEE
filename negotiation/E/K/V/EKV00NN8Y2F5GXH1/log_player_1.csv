"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price that is close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay a premium as the product is worth $10,000 to him.  This offer allows for potential counteroffers while still keeping a significant profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can secure a higher price, especially since the product is worth $10,000 to him.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm reducing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to continue negotiating while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. Although I'd prefer a higher price, I need to consider the number of rounds remaining and the potential risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit, even if it's not my ideal outcome."
