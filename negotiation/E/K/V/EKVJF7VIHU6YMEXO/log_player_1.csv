Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this price reflects its quality and potential."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  $18,000 is still a little too steep for me though.  Could we possibly settle on $12,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to the product's value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $16,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I can tell this product is important to you, and I respect that.  How about we make one final push - $13,000 and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
 
Explanation: Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $13,000.  While we could try to negotiate further, accepting his next offer might only net us an extra $1,000 at most. We have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John, making it the most logical choice at this point."
