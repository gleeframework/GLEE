"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this price reflects its quality and potential.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  $18,000 is still a little too steep for me though.  Could we possibly settle on $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to the product's value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $16,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I can tell this product is important to you, and I respect that.  How about we make one final push - $13,000 and we have a deal?",13000.0,Bob,6,
