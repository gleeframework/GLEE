Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is seriously interested and has a high perceived value for the product. If he rejects, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is a significant sum, I believe I can get closer to my desired value.  I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but still aiming for a value closer to my desired $800,000 minimum.  This shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but I'm not willing to drastically lower the price just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer has dropped too low.  While I would like to get a higher price, selling to John for $800,000 ensures I meet my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
