"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John.  Alice's starting price is already close to our budget, but there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're starting with a counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $100 budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a better price. Let's see if we can nudge her a bit closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $82 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $75."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're holding firm on our desired price range but acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate.  This keeps the conversation positive while pushing for a more favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'll offer it to you for $80, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has reached her lowest price, which matches her product's value. It's unlikely we'll get a better deal, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the opportunity.  Accepting this offer secures us the product at a good price."
