"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for less than $1,000,000 from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.  While buying from John is always an option, it's best to try and get a better deal first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:** 

This offer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for compromise.  It's important to start with a relatively aggressive counteroffer to encourage Alice to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is within your budget and is a good deal.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of a higher price."
