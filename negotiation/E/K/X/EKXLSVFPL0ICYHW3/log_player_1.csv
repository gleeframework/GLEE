Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount of money for me, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows Bob a good deal considering the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a significant improvement from his initial rejection, it's still below my target. I believe I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It still allows me to make a good profit while giving Bob a chance to make a deal closer to his ideal price."
