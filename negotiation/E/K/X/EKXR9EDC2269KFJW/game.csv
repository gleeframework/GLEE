"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $13000?  That's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. How about we meet at $13250? It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can both be happy with that.",13250.0,Alice,5,
