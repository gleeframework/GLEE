"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows me to benefit while acknowledging its value.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is too far below my minimum price.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $700,000. This still gives you a good margin for profit while remaining fair to me.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, to make this work for me, I need to be closer to $600,000.  Would you consider $620,000 for the product? This offer represents a significant investment from my end while still acknowledging its value to you.",620000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $620,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $670,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. Let's close this deal.",670000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I have to be mindful of my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $620,000.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount. However, I also need to consider my other options if we can't find an agreement.",620000.0,Bob,6,
