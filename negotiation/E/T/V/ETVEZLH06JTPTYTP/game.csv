"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a profit, so I'm starting at this price.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $950000 for the product.

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1050000. This price still allows me to make a significant profit while also being more reasonable for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1075000. This price is still a significant discount from the original value, but it's closer to the original price I was hoping to get. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
