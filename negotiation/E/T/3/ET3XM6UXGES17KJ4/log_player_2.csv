# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find this price reasonable.

I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  It's still within a range where I can potentially save money but also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into developing it.

```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price.  It's a small increase from my previous offer, showing good faith but not giving away too much.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with, and we're down to the final round. There's no guarantee that she'll accept my next counteroffer, and the risk of not getting the product is too high.  It's better to buy from John at $1,500,000 than risk getting nothing at all.  This ensures I get the product, even if it's at a slightly higher price."
