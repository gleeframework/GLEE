"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into developing it.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also ensuring a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,300,000. I've invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I believe it's worth more than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,225,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your investment in the product, but $1,225,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your effort while also staying within my budget.  Let's reach a deal before we run out of time.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
