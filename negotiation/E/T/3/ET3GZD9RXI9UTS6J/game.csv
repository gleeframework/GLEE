"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,300,000. However, I was thinking we could meet somewhere in the middle of our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,325,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
