Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Product Price:**  $11,000 is a price that is still profitable for me (as it is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000). 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. It also subtly mentions my minimum acceptable value.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price slightly below my minimum acceptable value, I am trying to maximize my profit while still considering the possibility of a successful sale. This strategy is based on the assumption that Bob may be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value if the price is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. If Bob rejects the offer, I am guaranteed a sale to John for $12,000."
