"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable. My starting price is $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,400,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return.  Let's meet at $1,300,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it still leaves you with a substantial profit margin.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I still think it's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 still falls short of the product's true worth. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer $1,275,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, which is closer to my original offer. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I respect your position.  I'm willing to come down to $1,240,000.  This is a compromise that allows both of us to move closer to a deal.  Let's bridge the gap and make this happen.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1240000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,240,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
