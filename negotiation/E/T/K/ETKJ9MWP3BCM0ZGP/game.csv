"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'd like to try to save some money. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $135. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $125. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to try to get the price a bit lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",125.0,Bob,4,
