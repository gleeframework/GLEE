"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think you'll find it's a great investment. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given my maximum spending limit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1400000. This is still a great deal considering its value to me, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from owning it. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. If this isn't acceptable, I'm going to have to move on to other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1200000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1500000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
