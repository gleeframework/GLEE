# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think you'll find it's a great investment. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1400000. This is still a great deal considering its value to me, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from owning it. What do you think?

Alice is still offering a price higher than my maximum budget. I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1200000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Alice's final offer is still higher than my maximum budget. It's time to stop negotiating and buy the product from John for $1,000,000. It's a better deal than Alice's offer, and I'm sure I can find a way to make it work."
