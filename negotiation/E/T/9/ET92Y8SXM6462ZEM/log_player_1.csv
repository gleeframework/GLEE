Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $1,250,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encouraging. I highlight the potential benefit for Bob and emphasize that this is a good deal for him. 

**Why this strategy?**

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still considering the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  

* **Higher chance of acceptance:**  By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value, I increase the chance that he'll accept the offer. 
* **Good profit:**  Even at $1,250,000, I'm still making a profit of $250,000.  
* **Safety net:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
