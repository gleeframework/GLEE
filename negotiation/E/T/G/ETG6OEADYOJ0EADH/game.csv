"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I can offer you a compromise at $155. It's the lowest I'm willing to go.",155.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $155 is still more than I'm willing to pay. Let's split the difference and I'll take it for $152.50. It's a fair price for both of us.",152.5,Bob,6,
