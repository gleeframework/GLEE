"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our needs.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $900,000.",825000.0,Alice,3,
