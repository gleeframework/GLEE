"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $13,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it would be a great price for me.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $13,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high. How about $13,250?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",13250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go below $13,750. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,5,
