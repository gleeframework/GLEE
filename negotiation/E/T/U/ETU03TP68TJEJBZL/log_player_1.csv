Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, we want to capture as much of that value as possible while ensuring he accepts the deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still keeps the price well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Create Urgency (Subtle):**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" hints that this offer might not last forever, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer instead of forcing you to sell to John for $10,000."
