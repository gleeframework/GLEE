```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice will go lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

```
