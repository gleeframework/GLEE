Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. It's incredibly valuable, and I know you'll benefit greatly from it. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible, which is my guaranteed sale price to John. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values it at $800,000, I need to price it below his perceived value, but significantly above to maximize my gain.
* **Negotiating Room:** The $950,000 offer leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
