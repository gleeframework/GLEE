"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I get to sell it to someone who truly appreciates its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.
