"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to go that low? ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,750. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $9,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $9,000? It's a good middle ground for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to reach a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $9,250. This is as low as I can go without losing too much profit.",9250.0,Alice,5,
