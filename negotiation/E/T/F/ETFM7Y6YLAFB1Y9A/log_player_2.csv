"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $7,500 is a good price, but it's worth seeing if Alice will go lower. There's a good chance she might be willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price.  This will test her willingness to negotiate. If she's serious about selling, she'll likely come back with a counteroffer closer to my price.  If she rejects it outright, I'll have to adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to $6,500, which is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my desired range. I'm not sure how much lower she'll go, and I risk losing a good deal by continuing to negotiate. At this point, accepting the offer seems like the best course of action."
