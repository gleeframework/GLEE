Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  My message emphasizes the ""fantastic deal"" for Bob, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired minimum of $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will analyze Bob's response and then decide:

* **Accept his counteroffer:** If his counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Make a counteroffer:** If his offer is too low, I'll counter with a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Sell to John:** If I'm not satisfied with Bob's negotiation and feel I won't get a good price, I'll sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about we set the product price at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, especially considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices. I'll aim for a price closer to my $1,000,000 goal, possibly offering a price of $950,000 to show I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. Let's split the difference - how about $925,000? This ensures a fair deal for both parties, and we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $925,000 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for his initial price.
* **Positive framing:** I reiterate the benefits of a deal, emphasizing fairness and a quick closure.
* **Staying close to my minimum:** $925,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some leeway if Bob counteroffers again.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  I'll carefully consider his response to my counteroffer. 
* **Accept or reject:** Depending on his counteroffer, I'll decide whether to accept or reject. 
* **Sell to John:** If Bob's final offer is too low, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a price closer to my initial budget. How about setting the product price at $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for a price that's a substantial loss for me. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, hoping to bridge the gap. I'll aim for a price closer to my desired outcome, perhaps offering a price of $900,000. I'll emphasize that this is my final offer, and if he doesn't accept, I will proceed to sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 simply won't work for me.  I'm willing to go one last time to $900,000. This reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll be forced to move on to another buyer.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or lose the deal.
* **Bridging the gap:**  I'm offering $900,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price and still represents a significant gain for Bob.
* **Emphasize consequences:**  I highlight the consequences of not accepting my offer, implying that I have a backup plan and am not desperate. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** I'll carefully consider his response and whether it's worth accepting.
* **Sell to John:** If Bob rejects my final offer, I'll move forward with selling the product to John for $1,000,000."
