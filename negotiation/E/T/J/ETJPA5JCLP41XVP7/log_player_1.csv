Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and makes it seem like a ""good deal"" to Bob.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  This price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, keeping the negotiation alive while still giving me a profitable outcome.
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob counteroffers, I can still make a reasonable counteroffer while keeping my minimum in mind. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing that I have John willing to pay my minimum price gives me confidence to negotiate with Bob without fear of losing out on a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and it's still within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** I'm confident that I can push Bob higher with a counteroffer.  He's shown interest and is willing to negotiate, indicating there's room for a more favorable outcome. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm not desperate. I can always fall back on John's offer if I don't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of this product. However, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards the middle:**  My counteroffer is a significant increase from Bob's offer but is still below my minimum. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  I've provided a reason for my price (the value of the product).  This helps Bob understand my perspective and encourages him to consider a higher offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I've ended the message with a call to action, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:** $1,050,000 is still significantly above my minimum, allowing me to potentially earn a higher amount.
* **Maintain a good relationship with Bob:**  By being reasonable and open to negotiation, I'm keeping the door open for a successful deal while maintaining a professional and respectful tone.
* **Prepare for further counteroffers:**  I've positioned myself to potentially make another counteroffer if Bob isn't satisfied with my current proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer is still too low:** $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation has reached a stalemate:** Bob's statement that this is his ""final offer"" suggests that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.
* **John's offer guarantees a profitable outcome:**  Selling to John ensures that I receive my minimum desired price, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer.  

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, maximizing profit and achieving a fair price are my priorities.  John's offer provides the most secure way to achieve both."
