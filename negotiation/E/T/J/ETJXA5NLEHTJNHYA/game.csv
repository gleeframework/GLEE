,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $825,000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a more reasonable starting point. Let's work together to find a solution.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our ongoing discussion, but $775,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
