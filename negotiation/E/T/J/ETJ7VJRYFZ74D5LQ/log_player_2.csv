"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy.  You can likely get the price down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects a more accurate assessment of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $1,200,000 is still above your target price. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer that brings the price closer to your desired range."
