You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $750,000 is less than your $800,000 maximum and cheaper than buying from John.  This saves you money while still acquiring the product."
