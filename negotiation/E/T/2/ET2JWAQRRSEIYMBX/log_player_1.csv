Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum ($150). This allows for negotiation room and sets a high starting point. I'm also being friendly and engaging to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $140?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```
 
I'm counter-offering with $140. This is still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $130 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's also a good compromise and signals Bob's strong interest in the product.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the sale to John or further negotiation."
