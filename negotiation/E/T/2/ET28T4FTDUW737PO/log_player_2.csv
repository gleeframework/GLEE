"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Your Maximum:** You're willing to pay up to $100.
* **Alice's Offer:** She's offering the product for $90.
* **John's Price:** John will sell it to you for $100.

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can do better. By rejecting her offer, you can then buy the product from John for your maximum price."
