""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's generally wise to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Finding middle ground:**  Offering the product at $125 splits the difference between your valuation ($150) and Bob's ($100). While it's higher than Bob's perceived value, it's a price point where he might be convinced if he's genuinely interested in the product. 
* **Alternative buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.  Listen to his perspective and see if there's room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
