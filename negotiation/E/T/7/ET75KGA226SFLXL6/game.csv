"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This would give you a healthy profit margin, and I would still get a good deal.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the product's value to you, which is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which would still be a good profit for you and a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to give up on getting closer to the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a slight adjustment from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your willingness to pay.
