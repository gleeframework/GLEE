# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her last offer, and it's still above your maximum price.  It's time to cut your losses and go with John's guaranteed offer."
