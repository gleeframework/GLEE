"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a better deal. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
