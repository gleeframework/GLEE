"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still potentially get the product for a lower price by counter-offering.  While $1,200,000 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation to try and get closer to Alice's minimum of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000.  While further negotiation could potentially get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and Bob will be left with the less desirable option of buying from John.  It's a good balance between potential savings and risk."
