"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $850000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $925000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable product and me to secure a reasonable return on my investment.

Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",900000.0,Alice,5,
