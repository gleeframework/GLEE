"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your offer, however, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. I'm confident this product can bring significant value to your business, and I'm willing to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ would you consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. While I agree this product would be valuable, $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. How about we try $900,000? ",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more significant move from your side. To be frank, I have other interested buyers. I can let this go for $1,300,000, but this is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
