Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your offer, however, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more significant move from your side. To be frank, I have other interested buyers. I can let this go for $1,300,000, but this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly holding firm on a price above our budget. Her latest offer is her ""final offer"" and she's introduced the pressure of other buyers. While she might still negotiate, it's unlikely we'll get her below $1,000,000, which is our absolute limit. John offers a guaranteed price at our maximum budget, making it the safest and most financially sound decision."
