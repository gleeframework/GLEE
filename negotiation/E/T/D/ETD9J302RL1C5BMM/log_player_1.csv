{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate down if needed. It's also a good starting point as it leaves significant value for Bob while ensuring I make a profit over my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  This still leaves a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $12,500 is still above my minimum threshold of $10,000 and represents a good deal considering we've negotiated. It's also the best option as I'm not sure if I can convince him to go higher, and I'm guaranteed a profit."
