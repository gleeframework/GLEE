Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $10000?  That's my absolute limit, and I'm confident we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($10,000), I'll choose to reject his offer and send a counteroffer.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $12500. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $11,000 is still lower than my initial offer, but higher than my minimum acceptable price, I'll choose to reject his offer and send a counteroffer.

However, I should also consider that Bob has mentioned that $11,000 is his final offer, so I might not get a better offer from him. In that case, I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.
