"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $10000?  That's my absolute limit, and I'm confident we can find a way to make this work.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500. This is my best counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $12500. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're willing to go up to $11000, Bob, but I'm still not sure if that's enough to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and my initial offer of $15000. I'll sell the product to you for $13000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
