Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has value,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product.  I think that's a fair price and reflects its true value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about the product's value. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is still a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.
