Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($1,500,000 vs. $1,200,000) allows for negotiation room.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's ""incredible value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing specific details.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let me know if you'd like to discuss further"" signals  willingness to negotiate,  giving Bob a chance to counter-offer. 

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts the initial offer, Alice gains a significant profit.
2. **Negotiate from a Strong Position:** Even if Bob rejects the first offer, Alice has room to decrease the price while still aiming for a price higher than John's guaranteed offer.
3. **Secure a Sale:**  Having John as a backup buyer ensures Alice will sell the product for at least its minimum value."
