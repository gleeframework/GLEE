"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
