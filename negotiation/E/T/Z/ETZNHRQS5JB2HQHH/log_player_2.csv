Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  It doesn't reflect the product's true value or the potential return it can bring.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure a fair deal for myself.  How about $1,600,000? This price allows for some negotiation space while still allowing me to make a profit.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,600,000. How about $1,520,000? I believe this price is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value and your needs."", ""product_price"": 1520000}"
