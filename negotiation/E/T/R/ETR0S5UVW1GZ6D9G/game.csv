"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my minimum price as possible. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product's value, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could potentially do $900,000. Would that work for you?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and your latest bid. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I've got another offer for $1,000,000. If you're able to match that, I'm ready to close the deal with you today.  If not, I'll need to seriously consider my other option.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you have another offer on the table, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,100,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this point. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal. If not, I'll need to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
