The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is asking for $200.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a lower price than what I'm willing to pay to see if I can get a better deal.  It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $175 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll keep negotiating to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming to stay below my maximum price."
