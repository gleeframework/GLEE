"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product for less than its full value, and I get a fair price. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would be a good compromise that still gives you a great deal on the product.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,250 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $8,750 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
