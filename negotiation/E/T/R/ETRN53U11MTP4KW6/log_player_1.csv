Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $2,000,000 is quite steep for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 falls significantly short of what I consider fair value.  To move things along, I'd be willing to come down to $1,750,000. This represents a significant concession on my end while acknowledging the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a fair offer considering my budget limitations.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my valuation, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
