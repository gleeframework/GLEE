Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate but also ensures I don't immediately sell to John for less.
* **Message:** I'm keeping it friendly and encouraging a response while also highlighting the value of the product. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  I'm trying to get as close to my minimum as possible.
* **Keep Bob engaged:**  A lower opening price encourages negotiation and allows me to adjust based on his responses.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** By offering a price lower than John's, I keep the option open if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.  It's worth trying to get closer to my minimum by making a counteroffer.  There's still a chance Bob might be willing to pay a little more to avoid losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering the price by $500, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget while still emphasizing the value of the product and making it clear that I'm willing to compromise to some degree. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain a reasonable profit:**  I'm trying to bridge the gap between my minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Encourage a deal:**  A moderate counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate and increases the likelihood of reaching a deal.
* **Keep the pressure on Bob:** By not immediately accepting his offer, I maintain some leverage and create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13500 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to come down to $13000? This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $500 away from my minimum of $12,500.  While I would prefer to get closer to my minimum, the negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and accepting his offer will allow me to finalize the deal.  There's always a risk that further negotiation could lead to a better offer, but there's also a risk that the deal could fall apart completely.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure a sale at a price that is still very favorable to me."
