Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, which is her guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, getting Alice closer to her ideal price.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product. 

**Why not higher?** 

Offering the product for more than $1,150,000 risks Bob immediately rejecting the offer. It's better to start with a price that seems reasonable to both parties and go from there."
