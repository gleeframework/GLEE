Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $115? Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

We're getting closer, but there's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $105 is the best I can do.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $105 is just a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $110?  That's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, and $110 is a reasonable price, saving $10 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly better results."
