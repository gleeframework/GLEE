Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be really valuable for you. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low. There's always a chance he might be willing to pay more than his perceived value, especially if it's something he needs or wants urgently. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A high initial offer gives us room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. It also makes us appear more flexible if we later lower the price.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John.  This means we shouldn't accept any offer below that price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. We need to be prepared to adjust our strategy based on Bob's response."
