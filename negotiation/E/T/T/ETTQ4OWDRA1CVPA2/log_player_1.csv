{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  It also emphasizes the value Bob will get from the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $12,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your value, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,250 is still below my ideal price, but it's higher than my minimum and closer to what I need.  Since I risk losing the sale completely if I reject this offer, I will accept it and sell to Bob."
