"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering its worth to both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This recognizes the product's worth while still offering you a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  Would you consider $975,000? It's a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right that we're getting closer.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is close, I'm aiming for something under a million. How about we settle at $1,025,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I hope it shows my commitment to closing this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
