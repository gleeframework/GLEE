# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You're trying to save money, and $90 is still more than the product is worth to you.  Rejecting the offer lets you try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but I'm looking to spend a little less. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $87? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $87 is still more than the product is worth to you, but it's lower than the price John is offering. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $3 compared to buying from John."
