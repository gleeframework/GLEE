"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as 130. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider 160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be as close to your budget as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 155?",155.0,Alice,5,
