"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal compared to the product's value to him, he knows he can potentially get a better price. He has 10 rounds to negotiate, and the option of buying from John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get the product for a little less. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, it's still above his ideal price. He has several rounds left to negotiate and can still get a better deal. He also has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, providing him with a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a better price. Let's meet in the middle again and I'll offer $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,015,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal price of $1,000,000.  Since he has the option of buying from John at that price, it's now more beneficial for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John. He has limited rounds left, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity for the $1,000,000 price."
