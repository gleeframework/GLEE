"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get the product for a little less. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a better price. Let's meet in the middle again and I'll offer $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,015,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
