"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I also have to consider my minimum price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm trying to stay within a tighter budget though. Could you do $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
