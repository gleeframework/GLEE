Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $720,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's try $850,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can move forward with the transaction. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $785,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm  willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $835,000, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. We have limited rounds left, and I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000, and we have a guaranteed option with John at that price. There's no point risking a worse deal by continuing with Alice."
