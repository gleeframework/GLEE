"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's still a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,150,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit closer to your comfort zone, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $1,225,000? This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
