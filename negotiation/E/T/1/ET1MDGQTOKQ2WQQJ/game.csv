"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement within this budget?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  To move this forward, how about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
