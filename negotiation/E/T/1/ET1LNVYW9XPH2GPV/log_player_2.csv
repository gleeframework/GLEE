"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, we believe it's worth $10,000. However, to make this opportunity more appealing, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an exclusive offer and won't be available after today. Don't miss out on this chance to secure such a valuable asset at a highly competitive rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.**  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, but Alice is asking for $9,500.
* **John is willing to sell for your maximum budget.** You can get the product from John for $10,000, which is within your price range.

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John allows you to stay within your budget."
