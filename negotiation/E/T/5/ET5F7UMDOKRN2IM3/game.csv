"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's the best I can offer at this time.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not quite there with your latest offer. Let's split the difference and settle for $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise, and it ensures we both walk away happy. What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $997,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",997500.0,Bob,6,
