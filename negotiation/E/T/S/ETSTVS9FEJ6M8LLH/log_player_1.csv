"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $80 to me. It leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not willing to settle for the minimum just yet. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his, and it gives me a bit more profit than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired amount in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'll stick with $90 for now. Since Bob has only offered $5 more than his initial offer, I'm hoping a bit of persistence will push him to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired amount in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

I'll counter with $89.  This is a small concession from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it will convince Bob to close the deal.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale entirely."
