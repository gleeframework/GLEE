"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $1200000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800000. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $900000? I believe this is a fair price that would benefit us both.",900000.0,Bob,4,
