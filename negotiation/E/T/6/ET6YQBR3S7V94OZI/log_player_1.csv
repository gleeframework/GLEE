"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to Bob ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to build rapport and encourage a successful negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to justify the price. 
* **Open Ended Question:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $8,000. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can use them to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's still above my minimum ($8,000) but closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Meet in the Middle:** I'm proposing a middle ground to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000.  Since we are nearing the middle of our negotiation rounds, it is best to accept his offer and close the deal. If I continue to reject his offers, I risk losing out on the deal completely. Selling to John at $8,000 would be a safe option, but accepting Bob's offer allows me to gain an extra $250."
