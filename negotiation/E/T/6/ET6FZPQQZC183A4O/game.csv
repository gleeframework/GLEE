"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and our respective needs.  I'm eager to make this deal work, but I'm not sure I can go higher.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",800000.0,Alice,5,
