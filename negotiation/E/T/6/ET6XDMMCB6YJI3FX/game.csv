"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but I need to be upfront with you - it's a significant investment. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1200000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1400000 is still above what I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, Bob. I can sell the product to you for $1350000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. If you're still interested, let me know.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
