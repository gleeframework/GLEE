Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $10,000 (her fallback price from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $2,000 to be made from Bob.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim to capture as much of the potential profit as possible without going over Bob's valuation. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth in the market."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation**

* **Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,500 leaves some room for negotiation but keeps Alice firmly within the profit zone.
* **Messaging:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and positioning the price as reflective of the market. This approach avoids being overly aggressive while still conveying a sense of confidence in the offer. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer. Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate but should stick as close to her desired price as possible.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is important for future dealings, Alice might consider a slightly lower price for long-term benefits."
