"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I believe it's only fair to propose a price that reflects its true worth. I am offering it to you for $10,000. This is a special offer considering the significant value this product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both her value and my maximum price. I should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's to try and understand her lower bound.  This offer is closer to Alice's value but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I would like to counter with an offer of $7,500 for the product. This price still reflects its value while accommodating your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above the midpoint between our valuations. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle at $6,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 6750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm inching my offer upward while still staying well below her current offer. This approach shows I'm willing to negotiate but not going to simply meet in the middle. It puts the ball back in Alice's court to see if she's truly willing to come down significantly from her initial ask."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $7,250. This price aims to balance both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, but I believe there's still room for improvement.  I'll hold firm and see if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I can go up to $7,000.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm making a smaller increase this time to signal I'm reaching my upper limit. This offer is still a good deal for me, and it puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your willingness to increase your offer, I am willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $6,875. This price reflects the product's value while allowing us to come to a satisfactory agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has essentially agreed to split the difference on our last two offers.  While I might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, this price is well below my maximum and represents a good outcome for both of us. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk pushing Alice too far and losing the opportunity."
