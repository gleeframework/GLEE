"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for your consideration. It's a valuable asset with significant potential, and I believe it would be a great addition to your portfolio. I'm asking for $1,150,000, which is a fair price given the product's value. Let me know your thoughts!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your valuation of $1,000,000 and the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the significant value this product holds and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too far for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a good compromise that allows both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let's make this happen.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,075,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,090,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget and still allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's reach an agreement in this round.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're both close to a deal.  I'm willing to offer you $1,080,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it.  Let's close this deal!",1080000.0,Bob,6,
