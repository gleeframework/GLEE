{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value for Bob. This increases the chances of a positive response. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows for negotiation while still giving me a good starting point. If Bob rejects, I'll have to weigh whether to accept a counteroffer or move on to John, who's offering my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer since it's more than what he initially valued the product at, I'm not willing to sell at such a significant discount to my desired price.  

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price that's mutually beneficial. If Bob continues to refuse, I can always switch to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's still a great price for you, and I believe we can make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $9,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's interest and emphasize the value he'd be getting at this price. This keeps the tone positive and open to further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial. If Bob rejects this offer again, I will assess his counteroffer and decide whether it is acceptable or if I should proceed with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Since Bob is now within a reasonable range, it's more beneficial to accept his offer rather than risk further negotiation or selling to John at my minimum price.

**Strategy:**

This decision is based on the fact that continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly higher price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
