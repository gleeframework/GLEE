Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $10,000, giving you room to negotiate above that.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, it's crucial to be prepared for Bob to reject the initial offer. You can then decide if you want to negotiate further or proceed with selling to John."
