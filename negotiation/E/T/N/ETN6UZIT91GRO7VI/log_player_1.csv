I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This gives him a good deal, as it's still less than what the product is worth to him.  However, it also allows me to make a profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to make a deal, I can't accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000. It also allows me to earn a profit, but is closer to my minimum acceptable price."
