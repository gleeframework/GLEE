"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's initial offer. You're looking to get the product for $100 or less, and $115 is too high. By rejecting, you can start the negotiation process and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $105. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm sure you'll find this product to be worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you another chance to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference again - I'll offer you $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $107.50 is still too low for me.  I'm confident this product is worth $112.50 to you, and it's a price that works for me. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $112.50 is still above your maximum budget of $100.  It's getting close, but it's time to cut your losses and move on.  John is offering a guaranteed price that fits your budget."
