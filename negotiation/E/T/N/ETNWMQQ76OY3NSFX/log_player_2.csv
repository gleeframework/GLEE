"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating.  There's no need to jump at the first offer, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good price. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a significant discount from her initial price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can likely still negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. That's a fair price that would allow both of us to make a profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 980000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $980,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I can offer you the product for $1,020,000. This is a fair price that should meet both of our needs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but you can still push for a lower price. You're still within your budget, and you have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise. I'm going to meet you halfway on this one and offer $1,000,000. That's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price that should meet both of our needs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you are comfortable paying, and you've already gone through 6 rounds of negotiation.  You're approaching your limit of rounds, and you're getting tired of haggling.  It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John, even though it's more expensive. You're guaranteed a purchase with John, and you're not sure you'll be able to get Alice to your desired price point within the remaining rounds."
