"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900000 is unfortunately below my minimum value for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1200000?  This price still allows me to make a fair profit while remaining within your budget.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price is a significant compromise, but it allows me to  make a fair profit while still remaining within your budget.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. I'm prepared to make a final concession.  How about we settle on $1050000?  This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  If you're unable to accept this price, I'll need to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
