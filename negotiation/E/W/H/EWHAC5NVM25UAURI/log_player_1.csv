I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $975,000. This is a compromise that meets him halfway, and still gives me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is now lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident I can push him higher.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
