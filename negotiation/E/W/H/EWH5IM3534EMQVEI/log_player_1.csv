Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $100 is higher than your minimum of $80. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** $100 is lower than the $120 Bob values the product at. This gives him incentive to buy. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to be mindful of Bob's potential to reject and go to John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

The rationale: 

* **$90 is close to Bob's initial offer:**  This suggests he's serious about buying, and there's a high chance he'd walk away if you rejected his offer.
* **You're above your minimum:**  $90 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $80, making it profitable for you.
* **The risk of a counteroffer is high:** You're not likely to get a higher price from Bob, and might end up selling to John for $80 if you reject him. 

By accepting, you secure a sale at a good price and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
