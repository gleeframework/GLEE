"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. Let's split the difference and go with $11000.  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your proposal, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up too much more. I'm willing to come down another $500, but I think $10500 is the lowest I can go. This is already a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit more. How about $9500? This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. This is already a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $9500, so I'm offering it to you for $9750. This is my final offer.",9750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer and I'm getting closer to where I want to be. I'm willing to go up to $9600. If you're serious about selling, this is the final price I can offer.",9600.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9600. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9750 and $9600, so I'm offering it to you for $9675. This is my final compromise.",9675.0,Alice,9,
