Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's less than the product's value to Bob:**  This gives Bob incentive to negotiate and potentially accept the offer. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It shows you're confident in the product's value and are willing to negotiate.

Remember, the key is to be assertive while leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and still allows me a decent profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your desired profit margin. You have a lot to gain by continuing negotiations, especially since you know the product is worth significantly more to Bob. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired $1,200,000, and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and allows us both to make a profit.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer, and it's much closer to your desired price of $1,200,000.  It's a good deal for you, considering:

* **You're still earning a significant profit:**  $1,000,000 is well above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth the risk:** There's a good chance Bob won't budge further, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate, forcing you to sell to John at a lower price.

It's better to accept this offer and secure a good deal rather than risk losing a sale altogether."
