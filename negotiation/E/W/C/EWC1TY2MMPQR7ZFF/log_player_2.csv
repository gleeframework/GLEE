"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a special opportunity tailored to your needs, considering its value to you is $10,000. I believe this price reflects the quality and benefits of the product while providing you with a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $12,000 is closer to my maximum budget than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and is aware the product is worth less to me. By rejecting this initial offer and making a counteroffer, I can try to secure a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. I am willing to negotiate further. How about we aim for a price of $10,500? This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while offering you a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down considerably from her initial offer, and $10,500 is a reasonable compromise. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price below my initial maximum and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
