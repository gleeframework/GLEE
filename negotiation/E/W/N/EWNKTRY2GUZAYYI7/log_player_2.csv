"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $1,000,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a better deal. You have the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, but it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is very interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is closer to your maximum price point, it's still above your target. You've already established a willingness to pay $1,000,000, and John is willing to sell at that price.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice and risking her refusing another counteroffer, which could lead to a higher price or a dead end. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price."
