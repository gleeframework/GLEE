"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2000000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1600000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1600000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can do $1800000, which is a compromise between our two numbers. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1800000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to pay $1700000, which is a fair middle ground. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1750000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a compromise. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1725000, which is a fair compromise given our previous offers. If this works for you, let's close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to move forward with John's offer.",1725000.0,Bob,6,
