"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives you a fantastic deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 still isn't close enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $975,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this deal and move on.",975000.0,Alice,5,
