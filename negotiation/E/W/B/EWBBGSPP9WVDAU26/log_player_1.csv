{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price allows for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a terrible deal. It encourages continued negotiation.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm aware John is willing to pay $15,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. This position gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to reject low offers and push for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I can come down to $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and benefits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm willing to come down from my initial offer but still maintain a margin above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Attractive price:** $10,000 is a reasonable price that might be appealing to Bob, especially if he sees the value of the product.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still aiming to keep my budget at $8,000. Could you consider going even lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has repeatedly insisted on $8,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited Negotiation Space:** Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a satisfactory price for me.  
* **John is a better option:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, guaranteeing a good outcome. It's more efficient and less time-consuming to sell to John.

Selling to John is the best course of action to maximize my earnings."
