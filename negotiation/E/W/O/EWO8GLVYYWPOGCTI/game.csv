"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I can do $11500, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I've already gone as low as I can. I'm not willing to meet you at $10900. However, I'm willing to make one final offer: $11200, or I can sell the product to John for $8000. The choice is yours.",11200.0,Alice,9,
