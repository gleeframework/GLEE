"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and your potential profit margin. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $17,000 is too high, and he can likely get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product to me. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $15,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. There's room for further negotiation, and he has multiple rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a compromise from both of our perspectives. Let's see if we can reach a deal here."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $14,250. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $14,250 is a good price considering his budget and the value of the product to him. It's within his price range and he's likely to get a good return on investment. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer is increasing, and it's unlikely Alice will come down much further."
