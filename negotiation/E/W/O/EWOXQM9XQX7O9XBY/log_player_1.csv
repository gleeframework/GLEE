"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and your potential profit margin. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product to me. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob. There are still 8 rounds remaining, so I have room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a compromise from both of our perspectives. Let's see if we can reach a deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$13,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still below it. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I have 6 rounds remaining, and I'm not in a rush to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $14,250. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14250}
