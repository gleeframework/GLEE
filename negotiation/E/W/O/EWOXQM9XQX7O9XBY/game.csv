"Alice, $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a compromise from both of our perspectives. Let's see if we can reach a deal here.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $14,250. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,5,
