""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $135. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have."",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while staying above our minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $135 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Alternative Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so there's no pressure to go below our minimum.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and ensuring we don't lose out on a sale by overpricing the product."
