Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.  I'm aiming for a win-win scenario where Bob gets a good deal, and I maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think $90 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than $80. I'll counter his offer to try and reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $85. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm countering with $85, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still hoping to get it closer to my budget. How about $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $82 is very close to my minimum price of $80, and it's still a good deal for me.  It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than risk further negotiation or potentially losing out to John."
