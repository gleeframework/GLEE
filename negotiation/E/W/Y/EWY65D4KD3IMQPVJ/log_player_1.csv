"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my minimum acceptable price, so there's room to bargain.

I'm confident I can get a better price than John's $12,000 offer, but I also want to be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Room for Counter-Offers:** There's a substantial gap between our positions, allowing for several rounds of negotiation.
* **Seeking a Better Price:** I'm not willing to accept such a low price, and I believe I can achieve a more favorable outcome through continued negotiation.  

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, but I'll also be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't become more reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by reducing my price from $10,000 to $9,500.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, emphasizing that this price is still fair.
* **Collaborative Tone:**  I'm using phrases like ""find a solution"" to create a sense of partnership and encourage further negotiation. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while ensuring I don't settle for an unacceptably low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** The gap between our positions is shrinking, but there's still room to push for a better price.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. 

I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. This is a fair price that recognizes both the value of the product and your budget constraints. Let's finalize this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise, demonstrating flexibility. By meeting him halfway, I show willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum price. 
* **Fairness and Value:** I reiterate the value of the product and emphasize the fairness of my offer.
* **Urgency:** I use language like ""finalize this deal"" to subtly encourage Bob to act. 

This counteroffer should demonstrate my willingness to be reasonable while still prioritizing my financial goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,250. It's a fair price that takes into account the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer, while slightly higher, is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** The gap between our positions is becoming smaller, but there are only 4 rounds left.
* **Risk of Losing Value:** Selling to John guarantees a profit, and Bob's offer is not yet close enough to justify the risk of continuing.

While I want to get the best possible price, I also need to consider the possibility of walking away and securing a guaranteed sale with John.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price, but if Bob doesn't meet me halfway, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,250 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,750, which is a fair compromise that considers both our positions.  Let's make this deal happen â€“ we're both close to an agreement! "", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a significant reduction from my previous offers, demonstrating a strong willingness to compromise. It's also close to my minimum acceptable price, so there's not much more room for me to budge.
* **Urgency:** I reiterate the idea that we're close to an agreement to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The remaining rounds are limited, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the guaranteed offer from John. This offer balances the need to close the deal with the desire for a good price.

I'm hopeful this offer will be enough to convince Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to my budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,200. It's a fair price that takes into account the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the risk of not securing a deal with Bob is increasing.
* **Minimal Gain:** Bob's offer is only slightly higher than his previous offer, and it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired $12,000, which is a much more secure outcome.

While I'd prefer to reach a deal with Bob, the risk of continuing negotiations with him and ending up with a lower price is too high.  John's offer is a safe and profitable option."
