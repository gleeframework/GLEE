"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $150 by me due to its unique features and high-quality craftsmanship. Considering its worth to you is $100, I believe we can find a fair deal here. I am proposing to sell it to you for $120. This price not only reflects its value but also allows you to save $30 compared to my initial valuation. I'm confident this offer will be beneficial for both of us. Please let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Alice,1,
