Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is above my minimum value ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also suggests I'm confident in the product's value and am willing to compromise slightly.  I'm eager to see if Bob accepts, but I'm prepared to counter his offers if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my initial offer and is still above my minimum threshold of $10,000.  It's in my best interest to accept and avoid the risk of further negotiation and a possible lower price."
