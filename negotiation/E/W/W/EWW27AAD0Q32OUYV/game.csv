Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.,20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'd like to get a better deal. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $17000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is still a bit higher than your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $14000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. I'm getting close to my budget, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Can you consider this offer?",11000.0,Bob,6,
