Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to sell ourselves short. Starting with a higher offer leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows us to secure a price closer to our desired amount.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value and our preference to sell it directly to Bob.  
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so we're not desperate. This allows us to be firm in our negotiation with Bob.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** We get a great deal at $12,000.
* **Bob negotiates:** We have room to lower the price, potentially settling somewhere between $10,000 and $12,000.
* **Bob rejects:** We sell to John for our guaranteed $10,000."
