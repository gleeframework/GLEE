"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are aiming to get the product for under $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price to $750,000. This is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer, and signals my serious intent to negotiate a fair price. It also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still above my limit. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal.  I'm still aiming for a price below $800,000 and have several rounds left to achieve this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $800,000. This is my maximum limit, but it's still a significant discount from Alice's last offer.  I'm hoping to close the deal at this price. If Alice rejects, I'll be forced to buy from John, but at least I've tried to get the best possible price from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $820,000 is still above my target price of $800,000.  While there are still rounds left, I've reached my limit and am not willing to pay more.  I've made multiple counteroffers and shown my willingness to negotiate, but Alice has not met my price. 

To avoid further negotiation and potential delays, I'm choosing to buy the product from John for my maximum price of $800,000."
