Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, at $110, knowing it's more than the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still making more than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still do better.  I'm willing to go another round of negotiation to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $105. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it still leaves me with a profit above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be attractive enough to Bob while still being a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $95. While it's still less than I initially hoped for, it's a fair price that allows me to make a profit and avoid the risk of another round of negotiation that might lead to me having to sell to John for $100."
