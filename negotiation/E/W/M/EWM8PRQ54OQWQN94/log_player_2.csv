"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) to give us room to negotiate upwards.  
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Goal in Mind:** Our goal is to get as close to $12,000 (our maximum) as possible, but we'll see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** Alice's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to our budget, but it's still above what we can get it from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** We have some room to negotiate, especially since we have multiple rounds left and the option to go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for getting closer on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $12,500.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $11,250?"",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  We're proposing a price that's exactly halfway between our last offer ($10,000) and Alice's current offer ($12,500). This shows a willingness to compromise while still moving us closer to our target price.
* **Remaining Firm:** We're not immediately accepting her offer because we know we have other options and time on our side. 
* **Encouraging a Deal:** By suggesting a specific price and framing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" we nudge Alice towards making a decision and potentially accepting our counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,250.  I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $12,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  This price reflects the true value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement so we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:** Alice has come down to our maximum price of $12,000. 
* **Matching John's Offer:**  There's no point in continuing the negotiation since we can get the same price from John.
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice changing her mind or the negotiation breaking down in later rounds."
