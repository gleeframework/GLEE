"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for getting closer on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $12,500.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,250.  I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $12,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  This price reflects the true value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement so we can finalize this deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
