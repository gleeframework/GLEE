"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its true value to me is significantly higher. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is still quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $1,050,000? I believe this is a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer. This gives us room to move upwards while staying within our budget.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $1,050,000, we're aiming for a price significantly below Alice's starting point but still leaving space for negotiation. This shows we're serious but want a good deal.
* **Market Reference:** Mentioning ""market value"" subtly reminds Alice that other options might be available, even if we haven't explicitly threatened to go with John's offer yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, her counteroffer of $1,250,000 is still slightly above John's price. We have some leverage and haven't revealed our absolute bottom line yet. We should push for a price closer to John's offer before considering accepting."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $1,150,000? That's a significant step from my initial offer, and it brings us closer to a deal we can both feel good about."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Progress:** We're incrementally moving towards a price that works for us, showing we're engaged in the negotiation.
* **Compromise:**  While $1,150,000 is closer to Alice's offer, it's still a substantial discount from her initial price, maintaining pressure.
* **Positive Language:**  We use phrases like ""significant step"" and ""deal we can both feel good about"" to encourage agreement while staying firm."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still not quite at a point where I can feel comfortable selling the product.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and reflects a significant compromise on my part.  Let's close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reached our absolute bottom line.  While we've successfully negotiated her down significantly, it's unlikely she'll go any lower. Since John offers the product at the same price ($1,200,000), we might as well buy from him. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice for no additional savings."
