"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its true value to me is significantly higher. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $1,050,000? I believe this is a fair offer considering the market value.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $1,150,000? That's a significant step from my initial offer, and it brings us closer to a deal we can both feel good about.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still not quite at a point where I can feel comfortable selling the product.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and reflects a significant compromise on my part.  Let's close this deal.
