Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $1,050,000? I believe this is a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
