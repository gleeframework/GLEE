Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $135. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting you in the middle, or accepting your initial offer.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason like ""great deal for something of this quality"" adds a bit of persuasion without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his willingness to pay. If he rejects it outright, you can always lower the price slightly, knowing you have John as a backup."
