{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can save at least $2,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating further.  You know the product is worth less than $10,000 to Alice, so there's room to bargain."

``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still potentially save more money by rejecting and counteroffering. There's still a difference between Alice's valuation ($8,000) and her offer ($11,000)."

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows a willingness to meet halfway, while still leaving a decent profit margin for Alice."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is the best you can get without risking buying from John for a higher price. You've saved $500 compared to John's offer.  Further negotiation may lead to a lower price, but it's not guaranteed and could cost you time."
