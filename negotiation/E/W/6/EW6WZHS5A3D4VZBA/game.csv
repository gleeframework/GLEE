"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is too far from what I'm willing to accept. I have another buyer interested at a much higher price. If you can do $14,000, the product is yours. Otherwise, I'll have to go with the other offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I have a firm budget.  My best and final offer is $11,500.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",11500.0,Bob,6,
