"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate! Alice's starting offer is way too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much negotiating room there is.  We have plenty of rounds to work something out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While closer, $16,000 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer, but still aiming to stay well below my $12,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is too far from what I'm willing to accept. I have another buyer interested at a much higher price. If you can do $14,000, the product is yours. Otherwise, I'll have to go with the other offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is getting trickier.  Alice is trying to pressure me, but I'm not going to fold just yet. I'm sticking to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I have a firm budget.  My best and final offer is $11,500.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal right now."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

This is a tough spot.  I'm raising my offer slightly, but being very clear about my limit and my willingness to walk away. Let's see if Alice blinks!"
