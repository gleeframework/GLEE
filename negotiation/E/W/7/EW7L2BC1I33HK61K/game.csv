"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, $65 was probably a bit low.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $85. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
