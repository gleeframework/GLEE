{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I highlight the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, giving me the chance to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm aware of John's offer of $1,200,000, so I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000 unless I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's initial offer is far too low, it shows that he is willing to negotiate. There is still room to find a price closer to my target.
* **Avoiding John's Deal:** Selling to John would guarantee $1,200,000, but I want to see if I can get closer to that figure with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll gain.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob:** I'm lowering my price to $900,000, signaling a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to Bob to reinforce the deal's attractiveness.
* **Seeking Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing a desire for a solution that benefits both of us, promoting a collaborative approach.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose too much. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be more agreeable to Bob, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed. I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob is getting closer, $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's willingness to meet in the middle shows that he's committed to the deal, suggesting further negotiation is possible.
* **Avoiding John's Deal:** I'm hesitant to sell to John right now, as I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll need to be strategic, balancing my need for a good price with my desire to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $750,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $825,000. This price reflects the value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's latest offer ($750,000). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Fair Deal:** I'm framing the price as a ""fair deal"" for both of us, emphasizing the mutual benefit.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't settle for a significantly lower value.
* **Keeping Bob Engaged:** This counteroffer is likely to be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer, keeping him engaged in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping this offer will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on his response. I'll continue to analyze his motivations and the potential for further compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
