"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

 Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to move on the price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By starting low, I'm signaling that I'm a serious buyer but also looking for a good deal. It puts the negotiation more in my favor.
* **Alternative Option:**  I have John's offer of $800,000 as a backup plan.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll gain.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, but it's still significantly higher than John's price. 
* **Negotiating Power:** It's clear that Alice is motivated to sell, so I have some negotiating power. By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to walk away unless the price gets closer to my target.
* **Backup Plan:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000 if negotiations with Alice stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's a significant jump from my previous offer but still below Alice's current offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while moving closer to a potential agreement.
* **Time Sensitivity:** I'm aware that negotiations can drag on, and I want to avoid that. By making a more substantial counteroffer, I'm hoping to accelerate the process and reach a deal quickly.
* **Acceptable Range:**  While $750,000 is above my ideal price, it's within an acceptable range, especially considering the potential savings compared to Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $750,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $825,000. This price reflects the value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Savings:**  While I could try to negotiate further, Alice's offer of $825,000 is only slightly above John's price of $800,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns at this point. There's a chance Alice could walk away, or the negotiations could drag on.  
* **Time Value:**  Securing the product now at a reasonable price outweighs the potential for saving a relatively small amount."
