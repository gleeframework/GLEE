"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value while still being a fair deal for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that you're getting a good deal as well. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $12,500 is a good price, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500 to make this work.  It's a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could potentially get a lower price by counter-offering, there is a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and then increase her price again.  At $13,500, Bob is getting a good deal, and it's worth taking the sure thing rather than risking a stalemate with Alice."
