"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that you're getting a good deal as well. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $12,500 is a good price, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500 to make this work.  It's a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,
