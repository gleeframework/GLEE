"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that you're getting a good deal as well. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $12,500 is a good price, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500 to make this work.  It's a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
