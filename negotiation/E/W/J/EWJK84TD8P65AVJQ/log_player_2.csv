"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal, and I believe you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her product's worth to her, it's still more expensive than John's offer of $1,200,000.  Bob can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
