"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, but also sets a high initial value for the product.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and what his perceived value might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm aiming to find a price that's closer to my initial asking price, while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's better to accept and secure the sale than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
