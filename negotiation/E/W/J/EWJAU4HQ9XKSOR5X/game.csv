"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me is $8000.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget while still reflecting the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $11000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me is $8000.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to my maximum budget. If I don't get to $10000, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8000. I'd like to try to reach a deal with you, but I need to be within my budget. Can you meet me at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000, but I need to make it clear that this is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept. If we can agree on this price, I'm willing to move forward with the sale.",11000.0,Alice,7,
