Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should counteroffer Alice and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,250.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
