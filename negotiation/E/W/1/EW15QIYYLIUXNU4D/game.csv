"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product,  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,250.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,3,
