"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Bob's Reaction:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and potential for reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintain Optionality:**  You haven't revealed your minimum price or your ability to sell to John, keeping your options open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. After evaluating its value, I believe a fair price would be $1,000,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that is satisfactory for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While closer to his perceived value, $1,000,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a substantial gap between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, indicating room for further negotiation. 
* **John as Leverage:** You still hold the option to sell to John for your desired price, giving you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly below the value I place on this product. I'm willing to move from my initial price, but I need to see a more realistic counteroffer. Would you consider $1,400,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Measured Concession:** You've lowered your price by $200,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still remaining firm on a price above your minimum.
* **Encouraging a Realistic Counter:** By stating Bob's offer is ""significantly below"" your valuation, you nudge him towards a more serious offer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You're still holding back from revealing your absolute bottom line or your John alternative, preserving your negotiation power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's perspective, and I appreciate her willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's unique features and potential, I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000. I hope this offers a compromise that benefits both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Acceptable Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 exceeds your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, securing a profit.
* **Strong Counteroffer:** Bob's increase demonstrates a serious interest in closing the deal.
* **Time Value & Risk:** Continuing negotiations prolongs the process and carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures the deal."
