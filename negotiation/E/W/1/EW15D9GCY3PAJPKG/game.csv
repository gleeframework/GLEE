"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $125. It's still a great deal for both of us!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $115. Let's see if we can close this deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $130. It's still a great value for the product, and I think it's a fair price.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $130 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference and I'll take it for $120.  This is my final offer.",120.0,Bob,6,
