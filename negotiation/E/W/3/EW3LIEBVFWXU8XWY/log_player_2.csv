"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to meet your needs. Given its quality and features, it's valued at $150 by me. Considering its worth to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is starting at her full asking price, which is far more than you're willing to pay.  Buying from John at $80 gets you the product at your target price."
