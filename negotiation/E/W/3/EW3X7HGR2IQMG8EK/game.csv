"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can we meet in the middle at $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15000 is still too low for me.  How about $16500?  That's a significant drop from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for us.  $14000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference and go with $15250.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product is worth the investment.",15250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $15250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13500. That's the highest I'm willing to pay, so I hope we can meet at this price.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, and I respect that. However, $13500 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $14500, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but $14500 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. My final offer is $13000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Bob,8,
