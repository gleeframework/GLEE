"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its incredible value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Starting with a significantly higher price than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation.  It also establishes a strong initial position.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity but invites Bob's perspective to assess his level of interest and flexibility.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By aiming high, Alice signals the product's importance and sets the stage for potential concessions in later rounds while keeping the option of selling to John open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than Alice's initial asking price. By rejecting this offer, Alice signals that she believes the product is worth more and is willing to negotiate further to secure a better deal.  There's still ample room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I recognize you see the value in this product, $1,200,000 undervalues its unique potential.  I could consider a price of $1,400,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** Alice acknowledges Bob's offer and moves closer to his price, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, the reduction is substantial, demonstrating she's serious about getting a strong price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The language emphasizes the product's unique aspects and ""potential"" to justify the higher price, subtly reminding Bob of what's at stake. 
* **Pressure Point:** By Round 3, Alice is creating a subtle sense of urgency. While not explicitly mentioning John, the limited rounds suggest she has other options if an agreement isn't reached soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Return:** $1,350,000 represents a substantial profit over Alice's minimum price and is a good compromise from her initial ask.
* **Deal Momentum:** Bob is clearly engaged and making reasonable concessions. Accepting now capitalizes on this positive momentum before he potentially lowers his offer or disengages. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** While holding out for more is tempting, there's a risk Bob could significantly decrease his offer in later rounds. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
