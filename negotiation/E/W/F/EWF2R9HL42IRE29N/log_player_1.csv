Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point, as it's more than my minimum of $80 but still leaves some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that little profit yet.  I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90.  This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's current offer.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement on this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $82 is only slightly more than what I could get from John, it's worth it to avoid the hassle of further negotiations.  Bob is clearly not willing to pay more, and I don't want to risk him walking away completely.  This is a reasonable compromise."
