"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,500?  Let's see if we can make this happen.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $13,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $13,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $13,250? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",13250.0,Alice,5,
