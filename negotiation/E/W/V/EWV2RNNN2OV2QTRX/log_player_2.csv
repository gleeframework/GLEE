"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, you might be able to get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down to a price closer to her $80 value."
