"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $16,500 is my lowest offer. If you're serious about buying, let's meet in the middle.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,500. How about $13,750?",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $13,750, I'm willing to meet you at $15,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,5,
