"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($8,000) and John's offer ($8,000). 
* There's significant room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting this initial offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Lowball:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) creates room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating your price limit. It doesn't completely shut down the negotiation.
* **Open for Counteroffers:** By saying ""Let me know if that works for you,"" you encourage Alice to continue the conversation and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved closer to your range, $9,000 is still above your $8,000 maximum and higher than John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests she might be willing to go lower.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** You have the security of John's $8,000 offer, giving you a strong position to push for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $9,000 is still a bit out of reach. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Moving from $6,000 to $7,000 shows willingness to negotiate but in smaller increments, signaling you're getting closer to your limit. 
* **Reiterating Fairness:**  By mentioning a ""fair offer,"" you subtly remind Alice that you're looking for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Maintaining Open Communication:**  The tone remains polite and encourages Alice to counter, keeping the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Limit:** Alice's latest offer of $8,500 is still above your $8,000 maximum budget. 
* **""Lowest Offer"" Signal:**  Alice stating this is her lowest price indicates she's unlikely to budge further. 
* **John's Offer is Better:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000, which is more favorable than Alice's final offer. 

At this point, it's strategically better to take John's offer and avoid potentially overpaying."
