{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  It's significantly lower than John's price, but there's room for negotiation. 
* **More information is needed.**  We don't know how much Alice values the product.  Rejecting allows us to gather more information about her willingness to negotiate. 
* **Time is on our side.** With 10 rounds, we can afford to be patient and explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating our seriousness about getting a good deal. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility and see if she's willing to budge.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** If Alice rejects this offer, we can adjust our next counteroffer based on her response."
