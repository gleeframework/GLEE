Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a price that's still below its worth to you, and I get a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the value the product offers to Bob. This is important in framing the offer positively. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves space for Bob to counteroffer without immediately triggering a deal with John. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If the negotiation drags on, I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. Bob recognizes the value of the product, and his counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay more than his initial perceived value.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $1,500,000 gives me confidence to push for a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price closer to my desired amount. I'll use the fact that Bob is willing to pay a premium to my advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, and I see you value the product. However, $900,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  While I won't accept Bob's initial offer, I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a price halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I still have a higher price point than Bob's offer, keeping John's offer as a fallback.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I continue to highlight the value Bob will receive with the product, reinforcing the rationale for a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's Response:** I'll analyze Bob's next move and adjust my strategy based on his response.
* **Consider John:** If Bob continues to be stubborn, I'll have to weigh the potential of a lengthy negotiation with the certainty of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my means. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and is closer to my target, $950,000 is still below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  There's still potential to negotiate further. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and his willingness to pay a premium suggests he could be persuaded to go higher.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John, which provides me with leverage in these negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a final counteroffer, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired amount. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll have to seriously consider selling the product to John to ensure I receive my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to go a little further. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This would be a great deal for both of us â€“ you get a premium product at a price within your budget, and I can secure a fair deal. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase at a higher price. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer. It creates a sense of urgency and potentially pushes Bob to make a decision.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm still holding firm on a price above Bob's offer but now closer to his perceived value.  
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have another buyer willing to pay more, creating pressure for him to accept.
* **Framing a Win-Win:** I'm focusing on how this deal benefits both of us, presenting it as a positive outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'll have to decide whether to accept John's offer and walk away from the negotiation.
* **Decision Time:**  I'll carefully weigh the potential of further negotiation with Bob against the certainty of John's offer."
