"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a price that's still below its worth to you, and I get a fair price. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, and I see you value the product. However, $900,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my means. Can you consider this revised offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to go a little further. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This would be a great deal for both of us â€“ you get a premium product at a price within your budget, and I can secure a fair deal. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase at a higher price. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
