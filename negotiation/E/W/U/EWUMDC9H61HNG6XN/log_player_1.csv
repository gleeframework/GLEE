{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is lower than Bob's perceived value but higher than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I profit from the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired profit.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $12,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $12,000, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $11,250 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John is offering, and it's closer to my desired profit margin."
