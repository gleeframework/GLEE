Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly below what I value the product at, leaving some room for negotiation.  However, it's also above what Bob values the product at, giving him an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it. It's a fair price considering I have other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I need to get closer to my minimum value of $10,000. I'll counteroffer and try to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $8,250 is getting pretty close to my minimum value.  It's a reasonable compromise, and accepting this offer ensures a sale without risking losing the deal completely."
