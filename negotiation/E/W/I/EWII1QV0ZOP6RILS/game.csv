"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm excited about its potential. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  However, the value this product brings to the table is immense.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,200,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I think $1,150,000 is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential for you. I'm willing to accept $1,250,000 as my final offer. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair given the value you'll gain.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
