"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price. It's unlikely he'll come close to $18,000 if I counter.
