"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While I'm definitely interested, I'm aiming for a slightly lower price. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original price. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,800 is still a bit out of my range though. Would you consider $10,600? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10,700, but that's as low as I can go. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",10700.0,Alice,5,
