"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $1,200,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to reach a more reasonable price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit far from $1,300,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000, which is the price I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
