"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique nature and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing it further.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $1,800,000 is a strong offer, the value this product holds goes beyond that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $2,025,000?",2025000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $2,025,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
