"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above your limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if you can both find a price that works."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to get a good return on my investment while also being competitive with your offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still slightly above your limit. You have more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to push for a lower price.  You can also use the knowledge that you can buy the product from John for $1,000,000 as leverage in your negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I think the product's value is worth more than what you're offering, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,025,000. I'm willing to make a compromise and offer the product to you for $1,012,500. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my limit. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've already gone through several rounds and I'm not sure if I can push her lower. John is offering a price that is within my budget and I don't want to risk losing out on the product by continuing to negotiate with Alice. It's better to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with rather than risk going over my limit."
