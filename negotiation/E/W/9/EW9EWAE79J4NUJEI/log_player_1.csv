Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price still leaves a good profit margin for you and allows me to acquire the product at a price that works for my budget. What do you think?
