This offer gives Bob a good deal, as it's below his estimated value of $1,000,000. However, it still allows me to get closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
