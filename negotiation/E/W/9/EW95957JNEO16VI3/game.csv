"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this deal work.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $1,100,000 is closer to what I was hoping for, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for its value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
