"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is still above Bob's budget of $10,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Bob can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer of $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $10,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal.  If negotiations don't go in Bob's favor, he can always buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm thinking of a price of $12800. It's a compromise that meets me halfway between my previous offer and your latest offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer of $12,800 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $10,000. Bob has three rounds left and can continue to negotiate. There's still a chance he can get a better deal, or he can always buy from John for $10,000 if he's not satisfied with the progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. However, $12,800 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm thinking of a price of $12200. It's a compromise that meets me halfway between my previous offer and your latest offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time is Running Out:** Bob only has one round left.  
* **Alice's Price is Too High:** Alice's offer of $12,200 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's offer of $10,000 is a guaranteed price within Bob's budget.

It's better for Bob to secure the product for $10,000 from John rather than risk another round of negotiation and potentially miss out on the deal entirely."
