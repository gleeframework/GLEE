"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be willing to go for that?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $105.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target. How about we meet at $108? It's a small increase, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",108.0,Alice,5,
