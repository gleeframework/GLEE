The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $90. You can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $92. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

While $92 is closer to your ideal price, it's still above your desired range. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $88? I'm really serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $95. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're willing to meet me at $95, I'd be happy to sell it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

While $95 is better than John's price, it's still a bit higher than your desired range. You have room to negotiate further with Alice, especially since she seems willing to compromise."
