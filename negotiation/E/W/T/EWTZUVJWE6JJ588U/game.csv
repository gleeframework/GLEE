"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $92. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $88? I'm really serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $95. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're willing to meet me at $95, I'd be happy to sell it to you.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference at $91? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",91.0,Bob,6,
