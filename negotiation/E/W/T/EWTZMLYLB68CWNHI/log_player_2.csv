You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider $17,000?  I'm willing to negotiate to find a fair price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my bottom line. How about meeting in the middle at $14,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, her ""final offer"" of $14,000 is still more than John's offer of $12,000. It makes more financial sense to buy from John at this point and avoid potentially frustrating negotiations with Alice."
