"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider $17,000?  I'm willing to negotiate to find a fair price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $11,000? That's a fair offer, considering I can get it elsewhere for $12,000.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my bottom line. How about meeting in the middle at $14,000? This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
