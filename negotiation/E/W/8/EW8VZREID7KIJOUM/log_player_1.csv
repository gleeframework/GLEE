This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving room for negotiation.  It also expresses confidence in the product's value, which might influence Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."

While $8,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
