"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special price of $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount considering its true value, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Please let me know your decision by [date/time]. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer at full market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her stated value, it's significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a better alternative: buying from John at $800,000. 

**Important Note:** Alice's statement about selling to another buyer at full market value is likely a negotiation tactic. Don't let it pressure you into accepting an unfavorable deal."
