"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $12,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer is also $12,000, there's no immediate benefit in accepting. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer of $10,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Alice will be willing to compromise a bit to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a $1,000 reduction from her initial price. This is a good deal for me, considering my maximum budget is $12,000. I'm happy to accept this offer and save $1,000."
