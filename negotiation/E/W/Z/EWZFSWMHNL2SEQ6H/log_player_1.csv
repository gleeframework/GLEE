Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than John's offer, making it appealing to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation if he's willing to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired value of $1,000,000. I will counter-offer to try and secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer, but I'm confident that this price is still fair considering the product's value to Bob. This counter-offer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.  While it's not the ideal price, it's a good compromise considering the potential of further negotiation.  There's a chance I could get a higher price if I reject this offer, but there's also a chance I could end up selling to John for less.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a good profit and minimizes the risk of getting a worse deal."
