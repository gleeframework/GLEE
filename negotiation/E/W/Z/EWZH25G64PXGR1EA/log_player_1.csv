"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $8,500, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,200 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. While selling to John for $8,000 is tempting, I think there's still a chance to get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my last offer, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,200 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $8,700 for the product. This is a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll be very satisfied with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8700}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,400 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit below my ideal price, we're getting close to a deal.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from John.  I'm happy to take $8,400 and close the deal."
