"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has a maximum budget of $1,200,000 and wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,150,000 is within Bob's budget, but he can potentially get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. If negotiations fail, Bob can always fall back on John's offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,200,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and he may be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without further negotiation."
