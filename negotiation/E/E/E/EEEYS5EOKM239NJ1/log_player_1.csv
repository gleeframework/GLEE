Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I believe it's a fantastic deal and will be very useful for you."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $150 for the product if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150, which matches my minimum acceptable price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob, potentially ending up with a lower price or a stalemate."
