,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a chance to reach an agreement.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $140. Can you meet me there?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $140 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $150. This is my final offer, as I have other interested buyers waiting.",150.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $150. I'd be willing to go up to $145, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",145.0,Bob,6,
