"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  $175 is a significant discount from my minimum value, giving Bob room to counteroffer while still allowing me to make a profit.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to highlight the value of the product and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I still have 9 rounds remaining. I can counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $150, I believe I can still get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a chance to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a counteroffer to Bob, showing my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $175 to $160, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing that this price is still a good deal for Bob and that finding an agreement is a shared goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $140. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, especially since we have 6 rounds left.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $150, I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations to try to reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $140 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $150. This is my final offer, as I have other interested buyers waiting."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is framed as my final offer, adding a sense of urgency.
* **Meeting Halfway:** While $150 is my minimum, I'm framing it as a meeting point, acknowledging Bob's offer while maintaining my bottom line.
* **Competition:** I'm mentioning other buyers to create a sense of scarcity and urgency, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $150. I'd be willing to go up to $145, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the chance of negotiating a price higher than $150 is dwindling.
* **Small Margin:** Bob's offer of $145 is only $5 higher than his initial offer, indicating limited room for further negotiation. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and a reasonable outcome. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether and ending up with nothing."
