"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer you $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $825,000 is still within my budget.
* While I would prefer to pay less, it's getting close to my desired price point.
* It's a good deal considering the alternative of buying from John for $1,200,000.
*  There's a chance that continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal entirely to John is too high. 
*  It's important to weigh the potential savings against the possibility of losing the deal altogether."
