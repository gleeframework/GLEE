"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still above my target.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product, and it also allows for a healthy profit for you. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can close this quickly.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer you $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
