Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting frustrated, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I can offer you $74, and I think it's a fair compromise. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge below $74.  She's trying to wear you down, and you're running out of rounds.  It's time to cut your losses.  While John's offer is higher than you'd like, it's better than risking Alice holding firm at $74 or higher, leaving you stuck with a worse deal or nothing at all."
