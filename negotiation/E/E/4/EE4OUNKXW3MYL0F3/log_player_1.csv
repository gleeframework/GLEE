Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value and your potential profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for the price, highlighting the product's value and Bob's potential profit.
* **Leaving Room:**  This allows for potential counteroffers and negotiation without immediately triggering a rejection. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** The presence of John gives me a safety net, enabling me to end the negotiation if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only justify going as high as $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's still interested. There's room for negotiation. 
* **John as a backup:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through. 

**Next Steps:** I will send Bob a counteroffer to bridge the gap between our positions, hoping to reach an agreement closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $800,000 is below what I need, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  This gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher. 
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I reiterate my willingness to compromise, signaling that I'm open to finding a solution.
* **Highlight Benefits:** I emphasize the benefits for Bob, mentioning a ""good deal"" to encourage his acceptance.
* **Keep John in Mind:** The $1,050,000 offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, allowing me to walk away if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range.  To be honest,  $1,000,000 is the very highest I could go.  It's a great product, but I have to factor in my costs as well.  If that works, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $1,000,000 is still below my ideal price, it is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good outcome considering Bob's initial low offer.
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:**  Bob has stated his absolute limit.  Further negotiations are unlikely to yield a higher price.
* **Risk of Losing a Deal:** Rejecting this offer might risk losing a deal with Bob altogether, potentially forcing me to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting allows me to close the deal quickly, rather than continuing a drawn-out negotiation. 

**Conclusion:** 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice considering the circumstances. It ensures a sale at my minimum acceptable price, avoiding potential delays and the risk of a deal falling through."
