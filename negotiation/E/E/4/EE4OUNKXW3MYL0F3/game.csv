"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $800,000 is below what I need, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  This gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range.  To be honest,  $1,000,000 is the very highest I could go.  It's a great product, but I have to factor in my costs as well.  If that works, I'm ready to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
