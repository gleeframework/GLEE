,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $16,000 for the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only comfortable going up to $14,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and your desired selling point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $16,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $14,000 and $16,000. I'm offering the product to you for $15,500.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not quite there. I can go up to $14,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this item. Let's close the deal.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $15,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm offering the product to you for $15,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",15250.0,Alice,7,
