Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $9,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm being positive and encouraging to build rapport.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going straight for my minimum price of $10,000, as this might scare Bob away.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation.  I'll consider the time it takes to negotiate versus selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  
* **Time is a factor:** I need to balance the potential for a better deal with the opportunity cost of negotiating further. If I can quickly get closer to my desired price, continuing makes sense. However, if negotiations drag on, I may be better off selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a final agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at $8,500.
* **Encouraging a quick decision:**  I'm hoping to avoid a prolonged negotiation by offering a price that's likely to be more appealing to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to reassess. If he makes another offer that's closer to my desired price, I might accept. However, if he seems unwilling to budge, I'll likely sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $8,500 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you be willing to do it for $8,000? That's the most I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $8,000 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a higher price, but it also risks wasting time and potentially losing the deal altogether.
* **Time is valuable:** It's important to consider the opportunity cost of continuing to negotiate.  If I sell to John, I can get $10,000, but that might take longer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and sell him the product for $8,000. This is a good outcome, as it's close to my minimum and allows me to move on quickly."
