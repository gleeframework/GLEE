"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  While $9,000 is close to my limit, there's still room to save some money before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves room for me to increase my offer if needed, while still staying well below my $8,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a final agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still over my ideal budget. I'll try to push for a slightly lower price before accepting or resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $8,500 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you be willing to do it for $8,000? That's the most I can offer."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

This counter-offer accomplishes a few things:

* **Signals my limit:** By stating this is the ""most I can offer,"" I signal to Alice that this is my final price.
* **Remains polite and appreciative:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Matches John's offer:** This lets Alice know I have an alternative option if we can't agree."
