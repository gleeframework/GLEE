"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $8,250? This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. ",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product. I'm offering you the product for $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",8000.0,Alice,5,
