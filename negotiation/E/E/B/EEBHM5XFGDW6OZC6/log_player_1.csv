Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000,  you start by aiming higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than your guaranteed price.
* **Creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity:**  By mentioning a public listing, you nudge Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing""  signals that there might be some flexibility in the price, encouraging Bob to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still providing a potential win for Bob."
