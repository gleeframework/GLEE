"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $10,000 for this.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you need to get a fair price. How about $9,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and puts us closer to the middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is closer to my desired price, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and settle on $9,500. That way we both get a fair deal. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've come down quite a bit, and I respect that. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9,500.  I understand we're both trying to find a compromise.  How about we settle on $9,400? This way we're both closer to our target price. What do you say?",9400.0,Alice,7,
