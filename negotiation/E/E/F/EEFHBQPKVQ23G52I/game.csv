"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $11,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you place on the product. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,3,
