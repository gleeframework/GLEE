"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($120). This suggests there's room for negotiation. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $135 is a good compromise. It's still within your budget of $150 and closer to your ideal price of $130.  Accepting her offer secures the product for a fair price and avoids potentially lengthy back-and-forth negotiations."
