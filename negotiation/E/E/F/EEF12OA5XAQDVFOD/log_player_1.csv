``` 

This offer starts at a high point, but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that you are willing to work with Bob, which can lead to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $130 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the price."", ""product_price"": 135}
