"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of the product's value. While I respect your budget constraints, I must maintain a certain level of profitability for the product. Therefore, I am unable to accept the proposed price of $8000. I am willing to negotiate further, but I must insist on a minimum price of $10500 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets within your considerations and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

While I would like to accommodate your request, maintaining a fair price for the product is crucial for both our interests. I am willing to consider a price closer to your suggested amount, but I must insist on a minimum of $9750 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on the product and ensures a reasonable return for my investment. I hope this revised offer is more in line with what you're looking for, and we can move forward with a transaction that benefits us both.",9750.0,Alice,5,
