Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm emphasizing the value and potential of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Building a Relationship:** I'm starting with a friendly tone to create a positive negotiation environment. 

I'm aiming for a quick deal but am prepared for counteroffers.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price closer to the value of the product. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my target.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer maintains my leverage and allows me to control the negotiation.

I'm going to counteroffer in the next round with a price closer to my desired value. I'll try to close the deal before reaching the 10th round, but I'm ready to sell to John if necessary to secure my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our interests. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to accept.

I'm aiming to close the deal in this round by offering a price that's close to my minimum, but still profitable for me.  If Bob rejects, I'll reassess my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought, and I'd like to propose $1,025,000 as a fair price for the product. It's still below the asking price, but I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:**  Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I still believe I can secure a higher price.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price of $1,075,000.
* **Time Remaining:**  We still have several rounds left, giving me the opportunity to explore further options.

I'm going to counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming to find a middle ground that is more appealing to Bob while still ensuring I get a profitable deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a great opportunity for you, and it ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a touch of urgency by stating, ""Let's finalize this."" This subtly implies that I may be willing to accept John's offer if we don't reach an agreement soon.
* **Emphasizing Benefits:**  I'm reminding Bob of the benefits of buying the product at this price, emphasizing that it's a ""great opportunity.""

I'm aiming to secure a deal in this round.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to reconsider my strategy and potentially make a decision about selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I think we're getting closer. I would like to propose $1,030,000 as a fair price for the product. It's still slightly above my initial budget, but I believe this is a reasonable compromise.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:**  While Bob's offer is only $20,000 less than my previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I maintain my position and signal that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Time is on my Side:**  We still have several rounds remaining, giving me the opportunity to potentially push for a higher price. 

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, aiming to push towards my desired price point while acknowledging his willingness to negotiate. I'm also considering the risk of running out of rounds and having to sell to John, which will be my fallback option if I can't secure a more profitable deal with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and we're getting very close. How about $1,040,000? This is a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 1040000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm proposing a price only $10,000 higher than Bob's last offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable deal for me.
* **Time Factor:** I'm subtly reminding Bob about the limited time remaining and emphasizing the need to reach an agreement.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm again highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to see the potential of this deal.

This is a calculated risk. If Bob rejects, I will have to decide whether to accept his next offer or sell to John. However, I believe this offer is a good middle ground and that Bob is likely to accept."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost There:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still determined to push for a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John would guarantee me $1,000,000, there's still a chance to secure a better deal with Bob. 
* **Two Rounds Left:** With two rounds remaining, I have the opportunity to continue negotiating without significant risk.

I'll make a final counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price of $1,040,000. If Bob rejects, I'll have to weigh the potential of a counteroffer against selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time, but I'm still confident we can reach a deal. Let's make it $1,040,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1040000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm clearly stating that this is my final offer, adding a sense of urgency and emphasizing that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options (selling to John) if we can't agree,  increasing the pressure to accept.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  I'm sticking to my previous offer, hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and finally accept.

This is a high-stakes round. If Bob rejects, I'll have to make a difficult decision in the final round: accept his counteroffer or sell to John.  However, I'm still optimistic about reaching a mutually agreeable deal with Bob."

(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:**  This is the last round of negotiation, and I have to make a final decision.
* **Close but Not Enough:**  Bob's offer is only $2,500 lower than my desired price, but I'm not willing to risk selling below my minimum.
* **Secure the Deal:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant profit.

While it's disappointing to not secure a higher price with Bob, selling to John is the most sensible choice in this situation. It protects me from further negotiation and ensures a safe and profitable deal."
