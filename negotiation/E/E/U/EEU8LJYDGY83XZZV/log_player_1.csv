"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm confident that I can negotiate down from here if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to get $80, I believe I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. It's still above my minimum, but hopefully, he'll see the value in paying a bit more."
