# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is a good deal, but I can potentially get it for even less. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price again."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $750,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping for, but it's a good deal considering the value of the product to me. I'm confident I can get a better price from another seller, but it's unlikely that I'll find a deal this good. I'm going to accept the offer and avoid the risk of finding a worse deal."
