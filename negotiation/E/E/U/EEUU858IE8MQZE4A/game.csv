"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $750,000? This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows us both to achieve a successful outcome.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
