"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product with you. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently prepared to pay.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,150,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and a fair compromise considering the value of this product. I believe this price allows for a good deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $1,100,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll reduce the price to $1,125,000, which is a small increase from your last offer. I believe this is a fair price that meets us in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
