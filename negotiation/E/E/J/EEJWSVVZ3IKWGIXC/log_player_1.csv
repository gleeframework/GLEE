"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price, as that's what I would get from John if the negotiation fails. This gives me the best chance of securing a good deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take the $900,000, I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,100,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to accept his offer yet. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still holding out for a better deal than Bob's latest offer. I'm hopeful he'll see that I'm serious about negotiating and meet me halfway."
