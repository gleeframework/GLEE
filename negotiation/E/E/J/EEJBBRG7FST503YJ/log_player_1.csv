Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Aiming for a price close to his valuation maximizes potential profit while leaving Bob with a perceived gain.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he wants. It's unlikely he'll go as low as $800,000, your guaranteed price from John. 
* **Strong but Respectful Language:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity without being overly aggressive."
