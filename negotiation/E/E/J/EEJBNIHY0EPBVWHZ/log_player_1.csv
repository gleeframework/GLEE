{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you.  I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it. I understand this is a substantial investment, but I'm confident the product's potential will justify the price.  Please let me know if you're interested in discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $1,500,000. This gives me room to potentially negotiate higher, while still being above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Message:** The message is designed to be:
    * **Intriguing:**  I use phrases like ""unique"" and ""significant value"" to pique Bob's interest.
    * **Confident:** I express confidence in the product's value,  which could subtly influence Bob's perception.
    * **Open to Discussion:**  I invite Bob to discuss further, leaving room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Gain:**  The higher price allows for a more lucrative sale if Bob is willing to pay.
* **Minimize Risk:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for my minimum value."
