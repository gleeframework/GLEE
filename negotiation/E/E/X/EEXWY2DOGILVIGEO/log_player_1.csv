Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $140 is higher than $120, so Bob has some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $140 is above your minimum of $150, so you still have room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's a clear starting point:** This offer establishes a price point and initiates the negotiation. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd love to sell to Bob, his offer of $125 is too low for me.  I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $150.  John is a guaranteed sale at that price, so I'll take it.  Thanks for your time, Bob!"
