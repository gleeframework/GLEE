Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer. This should be a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $925,000, which is a fair compromise. This would allow me to get closer to my target price while ensuring a good deal for you. Let's work together to close this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your financial constraints, but $910,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $915,000. This is a very fair price, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly committed to negotiating and has consistently lowered her price. At $915,000, she's made a significant concession from her original $1,100,000.  While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk she'll become less willing to negotiate or that the deal could fall apart.  

This offer represents a good balance of getting a discount while securing the product."
