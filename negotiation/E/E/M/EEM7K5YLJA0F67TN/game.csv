"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $12,000.  Would that work for you?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I also need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go as low as $16,000. This is my final offer on that end. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price.  To be honest, $16,000 is still a stretch for me.  I could potentially do $13,500, but that's really the absolute highest I could go.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $13,500. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, but I'm still optimistic. I can see that you're serious about buying the product, so I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $14,500. This is my best and final offer on the higher end, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this price.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this.  $14,500 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $14,000.  Would you be willing to settle there?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in the conversation. I understand that $14,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not getting the price I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $14,250, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. This is a serious offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be willing to go any lower. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,7,
