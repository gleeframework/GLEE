Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I also need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go as low as $16,000. This is my final offer on that end. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $13,500. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, but I'm still optimistic. I can see that you're serious about buying the product, so I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $14,500. This is my best and final offer on the higher end, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in the conversation. I understand that $14,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not getting the price I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $14,250, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. This is a serious offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to push the price as high as possible. While we might be able to get it a little lower, the difference is now small enough that the risk of losing the deal isn't worth it.  Accepting at $14,250 is a decent compromise and saves us money compared to John's offer."
