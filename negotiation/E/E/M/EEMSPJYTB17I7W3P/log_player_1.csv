Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $170. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the maximum he's willing to pay and matches what John is offering. There's no point in further negotiation.  It's best to sell to John and avoid potential haggling with Bob."
