Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than what Bob is willing to pay but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and highlighting the potential benefits for both of us.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not setting a hardline price, allowing for Bob to counteroffer.
* **Protecting my minimum:** This price is above my minimum of $120, so I'm not losing money even if Bob accepts. 

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation. I'm prepared to lower the price slightly if needed, but I'll also keep John as a backup option if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even below what the product is worth to Bob. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is not acceptable, it indicates he is willing to pay something.  This gives me an opportunity to counteroffer and try to reach a compromise.
* **Keeping John as a backup:** Rejecting Bob's offer doesn't mean I'm giving up on him completely. It gives me more leverage in the negotiation, but I still have John as a guaranteed buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $90 to make this work for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price. This demonstrates flexibility and encourages further negotiation. 
* **Reasoning for the counteroffer:** I'm providing a specific reason for my counteroffer, tying it to the desire for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not setting a hardline price, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer again if necessary. 
* **Protecting my minimum:** This price is still above my minimum of $120, ensuring I don't lose money even if Bob accepts.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while maintaining my own interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $65 was a bit low.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to lose money on this sale.
* **Opportunity for a final counteroffer:**  Bob's willingness to compromise suggests he might be open to a slightly higher price. This gives me a chance to counteroffer one last time.
* **John is still a safe option:**  If the negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for $120, so I have a backup plan.

By rejecting this offer, I aim to push for a final compromise closer to my desired price, while still retaining John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $75 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $85? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very useful."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final offer, as I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Fair compromise:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect, highlighting that this price is a middle ground between our positions.
* **Positive reinforcement:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how it will benefit him, hoping to motivate him to accept. 
* **No room for further negotiation:** By stating it's my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling that further negotiation is unlikely. 

This counteroffer is intended to be my final attempt to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Bob. If he rejects it, I'll move forward with selling the product to John."
