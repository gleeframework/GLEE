Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $75 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $85? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very useful.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85 and that's above your maximum price. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
