"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers, while still being a significant profit for me. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and what his perceived value is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm still hopeful that we can come to a mutually agreeable price, but I won't settle for such a low figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm offering $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I won't go lower than my minimum value.  If Bob is truly interested, he should be willing to come up from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's an improvement, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value. I will counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,000,000.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It's also above my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for some compromise.  I'm hoping this signals that I'm serious about closing the deal while also encouraging Bob to raise his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is inching closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I believe there's more room for negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price before I run out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to offer $900,000. This is still above my minimum price but shows flexibility. I'm hoping this demonstrates that I'm serious about selling while also pushing Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer."
