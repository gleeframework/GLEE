Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is to establish a baseline and gauge her willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget of $800,000, but I'm starting lower to give myself room to negotiate upwards if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay my maximum budget of $800,000. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll move on to buying from John. I think this is a fair price given the previous negotiations and the fact that I have an alternative offer from John."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  While I'm close to a deal, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk going another round and possibly getting stuck with a higher price. John is offering a guaranteed price within my budget, so it's the best option for me."
