"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate downwards while still maximizing my potential profit. It's also important to remember that John is willing to pay $15,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk by starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm looking to make a deal, I can't sell it for less than $15,000 as that's the guaranteed price with John. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it still gives me a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."

I'm making one final counteroffer at $14,500. I'm getting close to John's offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this price.  If he rejects, I'll have to sell to John."
