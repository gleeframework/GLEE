"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

$75 is a good price, but I'm aiming to save even more. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price halfway between Alice's offer and my maximum budget. This shows I'm serious about negotiating but also leaves room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further rounds potentially resulting in a higher price or running out of rounds makes accepting this offer the most sensible choice. I'm still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
