{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a good price, but also leaving room for negotiation.  $20,000 is a significant markup from my minimum, but it allows for potential counteroffers.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $18000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still not ideal.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $18,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise with Bob. I'm willing to drop my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  We'll see if he's willing to meet in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $17500. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $17,500 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further. I'll try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $17,500 is just a little too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This would be a final offer from my side.  Let me know if you're able to accept this."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to make one final counteroffer to Bob at $18,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum and hopefully enough for Bob to make a decision.  If he doesn't accept, I'll have to move on to Plan B and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16500. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made multiple concessions and it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's the best option at this point to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
