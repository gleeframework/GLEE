"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it presents a fantastic opportunity for you.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another interested party waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is below her stated value, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage John's offer to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed to buy from John and save $250,000."
