"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price while I can still receive a significant profit. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, however. How about $1,000,000? This still gives you a significant savings compared to your initial value of $1,500,000, and allows me to achieve a fair price. Let's try to work together on this.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
