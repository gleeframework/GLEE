Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is still below what the product is worth to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for a bit of room for negotiation, while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation and might encourage Bob to be more receptive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer is only $10 less than my initial offer and still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Avoid potential loss:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a chance Bob might walk away, leaving me with only the $80 offer from John. 
* **Time and effort:**  Accepting Bob's offer saves time and effort compared to continuing the negotiation."
