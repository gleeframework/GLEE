Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I propose a price of $2,000,000. This is a rare chance to acquire something truly unique."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can confidently start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially still landing you a higher price than John is offering. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  There are many valid approaches, and the best one depends on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiating style."
