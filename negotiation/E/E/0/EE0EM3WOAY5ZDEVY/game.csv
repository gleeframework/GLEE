"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $200, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $80, which is my maximum budget. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $170. This is a great deal for you, and it's still above my minimum value.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I can offer $100 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $100 is just too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $135.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  I hope we can finalize this deal.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $115 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum value. Let's finalize this deal!",125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting close to my budget limit.  I can offer $120 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.  If not, I'll need to purchase from John.",120.0,Bob,8,
