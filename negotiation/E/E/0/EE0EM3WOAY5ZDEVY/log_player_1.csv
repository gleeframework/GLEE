"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $200, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and maximize profit. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $80, which is my maximum budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to make a sale, $80 is significantly less than my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $170. This is a great deal for you, and it's still above my minimum value.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 170}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I can offer $100 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than $80, it's still far below my minimum value of $150. I will continue to negotiate, hoping to reach a more profitable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $100 is just too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $135.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  I hope we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still too low. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  There are still rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $115 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum value. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my budget limit.  I can offer $120 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.  If not, I'll need to purchase from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $120 is getting close to my minimum value, I only have two rounds left and I want to maximize my profit.  Selling to John for $150 is a better option than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting a lower price or ending up with no sale."
