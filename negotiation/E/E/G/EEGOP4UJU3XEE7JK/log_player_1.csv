I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a price that's higher than John's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm taking a calculated risk, hoping that the product is worth more to Bob than $10,000, but I'm protected by John's offer if he doesn't accept."
