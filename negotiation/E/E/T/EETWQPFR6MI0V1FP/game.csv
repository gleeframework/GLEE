"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1000000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to your business.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss something closer to $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $500000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $750000, reflecting a substantial discount.  This is a fair price, considering the product's potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $600000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference and go with $650000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
