"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to your business.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a high starting offer, but it's important to start strong and leave room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also open to negotiation if Bob counteroffers. It's also important to establish a good rapport with Bob right from the start.  I'm confident I can get a good price for the product within the 10 rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss something closer to $500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $500,000 is a significant sum, it's far below the product's minimum value to me ($800,000).  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can secure a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $500,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $750,000, reflecting a substantial discount.  This is a fair price, considering the product's potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $1,000,000 to $750,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.  This helps maintain my leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is worded to invite further discussion and a potential meeting point.  I want to keep the conversation going and avoid an impasse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to propose a price of $600000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $600,000 is closer to my minimum value, I still have room for negotiation. I believe I can push for a higher price, particularly since I have more rounds to work with.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $600,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference and go with $650,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This tactic shows Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway.  It creates a sense of fairness and increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I emphasize the word ""compromise"" to highlight the mutual benefits of this price. 
* **Direct Question:** I end with a direct question to keep the conversation moving forward. 

By making this counteroffer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to be flexible, while also trying to secure a price closer to my desired minimum. I'm confident this offer will encourage Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the market and the value of the product, I'd like to propose a price of $625000. This seems like a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $625,000, which is very close to my desired price and just above my minimum value of $600,000. I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for a lower price. Accepting this offer is the most practical choice, as further negotiations may not yield a significantly better outcome."
