"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Since Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, there's room for a counteroffer.  Rejecting the initial offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering, but I'm looking to get it for a little less.  How about $10,500? That's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will bring me a lot of value."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go.  This product is truly top-notch and will bring you a great return on your investment.  What do you say?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a better price than what John is offering ($12,000). It's also likely that Alice won't go lower, so accepting her offer is the best strategy to secure the product at the lowest possible price."
