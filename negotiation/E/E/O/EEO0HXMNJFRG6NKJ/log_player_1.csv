Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $115 offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, which might make Bob more inclined to accept or offer a counteroffer close to my asking price.

I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response before deciding whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can secure a better price.  I'll counter with an offer that's still appealing to Bob but edges closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering $110 splits the difference between his counteroffer ($105) and my previous price ($115), making it a fair and potentially appealing compromise.
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price point still ensures I make a profit above my minimum.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept. However, I'm prepared to walk away if he continues to push for a lower price, as selling to John for $100 is still a viable option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting closer, Alice.  I could do $107, but that's really pushing it for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $107 is now close enough to my desired profit margin. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk he might walk away. It's better to secure a good deal now ($107) than potentially lose the sale and only get $100 from John."
