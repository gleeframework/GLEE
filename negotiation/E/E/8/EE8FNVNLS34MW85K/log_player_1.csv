Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm confident that I can reach a deal with Bob that benefits both of us, but if he rejects my initial offer, I'm ready to counter-offer or walk away to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I will reject his offer and counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter-offer with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a price that ensures a healthy profit for me. Hopefully, this offer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than my initial asking price, it's significantly higher than selling to John.  It's worth taking this deal to avoid further negotiation and ensure a good profit."
