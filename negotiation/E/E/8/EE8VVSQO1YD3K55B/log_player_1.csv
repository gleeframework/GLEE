Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential value I see in this product for my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
