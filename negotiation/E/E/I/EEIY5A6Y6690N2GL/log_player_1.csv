Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still securing a great deal for you. 
* **Consider the Alternative:**  You have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so the offer to Bob must be enticing enough to forgo that certainty. 

This offer balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the situation."
