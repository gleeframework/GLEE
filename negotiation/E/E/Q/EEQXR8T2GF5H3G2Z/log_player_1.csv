Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $125. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $150, there's a chance Bob would reject it.  Offering it at $125 gives Bob a perceived good deal (a $45 ""discount"" from my initial asking price) and significantly increases the chances he'll accept. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** This price point allows me to capture some of the value difference between what I value the product at ($150) and what it's worth to Bob ($80).
* **Alternative Buyer:** I always have John as a backup who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, so there's limited risk in aiming a bit higher with Bob."
