"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I could get elsewhere.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for my budget right now.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1 million to make this work.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. Would you be interested in $825,000?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you compared to what you'd have to pay elsewhere.",825000.0,Alice,5,
