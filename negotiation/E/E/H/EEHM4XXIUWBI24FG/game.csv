"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's unique features.  However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $11500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now.  I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",11000.0,Bob,4,
