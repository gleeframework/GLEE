I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that aligns with your interests. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This price is still well within my budget and allows for a fair margin for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,300,000.

I believe it's a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
