"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This price is still well within my budget and allows for a fair margin for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market demand. I believe it's a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
