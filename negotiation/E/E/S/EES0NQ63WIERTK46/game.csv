"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's in both of our best interests to make a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,550,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
