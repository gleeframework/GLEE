"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $9,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a backup:**  Having John's offer as a safety net allows you to be more aggressive in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $7,500. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This price is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price:**  You're aiming for a price closer to $7,500, and $8,500 is still above that. 
* **Negotiation room:**  You have 7 rounds left, which provides opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price.
* **Backup option:**  Remembering John's offer gives you leverage to decline offers that aren't sufficiently appealing."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000? This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to make a deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm offering the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is moving in the wrong direction:**  Despite your counteroffer, Alice has increased the price from $8,500 to $9,200, which is not helpful to your goal of saving money.
* **You're still within your budget:**  You have several rounds left, and your goal is to stay below $12,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open.
* **John's offer is a good backup:**  You can always buy from John if a better deal isn't available with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to reach a certain price, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up slightly to $8,200. This is a fair compromise that meets us halfway. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 8200}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,200. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is not getting closer to your desired price:** Alice has been stuck at $9,000 for two rounds, showing that she's unlikely to budge further.
* **You're running out of time:** You only have three rounds left, and the negotiation is not progressing.
* **John's offer is the safest option:**  Buying from John at $12,000 guarantees you get the product within your budget, and you don't have to risk wasting more time with Alice. 

It's time to cut your losses and secure the product. While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price with Alice, the risk of not getting a deal at all in the remaining rounds outweighs the potential savings."
