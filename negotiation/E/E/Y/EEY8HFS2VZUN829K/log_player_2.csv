"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $10,000. There's no point in accepting it. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $12,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and within my budget, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I believe I can still negotiate a lower price and will try to make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $13,000.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.  I believe this price is fair and gives both of us room to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is still a bit more than I would ideally like to pay, it's getting very close to my budget. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's likely Alice won't budge much further.  It's a good price for a product I value, and accepting now means I avoid the risk of a longer negotiation and the potential of Alice rejecting my future counteroffers. I also want to avoid having to go through with buying from John as his price is still more appealing to me than the $13,500 price."
