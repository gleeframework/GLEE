"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible product at a discounted rate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, Bob can still get a better deal by rejecting and buying from John. Here's why:

* **Alice's profit:** Alice is willing to sell for $900,000, making a profit of $100,000.
* **John's price:** John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, making a profit of $200,000.

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can force Alice to lower her price, potentially leading to a better deal.  Even if Alice doesn't lower her price, Bob can still buy from John and save $100,000 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
