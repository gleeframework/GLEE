Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a price significantly higher than my minimum allows room for negotiation and leaves more potential profit for me.
* **Positive Tone:** A positive message encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value subtly suggests it could be worth more than what I'm asking. 
* **Open to Counteroffer:**  The message leaves the door open for negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  The strategy will depend on how Bob responds. I'll be ready to adjust my approach based on his counteroffers and my knowledge of the market."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000.  Let me know if that's a starting point for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm open to negotiation, $750,000 is below my floor of $800,000.  I cannot accept this offer without losing money.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting, I can continue negotiations and hopefully push Bob closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Even if negotiations fail, I have John's guaranteed $800,000 offer as a backup.

**Next Steps:** 

In the next round, I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, while still acknowledging his willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While $750,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant saving compared to my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a Compromise:** I'm lowering my price, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **""Middle Ground"" Language:**  This suggests flexibility and opens the door for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to gradually bridge the gap between our positions while keeping a buffer for potential further concessions.  Depending on Bob's response, I'll be ready to either adjust my counteroffer again or accept if we reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $825000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum of $800,000.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Further negotiation could potentially yield a higher price, but it risks delaying the sale and potentially losing Bob as a buyer altogether.
* **Safe and Secure:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a profit above my floor.

**Strategy:**

While I could try to push for a higher price, the risk of losing Bob's deal and ending up with John's lower offer is too high. This is a good deal that secures a profit and minimizes risk."
