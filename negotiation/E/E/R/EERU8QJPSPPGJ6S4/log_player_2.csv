"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, it's still a significant markup from her perspective (she's making a $150,000 profit). By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away and potentially find a better deal. This puts you in a stronger position to negotiate a lower price with Alice or resort to buying from John for a lower price."
