"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500. How about $9,000? Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer to my price point.  I can see we're both willing to compromise.  How about $9,250? That's a small step up from your offer, and I believe it's a fair price for a product of this quality.  Let's see if we can close this deal this round!",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250. How about $8,875? Can you consider that?",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway once more. How about $9,062.50? This would split the difference between our last two offers.  Let's see if we can make this work!",9062.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, $9,062.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $8,900? Can you consider that?",8900.0,Bob,8,
