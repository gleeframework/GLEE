"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a steal considering its value to you, and I'm confident we can strike a deal that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that considers its value to both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,050,000? That's still a great deal for you considering its value, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm trying to get the best deal possible. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and puts us closer to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
