"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I could get from another buyer. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. That's my top offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $850,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000?  This is still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen!",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I think I can get a better deal elsewhere. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $887,500. That's my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",887500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $887,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
