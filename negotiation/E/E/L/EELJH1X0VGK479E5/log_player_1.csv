{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my earnings.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and focuses on the value the product holds for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I clearly indicate that I'm open to negotiation by asking for his thoughts. 
* **Plan B:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can always fall back to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum threshold of $10,000, suggesting there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting his offer allows me to gauge how serious he is about buying the product. If he's genuinely interested, he'll likely counter again, potentially raising his offer.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  While $12,000 is tempting, selling to John right now would result in a lower profit.  By continuing the negotiation, I have a chance to earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is still a little lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I signal that I'm not willing to accept his price but am still open to negotiating. 
* **Middle Ground:**  The offer of $13,500 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.  
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly tone, emphasizing my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  This counteroffer keeps the door open for further negotiation if Bob rejects, while still giving me a profit above my minimum target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price point. How about we try to get closer to my original offer of $12000? Can you do $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $500 away from my last counteroffer of $13,500. This indicates a significant willingness to compromise.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum target of $10,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a higher price, but there's also a risk that Bob could walk away or lower his offer further. Accepting his current offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
