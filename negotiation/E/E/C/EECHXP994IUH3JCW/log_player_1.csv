Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You've stated the product is worth at least $10,000 to you, so this offer ensures you're making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still space for Bob to bargain if he feels the price is too high.
* **It's a fair initial offer:**  The price is close to the middle ground between your minimum and Bob's perceived value. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $11,500. You're aiming to get the best possible price, and $10,500 isn't ideal.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price from $11,500 to $11,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness:**  This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his proposed price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to encourage him to accept this offer."
