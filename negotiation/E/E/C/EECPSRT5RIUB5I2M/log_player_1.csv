"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This initial offer will likely be rejected, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation and signals my high valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent amount, I'm still significantly higher than Bob's valuation. I need to push for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm lowering my price but staying above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly. This price point should encourage him to come closer to my desired value."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiations, aiming to reach a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, showing flexibility and a willingness to find common ground. This offer is still higher than Bob's last offer, but it signals that I'm serious about closing the deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject this offer and try one more time to push for a better deal.  If it doesn't work, I'll sell to John and guarantee myself my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm willing to hold firm. If Bob rejects this, I'll move to sell to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I've reached a point where I'm not confident Bob will go higher. I'm willing to accept a lower price, but I want to guarantee my minimum desired value. Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
