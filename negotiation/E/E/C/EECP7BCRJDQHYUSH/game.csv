"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,500? It's a fair price, and it allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,4,
