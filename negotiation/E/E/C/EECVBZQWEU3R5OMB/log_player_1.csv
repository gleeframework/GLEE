Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $180 represents my initial asking price, I'm open to finding a middle ground. Could you consider $160? It's a slight reduction on my end but still reflects the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

It's unlikely Bob will go much higher and it's not worth risking a lower counteroffer. Accepting John's offer of $150 ensures you get a fair price."
