"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $12,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down in price, $9,500 is still too high.  It's worth rejecting and seeing if we can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers - how about $9,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $9,250. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, $9,250 is still more than I want to pay. It's better to go with John's offer at $8,000 and secure a deal that works for me."
