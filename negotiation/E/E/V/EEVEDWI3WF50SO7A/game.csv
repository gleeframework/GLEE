"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $12,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers - how about $9,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $9,250. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount.",9250.0,Alice,5,
