"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $175 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $155. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $135 is a fair price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
