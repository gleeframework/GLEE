Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will get $1,500,000 from John, so she shouldn't sell for less than that.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Opportunity for Profit:** There's a potential profit margin because Bob values the product less than Alice's guaranteed sale price.

**The Offer**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000 
}
```

**Why this might work:**

* **High Starting Point:**  It anchors the negotiation closer to Alice's desired outcome.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is above Bob's valuation, it leaves space for some back and forth.  
* **Value-Oriented Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value, not just the price.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Key:** This offer is a starting point. Alice should be prepared to negotiate, but she should not go below her $1,500,000 minimum.
* **John as Leverage:** Alice doesn't need to disclose her deal with John, but it provides her with a strong alternative if Bob refuses."
