Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price.  $775,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle at $812,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $812,500.  It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
