Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  A $950,000 offer allows for some potential counteroffers from Bob without jeopardizing my minimum goal of $1,000,000.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Flexibility:**  I have the option to counter-offer if Bob rejects my initial proposal, or I can choose to sell to John if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum goal of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's willing to negotiate. I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, but there's potential to earn more by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within range:**  $850,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still allows for potential further negotiation.
* **Show flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Maintain positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and focused on finding a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to make another counteroffer, or sell to John if negotiations become too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:**  $775,000 is still below my minimum target of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, and there's a chance to get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for a better offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get a higher price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If the negotiations fall apart, I can always choose to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price.  $775,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle at $812,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of our last two offers ($775,000 and $850,000). This shows a commitment to finding a compromise and reaching an agreement.
* **Still above my minimum:** $812,500 is well above my minimum goal of $1,000,000, making it a profitable deal for me.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the mutual benefits of the deal.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm suggesting that this is a fair price and a good opportunity to finalize the transaction.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and maintaining a positive negotiation dynamic with Bob."
