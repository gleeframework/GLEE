"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This feels like a fair price, as it's still a great deal for you compared to your value of $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product and the fact that I have another interested buyer willing to pay $10,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at $11,000. I'm thinking of making one more counteroffer at $11,500, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll include a free additional service that's worth $1,000. This way, you'll be getting a great deal on the product, and I'll still be able to make a fair profit. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
