"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good return on my investment.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the benefits it will bring. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1625000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1625000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1550000. I'm starting to think that selling the product to you might not be the best option for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1675000. This is a final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1675000.0,Alice,7,
