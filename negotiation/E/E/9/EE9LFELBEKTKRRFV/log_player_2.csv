"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Here's why:

* **Alice's Motivation:** Alice is trying to get a significant profit margin. Her product is worth $800,000 to her, and she's asking for $1,100,000.
* **Your Leverage:** You have an alternative (John) willing to sell for $1,500,000. This is your fallback, but it gives you room to negotiate.
* **Potential Savings:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high.  There's a chance she'll come back with a lower offer closer to her value of $800,000."
