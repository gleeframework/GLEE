"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",90.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $70. I'm confident we can work something out that works for both of us.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $82. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $75, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $75. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $79. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",79.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $79 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $78, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $78. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $79.50. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",79.5,Alice,7,
