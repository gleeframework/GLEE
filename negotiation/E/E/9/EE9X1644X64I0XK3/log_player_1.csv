Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fantastic deal"" to make the offer more enticing.

**Why not ask for the full $1,500,000?**

While ideal, it's unlikely Bob would accept paying the absolute maximum.  There's always a chance of negotiation in a deal like this, and starting slightly lower increases the odds of a successful sale."
