Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting ""unique value and features,"" Alice aims to justify the high price, even though she knows Bob's perceived value is lower.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. If he flat-out rejects it, Alice knows she's better off going with John. However, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than John's offer. 

**Important Note:** Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate. If Bob rejects this initial offer, she should be ready to come down in price, but not below her $15,000 minimum."
