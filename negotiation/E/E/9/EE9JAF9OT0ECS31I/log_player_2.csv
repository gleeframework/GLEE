"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, it's worth a lot to someone like you. I'm thinking $11,000 would be a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price.  We'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

We're starting with a significant but reasonable counter-offer. This leaves room for further negotiation while still aiming for a price well below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't let it go for that low. It's a very valuable product. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a better deal. We'll reject and counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand this product is valuable, Alice, and I'm serious about buying it. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

We're nudging our offer up slightly to show willingness, but still holding firm at a price that saves us a significant amount."
