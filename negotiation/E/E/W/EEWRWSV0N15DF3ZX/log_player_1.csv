"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, at $11,000, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that's closer to my minimum of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe Bob might be willing to pay it, considering he offered $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is very close to my minimum of $10,000, and I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he might not come up any higher. Additionally, we're already halfway through the negotiation process, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
