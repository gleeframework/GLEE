"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's true value and leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's make this deal happen!",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet at $1,450,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize this quickly.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
