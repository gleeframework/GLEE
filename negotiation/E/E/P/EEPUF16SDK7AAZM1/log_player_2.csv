"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum price point of $100. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can get a better price by rejecting and counteroffering. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If the negotiation fails, you have a guaranteed alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting with a strong counteroffer:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Alice's value of $80. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  $85 is still below my maximum price of $100, giving us room to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's closer to my maximum price point, but I'm still looking to save more money.
* **There's room for negotiation.** We can try to reach a middle ground between my last offer and her current offer.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  If we can't reach a deal, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:** My previous offer was $85, and Alice's current offer is $92.5. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to come up in price.
* **Staying within my budget:** $90 is still within my maximum price point of $100.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to come down further. If she rejects it, I'll know I'm getting closer to the final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within my budget.**  $92 is still below my maximum price point of $100.
* **We're getting close to a deal.** This is a good compromise between my last counteroffer of $90 and her previous offer of $92.5.
* **Limited time and potential for failure:** We are approaching the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Continuing to reject offers could lead to a stalemate, or force me to buy from John at a higher price.

While I would prefer a lower price, accepting this offer is the best strategy at this point in the negotiation. It secures the product while staying within my budget and avoiding a potential stalemate."
