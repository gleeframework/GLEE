"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",825000.0,Alice,5,
