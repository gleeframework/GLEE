"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While the product is highly valuable, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,250,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and we can finally close the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
