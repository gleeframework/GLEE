"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $13,500 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $14,000, so I'll offer $13,750. Can you consider this price?",13750.0,Bob,4,
