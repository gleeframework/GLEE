Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for bargaining or for Bob to accept a price slightly above what he initially had in mind.
* **Finding a middle ground:** Offering the product at $135  is a compromise between your minimum price ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($120).  
* **Limited-time offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially accept your offer.

**Important:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you always have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
