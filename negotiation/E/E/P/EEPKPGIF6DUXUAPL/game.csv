"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $650,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  How about we meet in the middle and settle on $775,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value it brings to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and my own costs, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that it will be a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's get this deal done.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I understand the value, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $825,000?  That's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today at that price.",825000.0,Bob,6,
