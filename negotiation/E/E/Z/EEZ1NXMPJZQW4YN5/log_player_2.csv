"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. Would you like to purchase it for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, it's not a bad deal. However, you want to save as much money as possible.  By rejecting the offer, you create an opportunity for Alice to potentially lower the price to make the sale.  If Alice doesn't lower the price, you can still buy from John for the same price."
