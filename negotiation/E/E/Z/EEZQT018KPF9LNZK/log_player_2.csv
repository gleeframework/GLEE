{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it yourself."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's value while acknowledging your interest.

While Alice's offer is better than her initial price, it's still too high for my budget. I'm going to try and negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go to $1,150,000, which is a substantial increase from my last offer and hopefully a reasonable compromise. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to agree to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, reflecting a significant concession on my part and bringing us very close to your price point.
