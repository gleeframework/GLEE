# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs and expectations. This product is not just an item; it's a solution tailored to enhance your experience. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth $150. Would you like to make this investment in improving your [specific area, e.g., productivity, health, etc.]? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $150 for the product. Alice is offering the product at $150, which is your maximum price. However, you have another option: buying from John for $150. 

Since both options cost the same, there's no immediate benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate with Alice or explore other options before making a final decision."
