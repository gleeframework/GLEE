"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'm getting from it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product while still being fair to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This price should be more acceptable to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $950,000 is simply not enough for me to consider.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  If you're serious about buying the product, I'll accept $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm hoping you'll see the value it holds for you.  If you decline, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John.",980000.0,Bob,6,
