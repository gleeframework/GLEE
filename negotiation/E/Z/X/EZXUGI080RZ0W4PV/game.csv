"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I can only go as low as $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
