"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a fair price for the value it brings. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000,  given the significant value this product will bring to your business. This price still leaves room for us both to profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point, and I'm willing to compromise.  $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to accept $1,275,000.  This price acknowledges the value you'll get from the product while allowing me to achieve my desired outcome.  Let's make this happen.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
