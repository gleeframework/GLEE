"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters and hopefully helps me maximize my profit. I'm also aware of John's offer of $8,000 as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is a decent price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,750.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer. Hopefully, this will be enticing enough for him to accept, but still leaves room for some profit for me."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,250 is getting closer to my minimum, I think I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll counter in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. $9,000 is a good price and will allow me to still make a significant profit."
