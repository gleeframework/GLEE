"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. After considering the market value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price that I'm confident you won't find elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

While Alice's offer is below her own valuation, it's still higher than your maximum price and what John is offering. You can do better by rejecting this offer."
