"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is my absolute bottom line. Let's meet in the middle at $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,750? It's getting close to your bottom line, but I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buying the product if we can meet in the middle.",11750.0,Bob,4,
