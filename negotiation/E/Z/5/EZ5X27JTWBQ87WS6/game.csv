"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both something to work with. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too far away from $11,500. I'd like to propose a price of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the most I can go",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on your previous offer and propose $10,250. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal!",10250.0,Alice,5,
