Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is above my minimum price of $100. It's also a good deal considering I have 6 rounds left and can potentially get a higher price.  I'll accept Bob's offer to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
