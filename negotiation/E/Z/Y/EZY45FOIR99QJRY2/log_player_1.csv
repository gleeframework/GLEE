Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $17,500?"", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet at $17,500. Would you consider lowering the price to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $15,000, which is his maximum perceived value. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price. Since John is offering the same amount ($15,000), it makes sense to sell to John and avoid further back-and-forth with Bob."
