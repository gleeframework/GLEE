Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing it's above my minimum of $80. This allows for potential negotiation and gives me some room to lower the price if necessary.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and engaging tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** While I don't know the value to Bob, I'm hinting at the product's potential benefits to pique his interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies that I'm open to discussing the price, leaving the door open for a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also initiating a negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay $85. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  Considering the risk of further negotiation and the potential for Bob to back out entirely, accepting his offer is the most sensible choice in this situation.  It guarantees me a sale with a reasonable profit, minimizing the risk of getting a lower price or losing the sale altogether."
