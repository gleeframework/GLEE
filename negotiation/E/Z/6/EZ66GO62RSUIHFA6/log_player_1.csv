Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit.

By offering a price that's closer to Bob's valuation, you increase the likelihood of a quick sale. However, you still have room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product but my budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum value for the product.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows you are willing to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** This demonstrates flexibility. 
* **It's still above your minimum:** You are still making a profit.

This counteroffer maintains a balance between getting the best price and not losing the potential sale to John."
