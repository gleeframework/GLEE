"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,300,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe my initial valuation is closer to the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,225,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product, which I believe is a more reasonable price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to hold firm to get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  How about we meet halfway? I'll accept $1,150,000.  This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm holding firm at a price that is still profitable while also creating a sense of urgency with a ""final offer."" This might push Bob to accept, especially since it meets his previous counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1,150,000. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, which is the price I mentioned in my previous offer. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly anchored at $1,075,000 and unwilling to budge.  However, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer with several rounds left. It's time to show I'm serious about walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I feel we're at an impasse. I need to be compensated fairly for this product and its value. I'm willing to consider $1,125,000, but this is non-negotiable.  If you're unable to meet this price, I'll need to explore other options."", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm making it clear that I'm serious about my bottom line. Offering a small concession ($25,000) while stating it's non-negotiable creates a strong stance. This might be enough to push Bob closer to my desired outcome or it might be time to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, as I mentioned in my previous offer. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly unwilling to move from his $1,075,000 offer. It's unlikely he'll change his position in the remaining two rounds. Accepting his offer would be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,000,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the deal with John."
