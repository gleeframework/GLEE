Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. I believe this is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** You're offering the product for less than its worth to Bob, making it attractive to him.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It explains your offer and its rationale, giving Bob a good starting point for negotiation.

By offering this price, you're setting the stage for a potentially successful negotiation. You're leaving room for counteroffers, but also establishing your value for the product. If Bob rejects, you can analyze his counteroffer and decide if you want to continue negotiating with him or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below the $1,250,000 you initially proposed.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial proposal.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,225,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to compromise, but not completely cave. 
* **Is still above your minimum:** You're not settling for less than $1,200,000,  which shows Bob you're serious about your worth. 
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** This counteroffer gives Bob another chance to agree, but also gives you leverage to potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,180,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the value you placed on it initially. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,180,000 is getting increasingly closer to your minimum, but it's still below the $1,200,000 you initially proposed, and you're not sure if you can get him to go any higher.  Since John is offering $1,000,000, selling to John is a safe bet at this point. This avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential loss of revenue."
