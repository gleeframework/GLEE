"Alice, your offer is a good starting point. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This still leaves us both with a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
