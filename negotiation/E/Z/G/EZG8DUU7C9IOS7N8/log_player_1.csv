**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $1,800,000 twice now. This suggests it might be his ceiling.  While we could try to push for a little more, there's a risk he won't budge and we'll end up with John's offer of $1,500,000. Accepting $1,800,000 secures a good profit and avoids the risk of a lower outcome."
