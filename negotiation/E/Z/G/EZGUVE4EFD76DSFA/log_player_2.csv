"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $110 for it. This is a special offer considering its worth to you is $120. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $110**, which is less than your maximum price of $120. 
* **Buying from Alice saves you $10** compared to buying from John. 
* Although the product is worth $100 to Alice, this information is irrelevant to your decision. You are only concerned with your own value for the product and the offered price."
