"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm motivated to sell, but need to ensure a fair deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we aim for $12,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my expenses.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're trying to find a price that works.  While I'm committed to finding a solution, I need to be realistic about the product's worth. How about $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,500? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is fair.",13500.0,Bob,6,
