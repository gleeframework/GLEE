"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product offers is significant.  I could come down to $14,000.  This is my best offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer ($9,500) yields less than selling to John ($10,000).  It's time to move on."
