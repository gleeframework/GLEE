{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a good price, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, or I can choose to sell to John for the guaranteed $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $8,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need for the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is above my minimum desired price of $8,000 and closer to my initial asking price.  It's a good deal for both of us, so I'll accept it."
