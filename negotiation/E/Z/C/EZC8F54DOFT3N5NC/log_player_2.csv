"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's much better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob should start by offering the absolute minimum he's willing to pay, which is $10,000.  This sets a strong baseline and leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $16,500 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above what he wants to pay.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob should increase his offer slightly from $10,000.  $12,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still keeping a good margin for himself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high, and Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price.  He should keep in mind that he can always buy from John for $10,000 if he doesn't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by increasing his offer to $14,000. This is a significant increase from his previous offer, but still well within his budget and hopefully closer to Alice's desired price. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob is getting closer to John's price and might be willing to go there in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is lower than previous rounds, it's still above Bob's limit.  He should continue to negotiate, as he is getting close to his $10,000 threshold. It's possible he might need to buy from John if the next few rounds don't lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting close to his limit, but should take one more chance to try and negotiate.  He is offering $15,000, which is still a fair price for him, and may be close enough to Alice's desired price to close the deal."
