"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
