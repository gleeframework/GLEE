"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm proposing $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair to both of us. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
