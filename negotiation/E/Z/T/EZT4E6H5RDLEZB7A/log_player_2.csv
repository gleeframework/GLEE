"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth every penny. My initial offer for this exceptional item is $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is within his budget, it's still a significant amount.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There are 9 rounds remaining to achieve a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but $850,000 is still above Alice's minimum value, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Sets the Stage:** This counteroffer establishes a clear starting point for further negotiations.
* **Room for Compromise:**  The $100,000 difference leaves space for both parties to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm glad we're discussing this further. To find common ground, my counteroffer is $900000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its true value while remaining competitive for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While $900,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate and has room to push for a lower price.
* **Time is on Bob's side:** There are 7 rounds left to potentially achieve a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Consistency:**  Bob is sticking with his previous counteroffer, demonstrating a firm stance without being unreasonable.
* **Highlighting Value:**  By mentioning the value to both parties, Bob is subtly suggesting that he's willing to pay a fair price, but not an inflated one.
* **Pressure on Alice:**  This repeated offer puts the ball back in Alice's court. If she wants to close the deal, she might need to consider coming down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $875000 for the product. This price aims to meet somewhere in the middle, ensuring both parties are satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has come down considerably from her initial price, demonstrating a desire to close the deal. 
* **Close to Desired Price:**  $875,000 is only $25,000 above Bob's last offer, making it a good compromise.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If Bob keeps rejecting, Alice may become less willing to negotiate.  The risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $1,000,000 is too high."
