Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This is a strategic first offer:

* **Above Bob's value:** $11,500 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Below your minimum:** It's below your minimum value, but gives you a starting point to negotiate from.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get, making him more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob before resorting to selling to John. There's a good chance I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving towards the middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($10,500). It shows a willingness to compromise and makes the deal more appealing to Bob.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** The message emphasizes a fair price for both parties, which can help Bob feel more comfortable accepting.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum, but I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a good price and not risking losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, so how about $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,750 is still below my minimum value of $12,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already made a significant concession.  John is offering my desired price, so it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob. It's a guaranteed deal at my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing both deals."
