"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? I believe this would allow us to come to a fair agreement.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $98.  This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!",98.0,Alice,3,
