"Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity to sell you a valuable product. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you at a price of $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm excited to hear your thoughts.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is much too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider a price closer to $5,000. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $7,000? That feels like a fairer price to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is still a compromise from my original offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $7,500? If you're willing to make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're getting close to your comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can finalize the sale at this price.",8500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I know we're both getting close to our limits here. I'm willing to offer $8,000, my final price. This is a fair deal considering John is offering me the same product for the same price.  Let me know if this works for you.",8000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,9,
