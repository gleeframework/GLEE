{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, leaving room for potential compromise.  The message is friendly and positive, aiming to establish a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, selling to John guarantees a higher profit. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate a better price with Bob before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but unfortunately, $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500?  That way, we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10800. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,800 is closer to our minimum desired price of $12,000. While selling to John would guarantee a higher profit, it's worth accepting Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
