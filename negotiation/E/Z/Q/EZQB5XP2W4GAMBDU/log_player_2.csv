It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $75 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to start by offering a price that's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not going to pay full price."

$65 is still a little high, and I'm still confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm still leaving room for some negotiation, but I don't want to get too far away from my target price."

Alice has come down to $63, which is close to my ideal price. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's time to accept the offer and buy the product."
