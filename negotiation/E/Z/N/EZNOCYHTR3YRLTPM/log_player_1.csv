"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still being within a range that might be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before settling for this offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $900,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my initial offer. Hopefully, this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, as I'm still earning a good profit while getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I'd like to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him, considering the potential for a higher price. I'll reject the offer and try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $875,000. This is a compromise, halfway between Bob's last offer and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that this offer will be agreeable to Bob, as it is a good profit for me and a reasonable price for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I could technically keep negotiating, Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  There is a risk that if I keep rejecting his offer, he might get frustrated and walk away. Therefore, accepting his offer ensures a deal and a profit of $800,000. It's important to weigh the potential gains against the risks of further negotiation, especially with limited rounds remaining."
