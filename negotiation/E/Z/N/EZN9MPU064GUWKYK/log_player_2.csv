"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial. I'm confident that this product will be a significant asset to your business. Let's discuss the specifics and find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While Alice claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, her offer of $1,400,000 is still too close to your maximum price.
* **John's price is your fallback:** You're guaranteed to be able to purchase the product from John for $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** Rejecting Alice's offer gives you leverage to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or to secure a better deal with another seller. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you are not committing to buying from John immediately but are instead opening up the possibility of a better deal."
