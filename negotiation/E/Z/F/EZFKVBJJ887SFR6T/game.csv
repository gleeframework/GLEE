"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering the product's value to me. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value it can bring to your business.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's value to me. Let's work together to close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,315,000.
