"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Since Alice is offering the product at her minimum price, there's no room for negotiation.  Buying from John for the same price means you avoid the hassle of negotiation and the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffers."
