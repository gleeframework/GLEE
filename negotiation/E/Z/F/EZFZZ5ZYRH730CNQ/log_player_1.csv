Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your confidence in the product, your starting price is significantly higher than my budget. To get this deal moving, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my maximum, and it reflects the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you putting an offer on the table. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price was already taking your budget considerations into account. To find a middle ground, I propose we meet at $1,900,000. This reflects a considerable reduction on my end while acknowledging the product's worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still outside my comfortable price range. To show my continued interest, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
