"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your confidence in the product, your starting price is significantly higher than my budget. To get this deal moving, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my maximum, and it reflects the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you putting an offer on the table. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price was already taking your budget considerations into account. To find a middle ground, I propose we meet at $1,900,000. This reflects a considerable reduction on my end while acknowledging the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still outside my comfortable price range. To show my continued interest, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial price.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal considering the product's inherent value and potential.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
