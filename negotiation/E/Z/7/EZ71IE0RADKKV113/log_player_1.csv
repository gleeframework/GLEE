Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $14,000 right now.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $14,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest,  $14,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $16,500, reflecting the product's value and our ongoing discussion. Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm ready to buy it. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $15,500 is a good price, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds. It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing the sale and having to sell to John at a lower price."
