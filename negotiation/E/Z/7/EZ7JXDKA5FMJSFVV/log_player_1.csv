"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is interested in this offer before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush. Bob's offer is too low. I'll reject it and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm countering with $95. This is a compromise that's closer to my initial asking price but still gives Bob room to negotiate. I believe this is a fair offer that will encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is getting closer, it's still not where I want to be. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get Bob to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm countering with $90.  This is a further compromise, but it still leaves me a decent profit margin.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
