"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $8,000, so I won't go lower than that.
* **Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **First offer:**  Starting with a price of $9,500 is a strong opening. It's close to my minimum, but also leaves room for potential counteroffers and a good deal for both of us. 
* **Strategic advantage:**  By offering a high price first, I establish the upper limit of the negotiation and put the pressure on Bob to make the first counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I'm unwilling to sell the product for less than $8,000.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There are 8 rounds remaining, and I can use this time to try and negotiate a price closer to my desired $9,500.
* **John's offer:** While John is offering $8,000, I want to explore the possibility of getting closer to my target price with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  While my ideal price is $9,500, I'm willing to compromise slightly to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  A counteroffer of $9,000 keeps the pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired price.
* **Reasonable offer:**  It's a fair price considering Bob's value of $10,000 and my minimum of $8,000. 

**Strategy:**  By consistently counteroffering, I'm aiming to slowly push the price up while leaving room for potential concessions from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Pressure on Bob:** This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about getting a price close to my desired range.
* **Maintain momentum:** I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward while still holding out for a better price.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob is clearly getting closer to my minimum price, and I want to show him that I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Time is running out:** With only three rounds left, I need to be realistic about my potential gains.
* **John's offer:** While $8,800 is better than John's offer, I still want to try and push Bob a bit further.

**Strategy:** This is a calculated risk, but it could be the last chance to get a slightly higher price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in closing the deal and accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the chances of Bob increasing his offer significantly are slim.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  John is willing to pay $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  The negotiation has been going on for a while, and the potential gains from continuing are minimal.  

**Decision:** It's best to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John and avoid the risk of getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
