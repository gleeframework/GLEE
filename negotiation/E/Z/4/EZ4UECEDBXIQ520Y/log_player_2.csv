"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a price as close to his maximum value ($10,000) as possible. By offering $8,500, he's making a significant counteroffer, but one that still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This should hopefully encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $9,200 is closer to his desired price than $9,500, there's still some room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows that he is willing to negotiate, but still wants to get a good deal.  $8,800 is still significantly lower than Alice's offer, but is higher than his previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum price.  While Bob would prefer a lower price, it's likely that Alice won't go much lower, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is still within his budget and saves him $1,000 compared to buying from John."
