"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $9,500.  If you're willing to consider that, I'm ready to make a deal. ",9500.0,Bob,4,
