"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",7250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,125? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $7,125 is still a bit too low.  Let's try $7,187.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a final deal.",7187.5,Alice,7,
