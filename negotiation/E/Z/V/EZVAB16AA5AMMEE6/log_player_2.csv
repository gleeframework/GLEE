"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the benefits it provides, I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it at an exclusive price of $120. This offer is tailored to ensure you receive the best value while also allowing me to maximize the return on my investment. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and is already making a profit at $120. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get Alice to lower the price further."
