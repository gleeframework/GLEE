"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great deal for you on this amazing product! I'm willing to let you have it for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer of $140 is higher than both your maximum price ($100) and what John offers ($100). It makes the most sense to buy from John."
