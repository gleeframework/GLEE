"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value item. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice at $950,000 saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Although the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, that information is not relevant to your decision as your goal is to minimize your cost, not maximize Alice's profit."
