"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to negotiate if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, it's still higher than your maximum budget and significantly higher than her own valuation. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price or proceeding with your backup plan to buy from John for $12,000."
