Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $110. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105.  If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

While $105 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $105 isn't quite there yet. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $107.50. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
