Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I recommend:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 (Bob's value) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage.  Here's how to play it:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,100,000 sets a strong initial point and leaves room for negotiation (if needed) without going below your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on ""unique value"" to remind Bob of the product's benefits.
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can slightly reduce the price, but never go below $1,200,000.
* **Confidence:**  Project confidence in your offer.  You have a strong position with John as a backup buyer."
