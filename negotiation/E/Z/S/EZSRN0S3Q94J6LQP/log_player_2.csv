"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $150, so $130 is a good deal for him.
* **Saving Money:** While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and forcing him to buy from John for $150 is too high. 
* **Compromise:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise by moving from $140 to $130.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $130 is the best option for Bob in this situation."
