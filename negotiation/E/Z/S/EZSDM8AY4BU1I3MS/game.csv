"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my maximum budget for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a substantial concession on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal closed.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, your final offer is still quite a way off from what I consider a fair deal.  I'm willing to accept $1,020,000.  This offer takes into account your budget constraints while still reflecting the product's value.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,020,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be a better option.",980000.0,Bob,6,
