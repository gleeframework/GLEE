"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $87.50. Can you meet me at that price?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference - $88.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done.",88.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. However, $88.50 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to go up to $87. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you meet me at that price?",87.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $87 is a good offer, but I need to be a bit closer to $90 to make this work for me. How about $89? That's just a dollar more than your last offer and gives me a little more wiggle room. What do you say?",89.0,Alice,7,
