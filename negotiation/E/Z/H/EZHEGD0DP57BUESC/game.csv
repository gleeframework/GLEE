"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in this product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
