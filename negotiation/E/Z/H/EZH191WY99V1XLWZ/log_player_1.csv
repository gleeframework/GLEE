Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm eager to close the deal, I need to ensure I get a price closer to the product's true worth. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low at this stage.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still represents a great value for you and allows me to recoup a fair portion of the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my target price, I still believe the product is worth more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  I'm offering a final compromise at $825,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $795,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While Bob's offer of $795,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John for $800,000.  To avoid risking losing out on a better price, I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John. It's not the ideal outcome, but it guarantees me a reasonable amount and avoids any further negotiation risks."
