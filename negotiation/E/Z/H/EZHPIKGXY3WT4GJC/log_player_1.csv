"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also well above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This approach maximizes the potential profit while leaving room for a few rounds of negotiation to potentially reach an even better price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better price."

{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering with a price of $8,500. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and it's also halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a decent profit."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $8,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than what I consider the product to be worth. I will reject this offer and continue negotiating to try and reach a price that benefits us both."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a slightly lower price of $8,200. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and shows a willingness to compromise. It's also a small increase from Bob's last offer, which could encourage him to accept. Since we're nearing the middle of the rounds, it's important to reach a deal soon."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'm not satisfied with the negotiations so far, I don't want to risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price.  I'll accept John's offer of $8,000, which guarantees me my minimum profit."
