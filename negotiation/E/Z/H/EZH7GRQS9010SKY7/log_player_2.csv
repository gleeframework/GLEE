"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is better than John's offer of $1,500,000.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further with Alice, accepting her offer is the best immediate option to save money."
