Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point as it's  more than my minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter his offer, but I also have John as a backup buyer for $80 if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is higher than what John is offering.  It's also closer to my desired price point.  Accepting this offer is the best option at this time."
