Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's a $2,000 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential compromise.
* **It shows you're serious:** By offering a concrete price, you demonstrate that you're ready to negotiate.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below what you'd like to get. Rejecting his offer gives you the opportunity to counter and potentially secure a better price. You can use the information you have - that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob - to your advantage in the next round of negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

This counteroffer is a good strategy because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  You're meeting Bob halfway by splitting the difference between your previous offer and his counteroffer.
* **It shows flexibility:**  You're demonstrating that you're willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of you. 

By making this counteroffer, you show Bob that you're serious about selling the product to him while still maintaining your desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than what John would pay and is closer to your desired price. Accepting his offer ensures you get a good price while avoiding further negotiation."
