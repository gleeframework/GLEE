"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  Let me know if that works for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
