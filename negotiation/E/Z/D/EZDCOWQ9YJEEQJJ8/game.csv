"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it reflects the value this product holds for you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
