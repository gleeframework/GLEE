{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is very valuable to you. My initial price is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident the product is worth it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it reflects the value this product holds for you. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a slightly better price with further negotiation. It's too risky to sell to John at this point as I might be able to close the deal with Bob for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point. I'm willing to come down a little more to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it's my minimum acceptable price. I believe this product is worth this price to you, considering its potential value. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price again. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll give you $925,000, and that's my final offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is below my minimum.  While I could make a counteroffer and continue negotiations, I've already made multiple concessions. It's too risky to continue with Bob at this point, as I might not be able to get a better price. I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000."
