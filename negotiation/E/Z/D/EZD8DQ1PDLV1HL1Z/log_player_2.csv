"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum budget.** There's no immediate incentive to accept. 
* **You have no information about the product's value to Alice.** This means you can potentially negotiate a lower price. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to lower her price.**  

By rejecting the offer, you start the negotiation process and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While I'm interested, $15,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:** A $5,000 reduction is a significant amount but still shows interest in the product. 
* **Sets the stage for negotiation:** This counteroffer gives Alice a starting point for a back-and-forth exchange.
* **Avoids immediate purchase from John:**  This gives you a chance to potentially get a better deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,500. 
* **Meeting halfway demonstrates flexibility.** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and you've already achieved a $2,500 discount. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited.** You've already lowered the price significantly, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely.  

While it might be tempting to try for an even lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
