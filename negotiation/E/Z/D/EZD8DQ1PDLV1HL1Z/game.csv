"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
