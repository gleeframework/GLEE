Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **Leave Room:** Offering it at $150 leaves a $50 potential profit margin while still being within a reasonable range of Bob's perceived value. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's, it's too early to settle. There's still a chance to negotiate a price closer to your initial offer. By rejecting, you signal that you value the product higher and are open to finding a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price that reflects the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (But Not Too Much):**  Coming down to $125 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, making it more likely Bob will continue the discussion.
* **Maintain Profit:** This counteroffer still secures a $25 profit, which is a good outcome compared to settling for Bob's initial offer or going with John.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value again, you subtly remind Bob why a price higher than his initial offer is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Bob has steadily increased his offer, and $110 is a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether. He might walk away, leaving you with John's guaranteed $100 offer.
* **Solid Profit:** Accepting $110 secures a $10 profit, which is better than nothing and demonstrates successful negotiation."
