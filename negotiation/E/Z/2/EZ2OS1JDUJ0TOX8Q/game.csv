"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,400,000. This is my initial counteroffer. Can we meet in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price, however, the value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This reflects the true worth of what you're gaining.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000. Can we get closer to a deal?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
