"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming to negotiate a significantly lower price than Alice's opening offer.  A starting point of $1,050,000 leaves room for negotiation while still representing a substantial saving.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important for a positive negotiation. 
* **Clear Goal:** My counteroffer clearly states the price I'm willing to pay at this stage. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000. It's a great compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, she's still offering a price higher than John's. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate closer to John's price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,150,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This offer is a bit closer to my initial offer than splitting the difference between our last offers, signaling that I'm willing to move but also that I'm serious about a price closer to my target. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating that this is a ""significant move,"" I'm subtly introducing a bit of urgency without being overly aggressive. 
* **Still Room to Negotiate:**  This offer still leaves me some room to negotiate slightly upwards if Alice pushes back, but it keeps me comfortably below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000. It's the highest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has matched John's price. There's no longer any incentive to continue negotiating with Alice, as I can get the same price from John without further effort or risk of the deal falling through."
