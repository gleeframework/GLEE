Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $14,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, I want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to my valuation.
* **Slight Negotiation Room:** Offering it slightly below my minimum allows for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very eager.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""a steal"" and emphasizing fairness might encourage Bob to act quickly.

I'm balancing the risk of losing Bob with the potential to gain an extra $4,999."
