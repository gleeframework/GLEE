"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500

Bob should reject the offer. It's above his budget, and he can get the product for a better price elsewhere.  He should counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $17,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is fair given its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
