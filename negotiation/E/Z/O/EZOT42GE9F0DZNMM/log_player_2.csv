"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no incentive to negotiate further, as there's no chance of getting a lower price from Alice. Buying from John at the same price is the safest option, ensuring a guaranteed purchase without the risk of prolonged negotiations."
