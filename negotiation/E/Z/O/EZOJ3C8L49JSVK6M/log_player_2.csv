# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still willing to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and this offer is very close to your desired price point. While you could potentially try to squeeze out another $25,000, there's a good chance Alice will reject your counteroffer, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of a higher price with John."
