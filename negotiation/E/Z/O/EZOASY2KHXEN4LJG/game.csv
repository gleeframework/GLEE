"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiations. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,110,000? I believe this offer is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while meeting my budget.",1110000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, $1,110,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I don't lose too much value. I'm counteroffering at $1,180,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value and I'm hoping you'll find it acceptable.",1180000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle this right now at $1,140,000? This reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1140000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $1,140,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $1,160,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll find it acceptable.",1160000.0,Alice,7,
