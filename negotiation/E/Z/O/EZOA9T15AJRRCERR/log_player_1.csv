Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer positively, emphasizing the potential benefit for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while recognizing that I have a backup option with John. By starting at $12,000, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price.  However, if he rejects my offer, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to the value it has to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial value assessment, it's still significantly less than what I could get from John. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great value for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $10,500, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive and cooperative tone, highlighting the benefits for Bob while remaining firm on my desired price range.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise and framing it as a ""win-win"" scenario, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept the counteroffer.  This approach allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired range while still leaving some room for negotiation in future rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $9,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that is so far below my desired value.  Since John is willing to pay my full asking price, it makes more sense for me to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
