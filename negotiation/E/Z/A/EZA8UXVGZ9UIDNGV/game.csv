"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. I've already sold this product for $100 to John, and I'd rather not lose money on the deal. How about we meet at $105? It's the lowest I can go",105.0,Alice,5,
