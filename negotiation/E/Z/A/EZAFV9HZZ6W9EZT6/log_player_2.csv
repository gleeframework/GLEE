"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see great value in. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair deal considering its potential value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000). This means there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get a better price from Alice or negotiate with John to get a lower price."
