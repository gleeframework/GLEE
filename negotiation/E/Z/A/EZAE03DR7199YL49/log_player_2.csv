"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product, which I'm sure you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a product worth $15,000 to you at a discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is lower than the $15,000 you'd pay John. This means you save $2,500 by accepting Alice's offer.  Even though it's not the absolute lowest price, it's still a good deal for you."
