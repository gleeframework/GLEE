"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. It's likely Alice would be willing to go lower, and Bob can try to get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,800? It's a fair price, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While Bob was hoping for a lower price, $10,800 is still a good deal considering the product's value. Continuing to negotiate may result in a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal.  It's a good compromise, and Bob should accept the offer."
