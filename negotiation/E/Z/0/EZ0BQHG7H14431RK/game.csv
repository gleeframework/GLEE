"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,000?

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  That's a fair price, and it would allow us both to reach an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
