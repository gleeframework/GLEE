"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 at this time. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $100 is lower than I'm asking, but it's also below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $130, considering your interest. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $115. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $122.50. This is a good deal for both of us, and I think we can close the deal here.",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant about $122.50.  How about we meet in the middle at $118.75? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",118.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $118.75 is closer, it's still below my minimum. Let's try $120.50.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal here.",120.5,Alice,7,
