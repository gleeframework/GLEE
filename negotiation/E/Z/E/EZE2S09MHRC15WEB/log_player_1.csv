"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can do better than $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is my minimum price, and I believe it's still a reasonable offer considering the value of the product to me.  This allows Bob to know my bottom line while also demonstrating my seriousness about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not yet satisfied with his willingness to come up in price, so I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm dropping my offer slightly to $1,100,000.  While still above my minimum, it shows some flexibility and willingness to compromise.  It's a move to bridge the gap with Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit low.  He's demonstrating a willingness to come up in price, but I need to keep pushing for a better deal.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my minimum.  I still have time to negotiate before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my counteroffer, but only slightly to $1,050,000. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway and show him that I am serious about making a deal.  I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince him to finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a price that meets my minimum requirement.  Although I would prefer to get more than $1,200,000, it's better to sell to John and guarantee a decent profit than risk ending up with nothing."
