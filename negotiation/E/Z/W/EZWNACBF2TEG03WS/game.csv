"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this unique product.  However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Would you consider $850,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $875,000, and that's as low as I can go.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $862,500? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $862,500. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment, but I need to stay close to my target. I can do $875,000, but I'm not budging below that. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm ready to finalize this deal, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and offer $875,000.  This price is fair and allows us both to achieve our goals.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $875,000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to stay above $875,000. I can do $887,500, and that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can wrap up this deal.",887500.0,Alice,7,
