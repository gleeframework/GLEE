"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $9,500. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  That way we both walk away happy.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $8,000 is just too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a decent deal.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Alice,5,
