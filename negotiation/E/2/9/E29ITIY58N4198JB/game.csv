"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm happy to offer you $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also keeping me within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
