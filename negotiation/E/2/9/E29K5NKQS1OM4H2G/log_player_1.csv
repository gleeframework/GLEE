Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  
* **Justification:**  Phrasing like ""unique benefits"" and ""fair deal"" subtly anchor the value in Bob's mind. You're not just throwing out a number; you're suggesting a rationale.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can potentially meet in the middle while still exceeding your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There are many valid approaches to negotiation.  A more aggressive opener might be even higher, while a more cautious approach might start closer to $1,200,000.  The key is to find a balance between maximizing potential profit and not alienating Bob entirely."
