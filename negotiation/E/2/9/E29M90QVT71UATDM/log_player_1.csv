Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a starting point that is above Bob's valuation but significantly lower than my minimum desired price.  This strategy aims to:
    *  Encourage Bob to negotiate further, as he sees an opportunity to get a better price.
    *  Leave room for me to make concessions if necessary without falling below my minimum.
* **Message:** A friendly and encouraging message is used to foster a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I will counteroffer to try and push for a higher price.  There's still room to negotiate without risking losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to go down to $9,800. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can close this! "", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,800:** I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum. This approach aims to:
    * Signal to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
    *  Maintain a strong bargaining position, giving me room to potentially concede further if necessary.
* **Message:**  I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's interest while also highlighting the value proposition for him. This helps to keep the negotiation positive and constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $9,600? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,600 is just slightly below my minimum, but it's very close. At this point, it's more beneficial to accept his offer than risk another round of negotiation or selling to John for $12,000. I'm  prioritizing closing the deal and securing a profit."
