"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $10000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $8,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the lowest price possible. While $9,200 is less than buying from John, it's still more than Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $8,800. This would give you a good profit, and I'd be happy with the price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8800} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not sure $8800 is enough for me to consider it a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about it. How about $9000, which is the same price I initially offered? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is the same as her initial offer.**  This is a signal that she may be unwilling to go lower.
* **Time is running out.** Bob only has 5 rounds left, and each round is taking him closer to having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **The price is still good for Bob.**  While not ideal, it's still $1000 less than buying from John, and only $200 more than Bob's last counteroffer.

**It's a calculated risk.** There's a chance Alice might drop her price further, but the likelihood is low.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing out on a better price from John."
