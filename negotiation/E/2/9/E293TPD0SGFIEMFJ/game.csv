"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $8500?  I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. Let me know if that works for you.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $8800. This would give you a good profit, and I'd be happy with the price. What do you say?",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not sure $8800 is enough for me to consider it a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about it. How about $9000, which is the same price I initially offered? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
