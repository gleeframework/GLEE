{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $850,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you, and it gives you a good margin for profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, leaving room for potential negotiation. It also emphasizes the value to Bob, making the price seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to me and significantly lower than what I need to make a profit. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $800,000 for the product. This is still a good price for you considering its value, and it ensures I can make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
