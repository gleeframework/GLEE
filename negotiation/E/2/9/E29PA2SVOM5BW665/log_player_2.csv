(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $800,000 for the product. This is still a good price for you considering its value, and it ensures I can make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
