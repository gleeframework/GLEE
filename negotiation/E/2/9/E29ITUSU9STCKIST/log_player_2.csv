"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very reasonable price. I'm thinking $10,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
