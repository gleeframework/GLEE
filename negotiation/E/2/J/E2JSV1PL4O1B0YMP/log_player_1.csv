Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $20,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and features. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This offer represents a substantial compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 17000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $14,000 is a good deal at this point. It's significantly above his initial offer and a decent profit over my minimum. Holding out for a higher price from Bob risks losing him as a buyer, and while John offers my minimum, the negotiation process with Bob has shown a potential for a better outcome."
