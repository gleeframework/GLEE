"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for a bit closer to my budget. How about $10,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $10,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
