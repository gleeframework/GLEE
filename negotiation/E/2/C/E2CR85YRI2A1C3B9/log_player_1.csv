Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
