Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $13,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,250? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14250}
