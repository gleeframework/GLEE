"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great opportunity to purchase a valuable product for a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,000 is more than his maximum budget of $10,000. He can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or buy from John for $10,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. This is a reasonable price considering the value the product brings to the table.

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her initial price, it's still higher than his maximum budget of $10,000. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John for $10,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really only able to spend $10,000 on this product. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to buy right now. "", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Bob should choose to buy from John. Even though Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's clear that Alice isn't willing to go lower, so it's best for Bob to purchase from John and save himself some money."
