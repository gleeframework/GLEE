"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way too high ($1,200,000) compared to your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,000,000 is still above what I can afford right now.  I'm committed to making this deal happen, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000?  This feels like a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're committed to making this deal happen, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll counter with $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I've already made multiple counteroffers and Alice seems unwilling to budge further.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $800,000 and ensure I stay within my budget.  While I'd prefer to get the product from Alice, the risk of continued negotiation leading to a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
