"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,000,000 is still above what I can afford right now.  I'm committed to making this deal happen, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000?  This feels like a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're committed to making this deal happen, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll counter with $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
