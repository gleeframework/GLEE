"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $13,000 is closer, but still a touch high for me.  Could we settle on $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
