Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to me. Let me know if you're interested.

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget, but closer. You can reject and try another counteroffer, hoping to get a lower price."

I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to me.

Alice's offer is still too high for your budget. While it's getting closer to your acceptable range, it's still a risk to keep negotiating. At this point, it's better to go with the guaranteed price from John."
