"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $120. You can potentially negotiate a better deal with Alice, or simply buy from John for a guaranteed $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a slightly aggressive counteroffer, but still within a reasonable range. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to pay a fair price, but also that I'm not going to overpay. I'm leaving room for potential compromise in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm willing to push for a better price, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to come down further to avoid losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer at my maximum budget. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting the product at my desired price, but I'm also showing that I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't accept. It's a risky move, but if Alice wants to make a deal, she'll have to accept."
