(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 9 more rounds to make a deal before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum budget of $800,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also sets a firm boundary for my spending.  I'm hoping Alice sees the value in closing the deal quickly and accepts this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget.  While it's closer to my maximum, I have time to negotiate further and try to get a better price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise.  $900,000 is still a significant savings for Alice compared to her initial asking price and within my acceptable range.  This counteroffer also shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to go much higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but $1,050,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal.  We're both making concessions, which is a positive sign for the negotiation. I believe I can still push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is a significant discount for Alice compared to her initial offer and only $50,000 away from my ideal price.  This counteroffer signals I'm close to my limit, but still open to a deal. It also puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she's willing to accept a lower price or risk losing the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still $225,000 above my ideal price.  I'm not yet ready to give up on negotiating a lower price.  With only 3 rounds left, I need to be strategic.  I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, Alice will realize she's getting closer to my bottom line and might be more willing to compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final push to get closer to my desired price.  $975,000 is a significant compromise for Alice and only $25,000 away from my maximum budget.  This counteroffer shows I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm not willing to go any higher.  With only two rounds left, I'm putting the pressure on Alice to make a decision. If she rejects this offer, I'll likely move to buy from John to avoid further risk of losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still $200,000 above my maximum budget.  With only one round left, it's unlikely that I'll be able to negotiate a lower price.  I'm willing to accept John's offer of $800,000 to secure the product and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely.  It's a compromise, but it ensures I get the product within my budget."
