Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  It's a fair price that considers both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $950,000? This offer reflects my strong interest while respecting a reasonable price point.

I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000, as that's my minimum acceptable price. I believe we can reach a deal if we keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,025,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're clearly invested in finding a fair deal, and I appreciate that. To be completely transparent, my budget ceiling is $1,000,000. If you're willing to meet that, we have a deal. If not, I understand, and I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
