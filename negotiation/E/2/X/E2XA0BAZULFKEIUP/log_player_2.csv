I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business or personal life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750000.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'm intrigued by the product, but I'm not convinced it's worth the price Alice is asking. I've done some research and I'm not sure if it's as valuable as she claims. I'll reject her offer and see what John has to say.
