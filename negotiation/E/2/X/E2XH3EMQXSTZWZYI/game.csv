"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still allows for a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
