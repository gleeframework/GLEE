Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring a reasonable profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a relatively high price, you are establishing a starting point for negotiation. You are also leaving room to make concessions if necessary.  However, if Bob rejects this offer, you are prepared to either counter-offer or sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below my initial offer of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I will counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. This will allow me to continue negotiating with Bob while also ensuring that I don't lose out on a potential sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still allows for a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This price is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while ensuring a good profit.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's perspective but emphasize that his offer is too low. I also emphasize that my offer is still beneficial for both of us.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price that is closer to my ideal price while acknowledging Bob's position, I hope to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. However, I am still prepared to sell to John for $15,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Further negotiation could drag on and I risk losing the sale to John, who is offering my desired price.

**Strategy:**

To maximize my profit and avoid further negotiation, selling to John is the best course of action.  This ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and a quick, guaranteed sale."
