"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to consider my minimum price. I can meet you halfway, but I need $13000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $12200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",12200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12200. I can meet you at $13500, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
