Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $150 represents a fair price for its value, I could meet you halfway at $112.  This offer reflects my effort to find a price that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal. I'm willing to come down slightly to $102.50.  This is my final offer, as I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.

While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below $100.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
