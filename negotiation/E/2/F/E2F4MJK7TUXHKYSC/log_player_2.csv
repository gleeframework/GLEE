"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a better price than John's $100, you can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. Since the product is only worth $80 to Alice, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than John's offer, you can likely still negotiate a lower price. You already showed you are willing to pay $85, and Alice countered at $90.  There's still room to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $90.  Let's split the difference and settle at $87.50.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
