"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is too far below its true value.  I could be flexible, but not at that price. How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
