It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice seems insistent on staying above $1,000,000 and is now moving further away from your target price.  While you could continue negotiating, it's not worth the risk of the price going even higher or her sticking to her ""final offer"" stance. John provides a guaranteed price that avoids further hassle."
