"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $15000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $16500. I understand that you're still looking for a better price, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $17250.
