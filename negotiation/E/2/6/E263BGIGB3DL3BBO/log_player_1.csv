Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly downward. 
* **Avoid Greed:**  While asking for $14,999 might be tempting, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. This price point offers a good balance between profit and the likelihood of a successful sale. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, selling to John at $12,000 ensures a profit, even if it's not the maximum."
