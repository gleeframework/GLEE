Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good to anchor the negotiation higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and makes him feel like he's getting a deal if you lower the price later.
* **Justification:** Providing a vague reason like ""great value"" aims to pique his interest without revealing your bottom line.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $100 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's initial counter-offer being his maximum willingness to pay is unlikely. By rejecting and countering, we can try to push for a slightly higher price than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. I can come down a bit, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" we signal a willingness to negotiate and make him feel like he's also getting a concession.
* **Targeting Above Backup:**  Aiming for $110 still gives us a profit above selling to John, maintaining leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Clear & Concise:** This counteroffer is straightforward and leaves room for Bob to either accept or counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet at $110. Could we perhaps aim for $95? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is increasing his offer in smaller increments now ($5 vs. the previous $10). This suggests he's nearing his actual maximum price.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Further negotiation with Bob risks a stalemate. Accepting John's offer guarantees $100, which is better than the current offer of $95 and potentially only slightly better than Bob's final offer if we continue.
* **Certainty:** Selling to John provides a certain outcome, while further negotiation with Bob introduces uncertainty.

While we might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, the risk and potential gain are not significant enough to justify passing on a guaranteed $100 from John."
