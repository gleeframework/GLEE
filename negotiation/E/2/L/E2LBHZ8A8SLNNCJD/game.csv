"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  My budget for this acquisition is $1,500,000. Would you be willing to consider that offer?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,650,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $1,500,000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
