"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget. How about $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to go down to $8,900, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll be selling to someone else.",8900.0,Alice,5,
