Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $145. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay a higher price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $145 is slightly below your guaranteed price but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob the impression of a deal while still maximizing your potential earnings. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob could counter-offer, giving you a chance to potentially secure an even higher price. 
 
This approach aims to get the best possible outcome for you."
