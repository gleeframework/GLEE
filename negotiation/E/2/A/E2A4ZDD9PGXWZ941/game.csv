"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe we can find a more equitable solution. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
