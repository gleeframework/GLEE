"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we compromise at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $92.50? That way, we can both feel good about the deal.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $92.50 just yet. How about we try to find a sweet spot between $110 and $92.50? I'm willing to offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $97.50. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm really interested in making a deal.",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $97.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $102.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",102.5,Alice,7,
