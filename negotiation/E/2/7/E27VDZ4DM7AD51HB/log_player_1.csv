Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm willing to let it go for $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $75 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 82.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $80.50. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $80.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80 and it's better than selling to John for $80.  I'm happy to close the deal at this price."
