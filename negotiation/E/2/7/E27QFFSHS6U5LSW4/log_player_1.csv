"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $135, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my desired price and higher than John's offer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
