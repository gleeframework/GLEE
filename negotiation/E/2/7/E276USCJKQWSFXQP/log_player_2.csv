"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $15000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is already above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's getting closer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price and potentially save some money. He has 7 rounds left, so there's room to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500, and I think that's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the negotiation is getting tight, and there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further. It's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Alice. It's safer for Bob to purchase the product from John at $10,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
