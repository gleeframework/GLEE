Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $100. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
