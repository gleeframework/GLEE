"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $950,000 is too high. Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating or buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $950,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and still allows me to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than Bob's target of $800,000. Bob can still potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident this product is valuable, and I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $890,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $890,000 is closer to Bob's target, he can potentially get it for even less.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge further. If she doesn't, Bob can always buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to offer you $880,000. This is a fair price, and it's the closest I can get to my budget without going over. I believe this is a win-win for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 880000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really committed to making this deal happen, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $885,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation.  Alice's offer of $885,000 is getting close to Bob's budget limit. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might walk away, and then Bob would have to settle for buying from John for $800,000.

Given that:

* This is Alice's ""final concession"" -  further negotiation might be futile.
* Bob is already close to his budget limit.
* There's a risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a slightly higher price.

It makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer at this point. It's a reasonable price considering the circumstances, and it saves Bob some money compared to buying from John."
