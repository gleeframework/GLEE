Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000

``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $960,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This price still yields a considerable profit over my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and is closer to my initial offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging the negotiation further risks frustrating Bob and potentially losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate returns.

Accepting this offer represents a favorable outcome for both parties."
