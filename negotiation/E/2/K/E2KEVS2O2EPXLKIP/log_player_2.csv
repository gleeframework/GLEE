"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm asking for $1500000 for it.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be a worthwhile one. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. You're willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, so it makes more sense to reject her offer and buy from John."
