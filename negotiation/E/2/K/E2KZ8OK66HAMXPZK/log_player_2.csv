"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above my maximum budget. I will try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's to leave room for negotiation.  My goal is to pay as little as possible while still staying in a range that Alice might consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  This is a significant discount from my original price and still represents great value for you.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $7,500 is still higher than John's price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more, but I need to be mindful that going too low might make Alice unwilling to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm incrementally increasing my offer while still staying below John's price.  Proposing a middle ground might make Alice more receptive to the offer."
