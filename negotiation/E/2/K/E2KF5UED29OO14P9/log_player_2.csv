"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than you'd be willing to pay, and I'll still get a good price for it.  Let me know what you think!

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what you're willing to pay, and it would give me a more reasonable price.  Let's see if we can make this work!
