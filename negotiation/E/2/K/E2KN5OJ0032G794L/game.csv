"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to accept or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it still leaves you with a significant profit. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value of the product to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,175,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,175,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering I'm already paying more than what it's worth to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,100,000, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if that's the best price for me. Considering the value of the product to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. My revised offer is $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If this is still not acceptable, I may need to consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
