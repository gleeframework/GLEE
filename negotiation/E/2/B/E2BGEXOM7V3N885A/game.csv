"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $750,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
