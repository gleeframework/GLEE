"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.  Let's try to find common ground!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that price?",7200.0,Bob,4,
