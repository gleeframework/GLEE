Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a good price but I'm also prepared to negotiate, knowing that John will guarantee me at least $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take his offer and avoid further negotiation, I'm confident I can get a better price. I will counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm willing to lower my price slightly, but I still feel this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk further negotiations. I'm happy to accept $16,000 and avoid the potential of getting stuck with John's lower offer."
