Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and a desire to acquire it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I use language like ""Let me know your thoughts!"" to signal that I'm open to counteroffers and a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **Plan B:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, which gives me a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is closer, there's still room for negotiation. I can potentially get a higher price if I continue.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is still the most profitable option, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob before committing to that.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $980,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $980,000 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still within my acceptable range.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm not dropping to Bob's initial price but leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the product's value to ensure Bob understands the reasoning behind the price. 
* **Open to Compromise:** I use language like ""find a compromise"" to signal my willingness to continue negotiations.
* **John's Offer:** I keep John's offer in mind, knowing I can always switch to him if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $960,000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Gain:** Bob's latest offer of $960,000 is only $10,000 higher than his previous offer. This small increase doesn't justify further negotiation.
* **Significant Difference:** There's still a substantial gap between his offer and my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing negotiations could drag on and potentially lead to more counteroffers, wasting valuable time.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than any potential outcome with Bob.

**Conclusion:** It's more efficient and profitable to sell to John immediately, ensuring a secure and substantial gain."
