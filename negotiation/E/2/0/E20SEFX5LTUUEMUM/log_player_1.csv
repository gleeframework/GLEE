Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **Higher than Bob's valuation:**  $110 is higher than Bob's valuation of $100, but still leaves some room for potential negotiation.
* **Lower than your minimum:** It's below your minimum of $120, but if Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for $120.
* **Motivational message:** The message includes a positive spin, suggesting a good deal for Bob, to encourage him to accept."
