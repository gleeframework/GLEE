{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm a bit on a budget, and that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, so I can only go up to $112. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I can afford it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $112 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer to make a profit, I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum.  To ensure I get at least my desired value, I'll sell the product to John for $120."
