Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000, but am open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, I want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $10,000 creates a potential win-win:
    * Bob gets the product for $2,000 less than its worth to him.
    * I make a $2,000 profit over selling to John. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing me to potentially secure an even better deal."
