# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a slightly higher price.  Let me know your decision.
