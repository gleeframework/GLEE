Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $12,000 for me. However, I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for it, as that's my absolute maximum. I'm confident it's a fair price considering your own valuation. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
