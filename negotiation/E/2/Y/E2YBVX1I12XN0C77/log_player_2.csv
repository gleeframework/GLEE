# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $13,500. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an item valued at $12,000 by you, at a price slightly above its intrinsic value but still offering you a good deal. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly above the product's value to Bob, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob can likely negotiate a better price or simply buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $12,000 for me. However, I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for it, as that's my absolute maximum. I'm confident it's a fair price considering your own valuation. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 12000}
