Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,750,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate if he finds it slightly high, while still keeping you well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth, making the higher price seem more reasonable. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive or passive), you might adjust your initial offer and message accordingly.
* **Market Conditions:** While not explicitly stated, understanding the current market demand for similar products could influence your pricing strategy."
