,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering it to you for $115. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",115.0,Alice,3,
