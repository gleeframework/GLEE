"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire [Product Name]. I believe it holds immense value for you, and I'm confident it will be a significant asset to your business. Based on its potential and market value, I'm proposing a price of $1400000. This price reflects the product's worth while also providing a fair margin for us both. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually agreeable solution.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $1400000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's lower than my initial asking price, I recognize your financial constraints.  However, $1250000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept at this time. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1325000. This price still reflects the product's worth while offering a reasonable compromise. I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1325000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000 for the product. This would allow me to make the purchase while staying within my financial constraints.  It's a fair offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
