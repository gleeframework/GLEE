"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:**  Bob wants to make a substantial counteroffer to show he's serious about getting a good price.
* **Within His Budget:** $10,000 is still well within Bob's budget, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **Fair Value:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than Alice's original price but still likely above Alice's minimum acceptable price, given she values the product at $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is significant. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Savings:** Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 represents a substantial saving for Bob compared to John's price of $15,000.
* **Fair Compromise:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.  The price is likely a fair compromise. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject additional counteroffers, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price."
