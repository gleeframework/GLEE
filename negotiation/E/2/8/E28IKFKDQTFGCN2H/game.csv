"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
