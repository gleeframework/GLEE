"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below our $120 limit.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation environment. We clearly state our interest but also our price limit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $85, we aim to understand Alice's lowest acceptable price point better. Her response will give us valuable information for the next round of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Progress:** Alice is coming down from her initial price, which is a good sign.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $100 is better, it's still above our target price. There's likely room for further negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** We have the security of buying from John at $120, so we're not desperate to accept a price we're not happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $90?  That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, but in smaller increments. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Framing the Offer:** By saying ""$90 feels like a fair deal,"" we subtly anchor that price point in the negotiation, hoping to sway Alice's perception of a reasonable price. 
* **Time Consideration:** As we progress through rounds, it becomes more tempting to accept a reasonable offer rather than risk running out of rounds and having to default to John's higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Price:**  $95 is a good price, well below our $120 maximum and a significant savings from Alice's original offer.
* **Time Sensitivity:** We are now past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. While we might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice not budging further increases.  
* **Alice's Signals:** Her language suggests she's getting close to her limit. Pushing further might make her less willing to negotiate."
