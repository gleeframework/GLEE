Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,150,000 is more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still room to go higher if Bob is willing to pay more, but you're not giving away too much value upfront.
* **It acknowledges Bob's value:** The message acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob, making him feel valued. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you believe the product is worth. You've already established a higher starting point, and rejecting his offer allows you to maintain that leverage.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob. Since you want to maximize your profit, aim for a price between Bob's offer of $1,100,000 and your original offer of $1,150,000.  

For example, you could counter with $1,125,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,100,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to consider $1,125,000? I believe this price reflects the value of the product to you while still being within a reasonable range."", ""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Mid-point Compromise:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's offer of $1,100,000. It shows you're willing to compromise, but not at the expense of your profit. 
* **Emphasize Value:** The message reiterates the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that it's worth paying a bit more.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to move down if needed, but you're aiming for a price that's closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about getting closer to your initial asking price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,112,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,112,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,112,500 is very close to your target price.  
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If you continue to reject offers, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely, leaving you with the fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price, and it could consume valuable time and energy. 

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale that is close to your desired price and minimizes the risk of a lower sale price or losing the deal altogether."
