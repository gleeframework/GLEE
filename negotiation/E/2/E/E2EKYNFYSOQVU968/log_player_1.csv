I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for that amount just yet. I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price, as Bob clearly sees value in the product. I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between his offer and my initial offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price for myself."

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $1,200,000 offer.  While I could continue to counteroffer, I don't see a realistic path to a higher price.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I meet my minimum price and avoids further potential losses from a drawn-out negotiation."
