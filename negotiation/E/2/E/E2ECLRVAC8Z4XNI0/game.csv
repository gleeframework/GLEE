"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,200,000 is far below the value I've assessed.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the product's unique qualities and potential, while providing you with a significant opportunity.  Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? That's a fair offer that reflects both the product's worth and my willingness to invest.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,400,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,550,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part and a fair price that reflects the product's value and our ongoing discussions. Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your movement, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000. Would you consider $1,525,000?",1525000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  However, $1,525,000 is just a little too low for me. To show my willingness to find a compromise, I'm proposing $1,540,000. This is a small step towards meeting your needs, while still ensuring I receive a fair price for this unique product. Let's work towards a final agreement.",1540000.0,Alice,7,
