"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. Considering my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $800000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept for this product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price closer to $1200000 would be fair. This would still be a great deal for you and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1200000, but I'm still not quite there. My budget for this product is capped at $800000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1000000? I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
