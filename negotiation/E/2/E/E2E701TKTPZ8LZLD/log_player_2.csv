Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept for this product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price closer to $1200000 would be fair. This would still be a great deal for you and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
