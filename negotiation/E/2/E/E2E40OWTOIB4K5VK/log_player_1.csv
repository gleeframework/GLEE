Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking $900,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm framing the product as valuable to Bob, without revealing too much about what it actually is. This encourages him to consider its potential worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for his thoughts, rather than stating it as a firm price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** Great! I've achieved a good price.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll need to consider his counteroffer. If it's too low, I'll make a counteroffer of my own. If it's still too low or the negotiation drags on, I'll  consider selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $900000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  $750,000 is lower than my floor of $800,000. Accepting this offer would mean losing money on the product.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I can reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  He's shown interest in the product, and I believe I can get a better deal. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $800,000 is an option, I'd like to see if I can squeeze more out of Bob first.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer, likely somewhere between his $750,000 and my initial $900,000.  I'll need to consider how much room I'm willing to give."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $850,000 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous price and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""unique value"" of the product again, reminding Bob why it's worth a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and open tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've achieved a good price that's closer to my initial goal. 
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth continuing to negotiate or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850000 is closer, I'm still a bit higher than my target. I'm happy to offer $800000. This is a fair price that considers the value you've described, and allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  His offer of $800,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **No need for further negotiation:**  Accepting this offer allows me to sell the product for my minimum value without the risk of further negotiations potentially lowering the price.
* **Selling to John is the same:**  Selling to John would also yield $800,000.  However, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the potential delays and uncertainty associated with dealing with John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Complete the transaction:**  I will accept Bob's offer and move forward with completing the sale."
