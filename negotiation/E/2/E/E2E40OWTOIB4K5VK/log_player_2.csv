"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking $900000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is close to your maximum budget, but there's room for negotiation.  It's always worth exploring if you can get a better price. By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your seriousness in negotiating. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is flexible. If she rejects, you can adjust your offer based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's keep the conversation going. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $850,000 is still too high. There's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's more agreeable to both of us.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer allows us to continue exploring a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still a bit higher than my target. I'm happy to offer $800,000. This is a fair price that considers the value you've described, and allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further compromise from my previous offer, showing continued willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget. By offering $800,000, we are getting closer to Alice's price, and this could potentially be the final offer depending on her response."
