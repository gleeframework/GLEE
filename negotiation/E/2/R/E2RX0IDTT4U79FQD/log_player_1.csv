Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is consistently moving closer to our desired price range.  While $1,450,000 is tempting, we have room to push a bit further. John's offer serves as a good fallback, so there's less pressure to accept a lower price immediately."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, and we're now at $1,475,000.  While we could push for more, the difference is becoming smaller. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit over our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
