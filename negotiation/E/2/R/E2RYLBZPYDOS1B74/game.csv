"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product presents a unique opportunity, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested in discussing further if you're able to come down to $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price. To be frank,  $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the true value of this unique product.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to come up to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential value I see in the product.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us considering the long-term value this product offers.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate you working with me. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to make one last push at $1,450,000. If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
