"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment.  I'm initially offering it to you at $2,000,000. I'm confident in its value and open to discussing this further."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price acts as an anchor, potentially influencing Bob's counteroffers to be higher than if we started lower.
* **Confidence:**  The message portrays confidence in the product's value, which can be persuasive. 
* **Openness:** The willingness to discuss further signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product presents a unique opportunity, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested in discussing further if you're able to come down to $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). You have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. Selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000 but you might be able to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price. To be frank,  $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the true value of this unique product."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We're making a significant concession from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  Positioning the counteroffer as a ""meeting in the middle"" encourages Bob to view it as fair.
* **Value Emphasis:** We're reiterating the product's unique value, justifying the higher price point. 
* **No Ultimatums:** We avoid language like ""final offer"" to keep the negotiation open and less adversarial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to come up to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which is a positive sign. However, $1,350,000 is still significantly below your $1,500,000 safety net with John. You have some leverage to push further, but it's getting riskier as you have fewer rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us considering the long-term value this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  The decrease from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000 is smaller than the previous round, signaling we're reaching our limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Introducing ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept or make a more aggressive counter.
* **Balanced Justification:**  We're still highlighting the product's value but acknowledging fairness for both sides, which can be more compelling than solely focusing on our own position.
* **Risk Calculation:**  We're getting closer to the $1,500,000 guarantee with John, so it's getting riskier to continue pushing Bob too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate you working with me. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to make one last push at $1,450,000. If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate Risk:** Bob is signaling a potential impasse. While he hasn't completely walked away, his language suggests this is his final offer, and he's prepared to explore alternatives.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing the negotiation has a high risk of yielding only marginal gains. Even if Bob budges a bit, it's unlikely to be a significant jump from $1,450,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's standing offer of $1,500,000 provides a guaranteed profit and eliminates further negotiation uncertainty. 
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation with Bob delays the sale and potentially ties up resources that could be dedicated elsewhere.

**Conclusion:**  While there's a chance Bob might have gone slightly higher, the risk associated with continued negotiation outweighs the potential reward. Accepting John's offer ensures a solid profit and a clean break from what has become a difficult negotiation."
