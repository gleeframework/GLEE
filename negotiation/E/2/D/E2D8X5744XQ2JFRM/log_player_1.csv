Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 just isn't workable for me.  How about $10,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling. I think there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $10,200 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,350?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10350}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've been negotiating for a while now, and while I'm closer to my desired price, I'm not confident that I'll be able to reach a deal with Bob that's truly satisfactory.  John is offering a guaranteed price that meets my minimum, and it's not worth risking further negotiation at this point."
