"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $140, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the product's value and suggesting a fair price.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a deal. There's still potential to earn more than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum.  I'm also reminding Bob that my offer still gives him a good deal. Hopefully, he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $5 less than my previous counteroffer, and it's getting closer to my ideal price.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and the risk of losing the sale to John."
