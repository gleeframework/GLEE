Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to guide him closer to a figure that works for me. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."

Bob is sticking to his initial offer, which is too low.  I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if we can't reach a more reasonable price.  I'll hold firm on my price in the next round to see if he's willing to budge."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have a minimum price in mind, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be realistic about my budget.

Bob is not budging from his significantly lower offer. It's clear he's unwilling to meet my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and move on to John who's offering a price that reflects the product's true value."
