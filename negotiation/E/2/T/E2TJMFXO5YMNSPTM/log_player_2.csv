Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to go up a little bit, but $1,300,000 is still way too much.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if she's willing to come down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the value and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value and your budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm confident I can get a better price if I keep negotiating. I'll make another counteroffer, and if she rejects it, I'm going to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package, which will provide you with additional value beyond the product's price. I'm still offering the product to you for $1,250,000, and I believe it's a fair price considering the extras I'm including.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is still too high, and even with the extras, it's not worth the extra $250,000.  I'm going to buy from John.  It's a clean deal, and I know I'm getting the product for a fair price."
