Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $150 is more than your minimum of $120.
* **It's not too high:** You want to avoid scaring Bob off immediately. 
* **It sets the tone:**  You're confident in the product's value and not afraid to ask for a good price. 

We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'll reject it and counter-offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

Here's why I'm choosing to counter-offer at $130:

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:**  $130 is still above my minimum, so it's a good deal for me.
* **Opportunity:**  This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to reconsider without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to accept it and sell the product to him."
