"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000 to make this work.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $17000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $12000. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
