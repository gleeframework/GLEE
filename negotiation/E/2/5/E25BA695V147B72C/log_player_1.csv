Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

$8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll try to get a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
