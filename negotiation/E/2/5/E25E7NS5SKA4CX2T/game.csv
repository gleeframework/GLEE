"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase such a unique item. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $8000 for this product. Would it be possible for you to consider a price closer to this amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9500. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still unable to exceed my budget of $8000 for this product. I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum spending limit. Could we possibly agree on $8500?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $8500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $9200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I've done my best to stay within my limits. However, I'm unable to go above $8500 for this product. I believe we might need to look elsewhere for a better match in terms of price. I appreciate your time and effort.",8500.0,Bob,6,
