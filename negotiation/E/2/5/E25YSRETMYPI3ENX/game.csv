"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to do $88?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
