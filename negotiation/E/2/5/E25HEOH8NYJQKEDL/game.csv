"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,,
