"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident that this product will bring you significant value exceeding that amount. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This offer is a good compromise, and I'm confident that we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
