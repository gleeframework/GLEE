"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob. However, $8,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise again. I'll offer you the product for $9,200. This is the best I can do.",9200.0,Alice,5,
