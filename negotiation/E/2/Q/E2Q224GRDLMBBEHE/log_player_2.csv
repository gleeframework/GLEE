"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $100 by you. Considering its quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than just a fair exchange. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $125 for the product. This not only compensates me fairly for my investment but also allows you to enjoy the value you've assessed for it. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum valuation and what John is offering.  It makes no sense to accept a price that's worse for you than your alternative option."
