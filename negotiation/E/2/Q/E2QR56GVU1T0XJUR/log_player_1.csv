Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum value of $80.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  I'll sell to John for $80 to guarantee a profit and avoid potentially losing more time and money."
