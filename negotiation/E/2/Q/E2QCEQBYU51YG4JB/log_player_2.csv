"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. It's above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still allows for a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still outside of Bob's budget. It makes sense to try negotiating further before resorting to John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $900,000 is closer to what I need. However, to make this deal work for me, I'd need to come down to $925,000. This is a final offer from my side, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $925,000, it's still above Bob's budget. At this point, it's wiser for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000. Continuing negotiations might lead to further price reductions, but there's no guarantee Alice will meet Bob's budget.  It's time to secure the product and avoid the risk of further haggling."
