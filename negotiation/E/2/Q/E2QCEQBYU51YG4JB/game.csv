"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still allows for a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $900,000 is closer to what I need. However, to make this deal work for me, I'd need to come down to $925,000. This is a final offer from my side, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's finalize this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
