"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but not too high that Bob will immediately reject it.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation by asking ""What do you think?"". This implies I'm open to a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm aware that selling to John for $150 is always an option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $140? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate by reducing my price from the previous round.
* **Fair Price:** $140 is a reasonable compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I am unable to meet you halfway at $140. I would like to propose $130 as my maximum offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:** Even though Bob is getting closer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better offer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm aware that selling to John for $150 is always an option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $130.  I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm showing Bob I'm willing to be flexible by offering a price halfway between our last two offers. 
* **Final compromise:** I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaving room for potential compromise in the next round.
* **Staying positive:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal and am willing to go up to $132. I hope this helps move us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe we're close to a deal, but I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm aware that selling to John for $150 is always an option, but I'm still hopeful of getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're very close. How about $134?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 134}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm only increasing the price by a small amount, showing a willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my minimum.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed your last proposal and am willing to agree on $133 for the product. Thank you for your flexibility throughout this negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $133
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $133 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** With only 2 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a higher offer from Bob. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is better, I'm still making a profit with Bob's offer and avoiding any potential delays or complications with John."
