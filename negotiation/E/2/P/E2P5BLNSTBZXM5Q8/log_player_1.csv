Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition for Bob. It also leaves the door open for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to maximize my profits while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. By starting at a higher price, I can potentially earn more, but I also need to be willing to negotiate and consider Bob's counteroffers.  If the negotiation stalls, I have the option of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept an offer that's so far below my target.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range. I want to keep him engaged in the negotiation while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves room for a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Message:** The message remains friendly but firm. It reiterates my position while also emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground.  This counteroffer signals flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it also sets a lower limit for my acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you can't go as low as I initially proposed. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what it's truly worth to me.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob again.  I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum while still acknowledging his willingness to compromise.  My goal is to get as close to my desired price as possible without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still unable to go as low as $950,000.  How about we meet at $1,050,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. It's also closer to Bob's latest offer, suggesting a potential meeting point.
* **Message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's willingness to compromise while emphasizing that I'm still unable to accept his last offer. I propose a ""fair compromise"" to hopefully close the deal.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that is both acceptable to Bob and provides a reasonable profit for me.  This counteroffer is likely to be my final offer. If Bob rejects this, I'll consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
