# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our flagship product, which I believe will significantly benefit your business operations. Given its value to you, we are offering it at a special introductory price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to secure such a high-quality product at an advantageous cost. Please let us know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. You know the product is worth less to Alice, and you can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counteroffer process and see if you can secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: After careful consideration of your proposal, Bob, we have decided to adjust our offer slightly. We are willing to consider $1,290,000 as a fair price for the product. This amount still reflects the value of the product while providing a more favorable transaction for both parties. We hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the sale.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,290,000, which is just $20,000 higher than my last offer. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk is that Alice might hold firm or even increase her price again.  Considering John's price of $1,500,000, accepting this offer is the most beneficial option. It saves me a significant amount of money compared to John, and the price is within my acceptable range."
