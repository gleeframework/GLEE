"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the product's inherent worth, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
