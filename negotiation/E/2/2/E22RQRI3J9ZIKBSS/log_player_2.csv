The product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer of $127 is still a good deal for me, as the product is worth $150 to me. Accepting the offer allows me to get the product for a lower price than buying from John."
