``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $900000?  That's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my initial proposal.  How about $950,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
