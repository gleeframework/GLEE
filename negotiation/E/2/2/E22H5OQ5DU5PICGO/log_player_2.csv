"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's less than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $900,000?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my initial proposal.  How about $950000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise.  It's still below Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000 and is closer to his initial counteroffer of $900,000.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product while saving $250,000 compared to buying from John."
