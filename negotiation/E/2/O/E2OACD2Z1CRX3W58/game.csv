"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested in the product but at this price, it's a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm eager to work with you, $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $925,000?  It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.  Let me know your thoughts!",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.  Let's close this out!",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's find a number that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
