"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can do better.  You are willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice is motivated to sell for less than $1,200,000. A counteroffer is the next step."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm eager to work with you, $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $925,000?  It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. You are willing to pay up to $800,000, and while Alice has come down in price, she is still above your target. You can likely get her closer to your desired price with another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's find a number that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has come down to $900,000, which is closer to your target, you're still above your budget. You've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and it's likely that you can continue to negotiate with Alice. However, there is no guarantee that you will be able to get her down to your price. 

Given that you have a firm offer from John for $800,000, it's in your best interest to accept John's offer. This guarantees you the product at your desired price point without any further risk or negotiation."
