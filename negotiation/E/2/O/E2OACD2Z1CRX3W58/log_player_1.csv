Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the potential value of the product for Bob, making it more appealing.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for negotiation and ensuring I don't walk away with less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested in the product but at this price, it's a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial assessment, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There's room for negotiation. I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Not Risking Selling to John:**  Selling to John right now would guarantee $1,200,000, but I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations with Bob for a chance at a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm eager to work with you, $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $925,000?  It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** My counteroffer is a compromise that meets halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a price closer to my target. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth and reinforcing the justification for my price.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Increase my potential earnings:** By counteroffering, I'm potentially getting a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Maintain a respectful negotiation:**  The counteroffer shows I'm willing to work with Bob. 
* **Stay above my minimum:** My counteroffer is still well above my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out on too much."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.  Let's close this out!
