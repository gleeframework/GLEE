"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that amount.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $1600000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a new price of $1550000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
