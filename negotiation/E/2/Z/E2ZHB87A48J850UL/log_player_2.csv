"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 was a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. Since you can get the product for $800,000 from John, it makes more financial sense to buy it from him and avoid further negotiation."
