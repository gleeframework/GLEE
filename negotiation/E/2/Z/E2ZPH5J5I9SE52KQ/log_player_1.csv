Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $8,000. Would you consider reducing the price to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm aiming for a higher price.  Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum, and I think I can get closer to my target with another counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is still quite a bit below what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I believe that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm still holding out for a higher price. Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm confident I can get him to budge a bit more with another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer. I'm still not comfortable with $8,600. To be honest, I'm really only willing to go down to $8,700. Let's see if we can close this deal. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8700}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've been thinking about our previous discussions and I'd like to propose $8,650 as a compromise. This would allow me to stay within my budget while also providing you with a fair return for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,650 is very close to my minimum price.  It's a good compromise, and we're getting close to the end of our rounds.  I'd rather close the deal now and secure the sale than risk losing him and having to sell to John at my minimum."
