Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its current market value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While your last offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to land closer to my budget. Would you consider $750,000? This would be a great point for us to close the deal.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, he's moving too slowly. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000 within the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
