"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000.  This is a bold move, but it's important to set a high starting point to maximize potential profit. 

* **Why $1,500,000?**  This is a significant markup on my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate down. It also shows Bob that I believe the product is valuable and I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Why not go even higher?**  Too high a price could scare Bob off completely. I want to strike a balance between being ambitious and being realistic.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I will carefully consider Bob's response (acceptance, rejection, counter-offer) and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **John's Value:**  I'm always aware of John's offer of $1,000,000.  This serves as a safety net, but I'm aiming for much higher."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Why reject?**  My initial offer of $1,500,000 was a strong starting point, and Bob's counter-offer shows he's willing to negotiate. I don't want to give up too much ground too early.
* **Why not sell to John?**  $1,000,000 is my minimum value, but I'm confident I can do better with Bob. 
* **What's next?**  I will counter-offer Bob with a price that is lower than my original offer but still higher than Bob's current offer. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to compromise but also maintain my desired profit margin."

{""product_price"": 1,350,000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial $1,500,000 offer, but still higher than Bob's offer of $1,200,000. 

* **Why $1,350,000?** This price demonstrates flexibility while staying within my acceptable profit range. It shows Bob that I'm willing to meet halfway, but not give up too much.
* **Strategic Considerations:** 
    * **Bob's Potential Value:** By now, I have a better sense of what the product might be worth to Bob.  If he's really interested, this offer should be within his range.
    * **Time Pressure:**  I have fewer rounds left, so I need to strike a balance between being firm and finding a deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I will carefully consider Bob's next move, whether he accepts, rejects, or makes another counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, $1,150,000 still feels too low.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating.

* **Why reject?**  I'm not desperate to sell, and there are still a few rounds left. If I accept now, I'm leaving money on the table.
* **Why not sell to John?**  While John's offer is my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  I believe I can still secure a deal with Bob that is more beneficial.
* **What's next?** I'll make a counteroffer closer to Bob's latest offer, but still slightly higher, to keep the negotiation moving. I need to balance being firm with being flexible."

* **Why reject?** I only have two rounds left, but I'm still hopeful that I can get a slightly better deal with Bob.  I've already conceded quite a bit, and $1,050,000 feels like it's cutting into my desired profit too much.
* **Why not sell to John?**  Although John's offer is my safety net, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  With only two rounds remaining, I'm taking a calculated risk by continuing to negotiate.
* **What's next?** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still slightly higher.  This is my last chance to get a better price before I have to make a final decision."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,075,000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my last counteroffer, and I'm pushing for a price just above Bob's latest offer. 

* **Why $1,075,000?**  It's a small compromise from my previous offer, but it still gives me a slight profit beyond my minimum value.  I'm hoping that this small increase is enough to convince Bob to close the deal, as we're down to the final round.
* **Strategic Considerations:**
    * **Time Pressure:** This is the penultimate round, so I need to make a decision that's both profitable and realistic.
    * **Bob's Motivation:**  I believe Bob is seriously considering the product and may be willing to pay a bit more to secure the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I will carefully consider Bob's final response.  If he accepts, I've secured a decent profit. If he rejects, I'll have to decide between selling to John for $1,000,000 or ending the negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is now my only backup plan."

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round, and Bob's offer of $950,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I have no room to negotiate further.

* **Why sell to John?**  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't secure a higher price with Bob, John's offer guarantees me my minimum value. It's the most financially responsible choice, as any further negotiation with Bob risks losing the deal altogether and leaving me with nothing.
* **Why not reject Bob's offer?** Rejecting Bob's offer would mean ending the negotiation with no sale. This would leave me with no profit and no guarantee of a future sale.  
* **Final Thoughts:**  This negotiation was challenging, and I learned that starting with a bold initial offer is important, but it's also crucial to be flexible and willing to make concessions as the negotiation progresses.

**Result:**

* I sold the product to John for $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable value. 
* While I didn't reach my initial target price, I secured a profitable sale and avoided losing money."
