``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, while John wants $1,200,000.
* **You're still within your budget.**  The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to you, and Alice's offer is below that.

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
