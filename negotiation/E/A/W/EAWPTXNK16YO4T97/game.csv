"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my range.  I'm comfortable going up to $950,000.  Would you be open to considering that?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's value, and I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me here.",975000.0,Alice,5,
