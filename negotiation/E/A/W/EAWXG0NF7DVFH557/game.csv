"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a significant discount from the original price.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still quite interested but $950,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? That's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $825,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000 is a bit too high, but I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
