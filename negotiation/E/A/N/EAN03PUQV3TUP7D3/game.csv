"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. I believe it's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, however. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $10,500. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and split the difference. Would you be willing to consider $10,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you a little bit further, but $9,250 is still a bit too low. How about $10,000? That's my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us. If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to pay $9,750 for the product. It's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I hope you can consider my offer.",9750.0,Bob,6,
