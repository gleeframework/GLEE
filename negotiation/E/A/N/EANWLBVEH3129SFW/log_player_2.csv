{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to your maximum price, but you have room to negotiate and potentially save more money.  By rejecting, you can start the counter-offer process and see if you can get a better deal."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I can still push for a lower price. By rejecting, I continue the negotiation and can potentially get the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $125.  How about we split the difference and settle on $122.50? "", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad you're finding common ground. I think we can both agree on a fair price. My counteroffer is $124. This allows us to move forward without going too far beyond what either of us is comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $124. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $124
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $124 is very close to my last counteroffer of $122.50.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer and saving $26 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might save a couple more dollars, but the risk of Alice rejecting and potentially having to buy from John outweighs the potential savings."
