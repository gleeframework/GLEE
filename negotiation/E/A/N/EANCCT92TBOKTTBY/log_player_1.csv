Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit above the product's value to him.  I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum desired price of $100, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $100. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm willing to come down to $95. This is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price.  I'm hoping this will be acceptable to him and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate, especially with John offering a guaranteed $100. I'm going to sell to John."
