"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle on $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid  $10,800 is still a bit too far out of my budget. I'd be willing to go as high as $10,250.  That's a significant investment for me, and I think it's a fair offer considering the current market. If we can make this work, I'm ready to close the deal today.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $10,250. I can offer it to you for $10,525. This is my last offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",10525.0,Alice,7,
