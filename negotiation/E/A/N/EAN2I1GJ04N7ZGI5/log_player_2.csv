"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the asking price. This gives you room to negotiate and shows Alice you're serious about getting a better deal.
* **Target Price:** Aiming for $9,000 leaves room for further negotiation while still representing a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer and John's alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. We're getting closer to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle on $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9750}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's previous offer ($10,500) and our previous counteroffer ($9,000). It shows a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price. 
* **Creating Urgency:** We're getting closer to John's alternative price. By gradually increasing our offer, we're letting Alice know we're serious but also have other options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball now, but her ""final offer"" is likely a negotiating tactic.  Let's push back one more time before considering John's offer. Her price reduction from $11,000 to $10,800  indicates there might be a little more wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid  $10,800 is still a bit too far out of my budget. I'd be willing to go as high as $10,250.  That's a significant investment for me, and I think it's a fair offer considering the current market. If we can make this work, I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 10250}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer splits the difference again and keeps us below John's alternative.  
* **Adding a Touch of Urgency:** We express a desire to close the deal quickly, hinting that we might explore John's offer if we can't find an agreement soon.
* **Respecting the Deadline:** We're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. This offer attempts to strike a final balance before we have to seriously consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $10,250. I can offer it to you for $10,525. This is my last offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,525. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,525
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Savings from John:**  At this point, Alice's offer of $10,525 is only slightly higher than our target price.  The potential savings from buying from John ($1,475) are no longer worth the risk of continued negotiation. 
* **""Last Offer"" Tactic:**  Alice has again emphasized this is her ""last offer."" While it's possible she'd negotiate further, it's becoming increasingly risky to push back.  
* **Time Constraint:**  We're running out of rounds.  Continuing to negotiate significantly increases the chance we'll end up with no deal and be forced to buy from John anyway. 

**It's time to secure a good deal while we still can!**"
