Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go below $10,000. Since you have the option to buy from John at $10,000, there's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice. You maximize your savings by buying from John."
