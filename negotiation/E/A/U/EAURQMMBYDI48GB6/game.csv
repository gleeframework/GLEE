"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's something that could be truly valuable to your business.  I'm asking for $1,400,000. This price reflects the unique value proposition of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product could be valuable, but $1,400,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,250,000.  This reflects the true value of this product and gives you a significant saving compared to the initial price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $1,175,000? This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while staying within a reasonable budget.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,175,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,212,500. This offer is a significant compromise on my part and provides you with a substantial benefit.  Let's finalize this deal.",1212500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $1,200,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
