"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap. How about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to find a number we can both agree on.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects the true value you'll gain from this product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
