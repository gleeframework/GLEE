"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,250,000 is a tough pill to swallow, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for you. I'm confident that this price is still a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is close to my target price of $1,250,000. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John for $1,500,000 is too high. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a decent price without risking a much higher cost."
