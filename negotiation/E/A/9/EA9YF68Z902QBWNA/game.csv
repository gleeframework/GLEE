"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to buy this product but I'm only able to go as high as $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value the product brings to your business.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a little higher than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm confident this product will be a great investment, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're eager to finalize the deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $13,000. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
