"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident this represents a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a high initial offer ($2,300,000) establishes a strong position and leaves room for negotiation. This price is significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **Confident Language:** Phrases like ""exceptional product,"" ""unique value,"" and ""worthwhile investment"" emphasize the product's desirability.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording ""initially proposing"" signals your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to anchor the negotiation high and gradually lower the asking price while gauging Bob's interest and willingness to pay. By starting significantly above your target, you create the perception of greater potential value.  You have John as a safety net, so you can afford to be more assertive in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value, it's still substantially lower than your target price. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Maintain Negotiating Power:** Accepting too quickly might signal desperation and limit your ability to secure a higher price.
* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:**  His counteroffer suggests interest, but you need to determine how flexible he is willing to be. 

You have the security of John's offer, giving you leverage to push for a more favorable deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I recognize your position, my valuation for the product remains significantly higher. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this price point reflects the true value and potential this product offers."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** Acknowledging Bob's offer (""appreciate you coming back..."") helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Firm Stance:**  Reiterating your higher valuation (""remains significantly higher"") emphasizes the product's worth.
* **Strategic Concession:**  Lowering your price by $200,000 shows flexibility but keeps you well above both your minimum and Bob's offer. 

**Strategy:**

You're aiming for a balance between demonstrating willingness to negotiate and holding firm to a strong position. The goal is to gradually reduce the price gap while encouraging Bob to make more substantial counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value and potential of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards your desired outcome, but $1,950,000 is still significantly below your aspirational target.  While it's tempting to accept and secure a profit, you have room to negotiate.  

**Strategy:**

* Continue to negotiate, but be prepared to make smaller concessions to signal you're getting closer to your bottom line.
* Emphasize the product's unique value to justify a higher price point.
* Keep John's offer in mind as a potential fallback, but remain focused on securing the best possible deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I've given this some thought, and to find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $2,050,000. This is a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal through.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Compromise:** Recognizing Bob's willingness to move (""appreciate your willingness to compromise"") helps foster goodwill. 
* **Reduced Concession:** The smaller price drop ($100,000) signals that you're nearing your lower limit.
* **Shifting Focus:**  The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and potentially make a more significant move.

**Strategy:**

You are narrowing the price gap, but you're also signaling that you're not willing to go much lower. This round is about prompting a more decisive response from Bob to gauge how serious he is about closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and potential of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While still below your initial target, $1,900,000 represents a substantial profit and a reasonable compromise. Consider these points:

* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating genuine interest in the product. 
* **Time Investment:**  Six rounds have passed, and further negotiation might yield only minimal gains.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing might risk losing Bob altogether, potentially forcing you to settle for John's offer. 

Accepting at $1,900,000 secures a favorable outcome without jeopardizing the deal."
