"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, so I can only go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal too.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still above what I had in mind. Would you consider $75?  That's a fair price that's closer to my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $100, but that's as low as I can go.",100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $80?  That's the top end of my budget, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",80.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you at $90. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,7,
