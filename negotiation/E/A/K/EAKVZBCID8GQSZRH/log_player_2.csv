"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value, I believe it's worth $140 for you. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's value, but I'm looking to spend closer to $130.  Would you be willing to go down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $135 for the product. This is higher than your offer but still within a reasonable range given the product's value. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget.**  Bob is willing to spend up to $150, and Alice is offering the product for $135. 
* **It's a good deal for Bob.**  While Bob's ideal price was $130, this offer is only $5 more, and he can save $15 compared to buying from John.
* **Continuing negotiation is risky.** There's no guarantee that Alice will go lower, and each round risks running out of time before Bob can secure the product at a good price."
