Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal and you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's highly interested, but still ensures a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John at $120. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing potential profit from Bob while also ensuring a profitable sale regardless of his decision."
