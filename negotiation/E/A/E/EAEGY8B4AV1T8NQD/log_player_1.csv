Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $10000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8000?  That's the absolute maximum I can spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum price, I'll choose option 1.
