Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher profit:**  By offering a price higher than my minimum, I maximize the chance of earning more than $12,000.
* **Risk management:**  While there's a risk that Bob might reject the offer, I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John. 
* **Negotiation room:**  The price of $15,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters my offer. 

Let's see what Bob decides!"
