Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum.  I need to negotiate up.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Could you meet me halfway at $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
