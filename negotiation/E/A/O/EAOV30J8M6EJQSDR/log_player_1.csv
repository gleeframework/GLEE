Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're ensuring you get more than your minimum value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob still has room to counteroffer while still getting a good deal.
* **It sets the tone for a strong negotiation:** It shows you're confident in the product's value but willing to negotiate. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $1,050,000, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm dropping the price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm on getting a good price for my product.  This counteroffer reflects a willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a fair return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident we can reach a price that benefits both of us. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a compromise."

I'm going to drop the price just a bit more to show flexibility and encourage Bob to accept. This is still a reasonable price, and I'm getting closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has clearly reached his limit, and while I would prefer a higher price, it's not worth continuing to negotiate at this point.  I'm going to accept John's offer to avoid further delays and secure a sale."
