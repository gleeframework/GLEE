However, the value this product offers is truly unique, and $900,000 undervalues it significantly.  Could you consider $1,050,000?

Bob's offer:

While Bob is getting closer, the negotiations are progressing slowly and he's still significantly below my minimum price. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that justifies continuing to negotiate when I have a guaranteed offer for $1,200,000 from John."
