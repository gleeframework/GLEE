"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, my budget allows me to spend up to $500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my willingness to purchase. Looking forward to your response.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $500000. Considering its unique value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $900000. It's a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $900000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700000. This price reflects my valuation of the product and aligns more closely with my financial capabilities. I look forward to your consideration.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $800000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, though.
