,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",14500.0,Bob,4,
