"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, just below my minimum acceptable price.  This sets the tone for the negotiation and hopefully pushes Bob towards a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counteroffer in the next round.  There's still room for negotiation before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show a willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer should encourage Bob to come up with a better offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is a bit closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping we can find a middle ground before I consider selling to John. There are still rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm continuing to negotiate with Bob by meeting him halfway. This counteroffer should make him feel like we're getting closer to an agreement. If he rejects again, I might start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation.  It's clear that Bob isn't willing to meet my minimum acceptable price.  To ensure I get a reasonable price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
