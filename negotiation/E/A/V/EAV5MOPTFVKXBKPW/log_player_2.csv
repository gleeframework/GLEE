"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
