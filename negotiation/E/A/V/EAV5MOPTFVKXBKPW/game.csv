"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good middle ground. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
