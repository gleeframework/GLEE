While it's less than we hoped for, accepting Bob's offer at $1,680,000 makes the most sense at this stage.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's still a significant profit above our minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Bob seems anchored around $1,700,000, and we risk him walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows us to allocate resources elsewhere."
