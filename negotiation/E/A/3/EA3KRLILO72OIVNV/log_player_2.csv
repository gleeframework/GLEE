"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It leaves little room for negotiation and is close to your maximum budget (and John's offer).  It's in your best interest to counter-offer and try to bring the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks valuable, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is a starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility. It's a significant drop from her initial price but still above her perceived value of the product. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message aims to keep the negotiation amicable while clearly stating your price limit. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it. You can gradually increase your offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved towards your price, $12,250 is still a significant amount above her product valuation. There's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about we settle on $11,250? That seems like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer shows willingness to move closer to Alice's price while still aiming for a significant discount. 
* **Targeting the Midpoint:**  This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($10,500) and her current offer ($12,250).
* **Direct and Clear:** The message keeps the negotiation straightforward and focused on reaching a mutually agreeable price."
