"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $100. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer.",100.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $100 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to purchase the product for $85.  Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I'm willing to consider your offer of $85, but I need to ensure I get a fair return for the product. Would it be possible for us to meet somewhere in the middle? How about $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my budget at $90.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. How about we set the price at $89? It's slightly above your last offer, but still within my acceptable range. I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",89.0,Alice,5,
