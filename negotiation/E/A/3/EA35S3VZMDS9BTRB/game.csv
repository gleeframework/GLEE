"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,100,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly lower than the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
