"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're getting closer to a price point, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much profit. Let's try to find a compromise.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
