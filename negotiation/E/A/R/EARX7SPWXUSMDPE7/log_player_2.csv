"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, leaving little room for negotiation. It's in our best interest to counter-offer and see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $15,000 maximum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $10,500 puts us slightly above the middle ground between Alice's valuation ($10,000) and her initial offer ($14,000). This signals that we're serious but also looking for a fair deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting lower, we allow ourselves space to potentially meet Alice somewhere in the middle if she counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob.  While that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, I could be willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice met us halfway from the initial offer, we still have room to negotiate.  A counteroffer closer to $11,000 could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome before we consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,250? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  We're splitting the difference between her last offer ($12,250) and our previous counteroffer ($10,500), signaling a willingness to compromise but holding firm on a lower price.
* **Urgency:**  Framing it as a ""fair compromise"" subtly adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Alice to accept before we potentially walk away.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer still keeps us well below our maximum budget and leaves room for a final minor concession if needed."
