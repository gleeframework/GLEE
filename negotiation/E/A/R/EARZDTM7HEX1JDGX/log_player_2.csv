"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $22,000  to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to establish your position early on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $10,000 to consider it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** Starting with a much lower counteroffer ($10,000) signals that Alice's initial price is unrealistic for you.
* **Leaving Room:** While closer to your limit, $10,000 still leaves space for negotiation and potential compromises.
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and interested tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $22,000 is my initial offer, but I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This product is truly top-of-the-line and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice moved down, $18,000 is significantly above your $8,000 limit. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Her willingness to reduce the price suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **John as Backup:** You still have the security of buying from John at $8,000 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't reach a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? I think that's a fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continued Negotiation:** You're showing Alice you're serious about negotiating but not willing to budge too quickly towards her price.
* **Strategic Increment:**  The $12,000 counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and her current one, encouraging her to meet you closer to the middle ground.
* **Clear Communication:** You're directly stating your price limit isn't flexible, giving Alice a clear target to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a fair price for this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $15,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic to try and pressure you into accepting. It's rarely a true final offer.
* **Still Above Limit:**  $15,000 is still significantly above your $8,000 target and even your $12,000 counteroffer. 
* **John as Leverage:** You have the safety net of John's offer, allowing you to walk away if Alice won't budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but $15,000 is just too high for me.  My absolute limit is $13,000.  I believe that's a very fair offer considering the market value for similar items.  Let me know if you're willing to work with that."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You're reiterating your budget limit while making it clear this is your final offer. 
* **Market Value:** Introducing the concept of ""market value"" gently challenges her price without being confrontational.
* **Shifting Pressure:**  By making it your ""absolute limit,"" you're subtly shifting the pressure back onto Alice to either accept or risk losing the sale."
