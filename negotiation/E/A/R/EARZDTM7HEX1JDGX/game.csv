"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $10,000 to consider it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $22,000 is my initial offer, but I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This product is truly top-of-the-line and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you say?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? I think that's a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a fair price for this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $15,000? That's my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but $15,000 is just too high for me.  My absolute limit is $13,000.  I believe that's a very fair offer considering the market value for similar items.  Let me know if you're willing to work with that.",13000.0,Bob,6,
