"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the value to me, but $12,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $10,250 for the product.  This would give you a good profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $10,750. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe the product's value to you is worth it.
