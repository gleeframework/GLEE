"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to invest at a slightly lower price point. How about $1,250,000? This would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my budget and potentially giving us both a successful outcome.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $1,275,000? This is a fair price that I think we can both be comfortable with.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I'm still a bit above my ideal price point. Would you consider a price of $1,225,000? This would ensure a mutually beneficial agreement, and we can both move forward with this exciting product.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,225,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about we meet at $1,240,000? This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1240000.0,Alice,5,
