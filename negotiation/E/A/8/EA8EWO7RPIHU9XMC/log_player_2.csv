"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $130.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Your Limit:** You're willing to pay up to $150.
* **Alice's Offer:** $130
* **John's Offer:** $150

While Alice's offer is below your limit, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. You can then try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, knowing that you have John's offer as a fallback option."
