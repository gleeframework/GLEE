"That's a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can meet you halfway at $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750? I'm eager to make this deal work.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,750. I can do $10,250, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
