"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I can offer you a compromise at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $8,500 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go below $8,000. I can offer you a slight discount at $8,200. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",8200.0,Alice,5,
