Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is only slightly better than her initial offer. Bob is still determined to get a better price. While there's a risk Alice might walk away entirely, rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and could lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product. Offering $800,000 is a compromise, but it still represents a significant savings compared to Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to meet halfway while still pursuing a deal that benefits him."
