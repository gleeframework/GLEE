Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible, while still exceeding our minimum selling price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.  
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John for $150. 

By offering the product at $140, we increase the chances of Bob accepting and maximize our potential profit."
