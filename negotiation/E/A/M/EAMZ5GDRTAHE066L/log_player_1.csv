Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is higher than Bob's $80 valuation, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $100 is still higher than your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not an outrageous price, making Bob more likely to consider the offer and potentially counter. 

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to your ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $80. Would it be possible for you to lower the price a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's too early to accept Bob's offer.  While $80 is better than nothing, you can likely do better.  By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer and see if he's willing to meet you halfway. If he's not, you can always fall back to selling to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $80. Could you consider lowering the price further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut your losses.  Bob has made it clear he's not willing to budge much from his $80 offer.  While you can continue to counter-offer, the chances of him coming up to a price you're comfortable with are slim. 

Selling to John for $120 guarantees you a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
