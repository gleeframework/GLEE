"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or stick with your backup plan (John)."
