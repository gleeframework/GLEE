"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $115? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $115 is a better price than $150, Bob is still aiming for a lower price. It's worth trying to push for a bit more of a discount before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $115 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  How about $110?  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we keep working together."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $112? It's a small adjustment, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting close to his target price.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or he'll end up buying from John at a higher price. $112 is a reasonable compromise and a good deal compared to John's offer."
