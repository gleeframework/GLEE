"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $115? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $115 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  How about $110?  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we keep working together.",110.0,Bob,4,
