"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and it's still worth it for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good compromise between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but also leaves me room to drop the price a bit if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a deal at that price, but I need to make sure it's a good value for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer, but I need to make sure it's closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $90.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is getting closer to my minimum and it's only round 4.  I'm starting to feel the pressure to make a deal, but I'm also aware that I have another buyer waiting in the wings for $120.   I'm going to take the deal.  It's not ideal, but it's better than my minimum and I can move on to other things."
