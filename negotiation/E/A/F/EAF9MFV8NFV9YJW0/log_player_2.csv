"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $999,000 is a very good price, but there's still room to negotiate and potentially get an even better deal.  
* We have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if Alice is willing to go lower. 
* We don't know Alice's true value of the product, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering gives us more information and leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that is about 20% lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right.
* By offering $800,000, I'm leaving room for further negotiation, but also testing the waters to see how far Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $920,000 is a good price, it's still higher than my desired price point. 
* Alice has shown some flexibility by lowering her offer from $999,000 to $920,000. 
* I'm still hoping for a better price and believe there's room for negotiation. 
*  There are still 7 rounds left, giving me ample time to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.
* My previous counteroffer of $800,000 was rejected, but it was still close enough to her initial offer to signal that I'm serious about buying. 
*  I'm raising my counteroffer to $850,000, which is a compromise between her offer of $920,000 and my previous offer. 
* This shows flexibility while still maintaining pressure to get a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down significantly in price, and $880,000 is a very good deal considering our starting point.
* It's getting closer to my target price range, and there is no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds.
* It's important to remember that while I want the best price, it's also important to close the deal. Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away entirely."
