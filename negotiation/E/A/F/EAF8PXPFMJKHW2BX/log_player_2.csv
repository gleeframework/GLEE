"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. After careful consideration, I propose a price of $1,350,000 for the product. This price reflects its high value and the exceptional benefits it offers. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  He should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the mutual benefits of this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, I must maintain the value of my product. I would like to counteroffer at $1,300,000. This price still allows us to achieve a balance between the value of the product and our respective interests. I hope this proposal works for you, and I look forward to your feedback.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, it's risky.  He's already been rejected once, and further negotiation could lead to even more rounds, potentially costing him time and ultimately still exceeding his budget. Buying from John guarantees the product at his maximum price point, eliminating risk and potential delays."
