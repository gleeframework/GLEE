"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the mutual benefits of this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, I must maintain the value of my product. I would like to counteroffer at $1,300,000. This price still allows us to achieve a balance between the value of the product and our respective interests. I hope this proposal works for you, and I look forward to your feedback.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
