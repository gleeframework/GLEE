"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a fair price. My asking price is $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for less than $11,500 from Alice or for $12,000 from John. It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $10,500 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $11,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still potentially get a better deal from Alice, and if not, he can buy from John for $12,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if they can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $10,750.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  $10,750 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $10,900.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He has already gotten the price down significantly, and if he rejects this offer, he risks Alice withdrawing from the negotiation altogether. While John is a fallback option, Alice is offering a price closer to Bob's target and potentially still has some wiggle room.  It's better to lock in this deal before losing it entirely."
