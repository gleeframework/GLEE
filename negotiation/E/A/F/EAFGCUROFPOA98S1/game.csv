"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this deal happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a good middle ground that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to find common ground here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
