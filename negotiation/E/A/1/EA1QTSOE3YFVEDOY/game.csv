"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $800000?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $815000. This is a reasonable compromise that I believe will be beneficial for both of us. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
