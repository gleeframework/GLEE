"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. Given its value to you, I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. He has room to negotiate down to at least $13,000 (and potentially even lower) before reaching his maximum price of $15,000.  

By rejecting, Bob can see if Alice is willing to budge closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500 for the product? This respects your budget while still providing a reasonable profit for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a good price for Bob considering his maximum budget is $15,000.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice walking away and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential gains of a few hundred dollars."
