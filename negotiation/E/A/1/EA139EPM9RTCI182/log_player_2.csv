"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and bring significant value to your organization. As we've discussed, I'm looking to sell it to you for a price that I think is very competitive, considering its worth to you. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. After reconsidering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being more competitive than my initial offer. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you've proposed. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is already a significant savings compared to John's offer.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
