"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I aim for the highest price, I'm mindful of John's standing offer of $1,500,000. This knowledge gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably. 
* **Open Communication:**  The message aims to establish a collaborative tone, inviting Bob to share his perspective and begin the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is better than John's $1,500,000 offer. However, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I believe the product is worth more and am willing to negotiate further. I'm confident I can get Bob closer to at least $1,700,000 within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the market value.  However, the product's unique features and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This offer reflects the true value of what the product offers."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial concession from my initial offer ($150,000), demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** By highlighting ""unique features and potential,"" I reinforce the product's value beyond standard market comparisons.
* **Holding Ground:** While moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still aiming high ($1,850,000), significantly above John's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a collaborative and understanding tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is a strong deal for several reasons:

* **Significantly Above John's Offer:** It's $200,000 more than John's guaranteed offer, representing a substantial profit.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's willingness to meet in the middle demonstrates his serious interest and suggests this is likely his best offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Prolonged negotiations can be counterproductive. Accepting a good offer now avoids potential stalemates or Bob lowering his bid further. 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and settling for John's lower offer isn't worthwhile at this point."
