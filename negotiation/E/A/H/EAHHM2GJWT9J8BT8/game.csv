"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the market value.  However, the product's unique features and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This offer reflects the true value of what the product offers.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
