"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know its worth $10,000 to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the sale. If not, I'll be selling it to John for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice is bluffing. She wouldn't sell the product to John for less than what she's offering it to you for. By rejecting her offer, you force her to negotiate a better price or risk losing out on the sale entirely."
