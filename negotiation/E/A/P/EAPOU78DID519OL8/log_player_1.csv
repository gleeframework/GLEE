Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** You need to make at least $150, so offering it for less makes no sense as John will buy it at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Creating Value:**  To entice Bob, you need to offer a price that's beneficial for him.  A price slightly above his valuation, but significantly below your minimum, creates a win-win situation. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $135 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. You can always go down a little, but never below $150."
