This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but below your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving you a decent profit.  It's important to remember that you have a backup buyer in John, which gives you leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still not enough. You have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, so rejecting Bob's offer is the best move at this point. You can counteroffer and try to get closer to your desired price."
