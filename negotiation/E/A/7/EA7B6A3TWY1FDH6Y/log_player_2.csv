"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $120 is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider something closer to $60?"",

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start low but not insultingly so."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm happy with.  Let's see if we can negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us, I think."",

We're getting closer.  This counter offer splits the difference between her last offer and my previous one. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. I can offer you the product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $100.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to that price. I'm better off taking the guaranteed deal from John at $80."
