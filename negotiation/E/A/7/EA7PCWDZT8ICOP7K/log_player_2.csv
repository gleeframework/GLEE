Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer, aiming to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $10,000 is a substantial discount and could indicate if Alice is motivated to sell."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While $13,000 is closer to my maximum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal.  $11,000 is a good middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's latest one."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $12,500 is a reasonable price that is closer to my goal. I can save $2,500 compared to buying from John.  It's not the absolute best price, but it's a good balance between saving money and getting the product."
