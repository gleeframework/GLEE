"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we agree on a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,500? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. While $10,800 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $10,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value.",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget. To be honest, anything over $10,000 is going to be difficult. Would you consider $9,800? I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",9800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,800. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000, but only if you're willing to throw in some additional value, such as a warranty or maintenance package. This would be a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",10000.0,Alice,9,
