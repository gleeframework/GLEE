"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  This product is worth significantly more to you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects both our interests.  Let's close the deal now.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is simply not enough. We've been going back and forth for several rounds now, and I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. If you don't accept, I'm going to have to look at other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
