"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $140. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but could only do $110."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite & Engaged:**  Maintains a positive tone and expresses continued interest.
* **Anchoring:**  Starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's opening, aiming to pull the final price down.
* **Strategic:** The offer is slightly above Alice's perceived value ($120), leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer the product for $125. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $125 is still above our target price. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. $125 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $115. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Acknowledgment:** We acknowledge Alice's effort to negotiate.
* **Firm but Fair:** We hold our ground near our previous offer while signaling a slight willingness to move.
* **Target Focus:** We reiterate our target price range to guide Alice's next offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see, Bob. Let's try $120. That's my final offer. I hope you'll find it acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal! Alice has come down to her perceived value of the product.  While we might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, it's not worth the risk of her walking away or running out of rounds.  Accepting at $120 secures us a good price."
