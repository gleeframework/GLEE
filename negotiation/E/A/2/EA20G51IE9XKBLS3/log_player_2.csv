# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me. What do you think?
