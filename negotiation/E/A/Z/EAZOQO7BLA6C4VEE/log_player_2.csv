"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to acquire this item. We are offering it to you at a special price of $13500. This is a unique opportunity to secure an excellent value, given its true worth of $12000 to you. Let's discuss how we can proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,500 is less than Alice's perceived value of $15,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, my budget for this type of purchase is $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? It's a fair deal for both of us and allows us to close the deal efficiently."", ""product_price"": 12000}
