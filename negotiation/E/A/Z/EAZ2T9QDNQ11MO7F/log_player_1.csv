Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm asking for $1,100,000.  Let me know your decision soon as there is another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($800,000) as possible while still aiming higher since we have John as a backup. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $1,100,000 creates a sense of urgency (another interested party) and positions the price as negotiable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price that's still very profitable for you (Alice) while being more appealing to him than losing the deal."
