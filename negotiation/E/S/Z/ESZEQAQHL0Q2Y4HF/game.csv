"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more in line with my budget.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true market value. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,450,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? ",1100000.0,Bob,4,
