"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the enthusiasm about this product, but I'm going to need to come in lower than $1,100,000 to make this work. I'm happy to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price given the value it has to me and the fact that I'm willing to make a deal today.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the value it will bring to you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really close to making a decision here, but I can only go up to $1,060,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to me.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,060,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,090,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
