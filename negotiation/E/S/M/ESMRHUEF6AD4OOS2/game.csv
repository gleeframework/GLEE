"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be very valuable. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but I need to get at least $17000 for this.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14000.  It's a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",14000.0,Bob,4,
