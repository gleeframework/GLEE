"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a great value for you, considering its potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a high price, aiming to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm ending with a question to invite Bob to engage in a conversation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk:** Starting high carries the risk of Bob rejecting the offer immediately.
* **Market Research:**  While I don't know Bob's value, I'm assuming the product is potentially worth more than my minimum of $800,000 to him.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and try to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think the product is interesting, but I was hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his previous rejection, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially considering the product's potential value. 
* **Strategic play:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially get a better price in the next round. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is still higher than my minimum but lower than my initial offer, keeping in mind Bob's willingness to pay $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? This price reflects the product's value and would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting value again:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my counter-offer.
* **Focusing on the deal:**  I'm expressing a desire to move forward with the sale, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a compromise:** By offering a price in the middle ground, I'm trying to find a solution that's acceptable to both of us.
* **Testing the waters:** This counter-offer will give me a better understanding of Bob's willingness to negotiate further.
* **Staying above my minimum:** My counter-offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $925000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  I've already made a significant concession by dropping my price from $1,000,000 to $925,000.  Further negotiation might not yield a substantial increase. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I might end up selling to John for a lower price.

**Strategic Decision:**

In this situation, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option. It allows me to secure a price that's very close to my minimum, minimizing potential losses. I'm also aware that pushing for a higher price could risk losing the deal altogether."
