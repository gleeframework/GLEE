"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a real game-changer and I know it will be valuable to you. I'm asking $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, but still below what the product is worth to Bob. This gives him room to negotiate, but also shows him I'm serious about getting a good price.  I'm leaving room for counteroffers and negotiation, but I'm also setting a clear expectation that I won't settle for anything too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is more than my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth it for you in the long run."", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 
 
I'm proposing a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $880,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  While Bob is getting closer to my desired amount, I believe I can get a bit more.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting a sense we're close to a deal.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to make sure it's a good one.  Let's close this out and get you started!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price that's closer to my ideal. I'm also using positive language to emphasize the potential benefits of the product and to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  I'd be happy to close the deal right now for $890,000. This offer demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Bob's offer of $890,000 is only $10,000 away from my last counteroffer, and I'm concerned I might not get a better deal. It's a good price considering my minimum and John's offer.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
