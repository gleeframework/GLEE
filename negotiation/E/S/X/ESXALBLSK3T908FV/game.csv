"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000 right now.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $14000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle, though.  I'll offer $9500.  Let me know if you're willing to go that low.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10200.0,Alice,5,
