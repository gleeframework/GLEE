"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant discount considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price point. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Even if the negotiations fail, you can still buy from John for the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer. While the product sounds promising,  $1,500,000 is at the upper limit of what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This still allows me to make a decent profit while offering you a fair price. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,500,000 to $1,350,000. This is a significant reduction and represents a good deal. While further negotiation might be possible, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further, and the risk of losing the product and having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it. Accepting the offer saves $150,000."
