"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a little lower than Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I want to leave room for Bob to counteroffer without immediately resorting to John's offer.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $130? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise. It's still above my minimum value and closer to my initial offer than John's price. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:** There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price or a stalemate, potentially forcing me to sell to John.
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
