"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's room for negotiation since Alice's offer is above her minimum value of $120. 
* **Time to counter:**  By rejecting, you can initiate a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $130? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
