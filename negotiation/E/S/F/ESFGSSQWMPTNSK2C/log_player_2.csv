"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. I know this is a significant investment, but I'm confident that you'll find it to be worth every penny.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to sell it to someone who I think will truly appreciate it. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.
