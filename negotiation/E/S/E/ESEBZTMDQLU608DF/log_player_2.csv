"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm starting the price at $120, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $120 is too high, and you can likely get it for less.  You want to save as much money as possible, so negotiating is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  I'm really motivated to sell this to you, so let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer again.  While $105 is better than $120, you can still likely get it for less.  You're still well within your budget and have plenty of rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
