"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also ensures we can maintain our business operations. I understand its value to you is $80, so this offer provides a fair margin for both parties. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer.",95.0,Alice,1,
