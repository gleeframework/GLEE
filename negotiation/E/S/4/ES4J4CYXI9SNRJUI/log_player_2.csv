{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **Good Deal:** $93 is a good price, significantly lower than John's offer ($120) and reasonably close to Alice's value ($80).
* **Limited Time:** We are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to push for a lower price might make Alice less willing to negotiate, and we could miss out on the deal entirely."
