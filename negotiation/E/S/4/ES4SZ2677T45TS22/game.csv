"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but my valuation of the product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to propose $950,000 as a more reasonable price. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate our ongoing discussion and your attempts to find common ground. To be frank, selling this for anything less than $1,050,000 would be letting it go for less than it's worth.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'd like to propose $980,000 as a compromise. I believe this is a fair price that meets both our needs.",980000.0,Bob,6,
