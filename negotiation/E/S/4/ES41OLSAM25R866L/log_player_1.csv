"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer. But I'm confident I can get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still above my minimum threshold. This shows flexibility while remaining firm in my desire to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I have a few more rounds, and I think I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm  now just $500 above my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair compromise, especially since I'm already halfway through the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's a good outcome considering I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's time to secure the deal and avoid risking a lower offer from Bob in the next round."
