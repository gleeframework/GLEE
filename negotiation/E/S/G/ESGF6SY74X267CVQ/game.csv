"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than the value you've placed on it, while still giving me a fair profit.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more like $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,375,000?  That way, we can both walk away happy with the deal.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're close, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try to get closer to my original target of $1,300,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway again and try to find a compromise. Can you consider $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle one last time, and go with $1,350,000? It's a fair price that will allow us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
