"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, so there's room to negotiate. It makes sense to reject the initial offer and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident this product can bring you a significant return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his maximum. It's worth attempting another counteroffer to try and get closer to $1,000,000."
