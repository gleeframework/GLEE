"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident this product can bring you a significant return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in your product and my potential return on investment. What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
