"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $14500, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to $14750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",14750.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make a slightly higher counteroffer of $14200. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Would you be willing to consider this price?",14200.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14200. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14500, which is the same price I offered earlier. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to sell it to you at this price. If not, I'm open to discussing further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",14500.0,Alice,7,
