"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. It's priced at $175, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60."", 
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and establishes our price limit.  The goal is to see how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is well below what I need to sell. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Is that something you can work with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still a long way from our ideal price. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $60 is low, Alice, but $110 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

We're now holding firm at our maximum budget. This will be a key point in the negotiation to see if Alice is willing to come down to a price we find acceptable."
