,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too far below my asking price. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still gives you a significant profit, and allows us to make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750,000 is still not enough to cover my costs.  Let's split the difference and go with $900,000.  This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
