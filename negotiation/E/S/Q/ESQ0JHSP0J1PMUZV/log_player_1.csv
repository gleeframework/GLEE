Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's well worth $150. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows you to potentially gain more than your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob doesn't accept $150, the offer opens the door for bargaining. He might counter-offer, and you can potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have the security of John as a backup buyer. If Bob rejects the offer, you don't lose out. 

It's a delicate balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring Bob doesn't walk away."
