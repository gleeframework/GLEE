Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will be telling. If he outright rejects it, you know he might be very price-sensitive. If he counter-offers, you can gauge how much he values the product. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so you can afford to be a bit more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations. If you had more information, you might adjust your approach."
