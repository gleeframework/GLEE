"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $1200000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1500000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that I hope we can both agree on. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
