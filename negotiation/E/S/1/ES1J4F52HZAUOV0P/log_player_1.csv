Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it presents significant value, and this is a competitive offer. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but lower than John's guaranteed offer ($15,000).  This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (""significant value"", ""competitive offer"") might make Bob more receptive.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in discussion. 

**Important Considerations:**

* We don't want to go too low initially, as we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000.
* The message aims to balance assertiveness with a willingness to negotiate."
