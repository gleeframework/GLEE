"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on a high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $8750 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it, and hopefully we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment.",9200.0,Alice,5,
