"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me.  While I'm interested, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
