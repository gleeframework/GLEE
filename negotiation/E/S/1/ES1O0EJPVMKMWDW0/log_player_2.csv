# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

While $9,000 is still higher than your ideal price, it's a good compromise. You're still saving $3,000 compared to buying from John."
