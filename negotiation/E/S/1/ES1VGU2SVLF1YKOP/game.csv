"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I know you value it at that price as well. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,1,
