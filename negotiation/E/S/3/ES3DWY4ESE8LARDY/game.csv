"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $12,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a fair price, I need to be closer to my asking price to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can come to an agreement. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
