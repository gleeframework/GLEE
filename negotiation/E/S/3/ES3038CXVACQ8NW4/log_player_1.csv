{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum $8,000, so you're already starting strong.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  At $10,000, there's room for negotiation, making it more likely Bob will at least consider the offer.

By starting at $10,000, you give yourself room to negotiate downwards if needed, while still maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about $9,000?  I'm really interested in this product and think we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very close to your minimum price and it's likely he won't go any lower.  Accepting his offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations that could lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
