Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give insight into his level of interest and potential for negotiation. If he immediately rejects it, a lower offer closer to $8,000 might be necessary.  
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000.  This knowledge allows you to be more confident in your negotiation with Bob."
