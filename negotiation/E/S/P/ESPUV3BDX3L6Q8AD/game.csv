"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, and I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $14,000 is a little too low, I'm willing to accept $15,500. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $15,500, which would be $14,750. Can you accept that price?",14750.0,Bob,6,
