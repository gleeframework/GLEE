"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  I'm confident that I can still get a good price, even if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125.  It's still a bit higher than Bob's last offer, but it's closer to my minimum value and hopefully still appealing enough for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 122}
```

I'm going to counter with $122. This is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping that with only 5 rounds left, Bob will be more willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $119
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We are in round 6, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I don't think I can secure a higher price in the remaining rounds.  John offers a safe and sure $120, which is my minimum, so it's the best option at this point."
