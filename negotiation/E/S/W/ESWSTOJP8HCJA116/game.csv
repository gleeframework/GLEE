"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and allows us both to benefit from this opportunity.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
