"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're willing to invest in this product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $700,000. Considering its true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll derive from it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I can go up to $750,000.  That's a significant investment, and I believe it's a fair offer considering its value.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the true value of the product to you. I'm offering it to you for $800,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the value you'll derive from it.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $800,000 is closer, but I need to see a bit more movement. Would you consider $775,000? That's a strong offer and reflects the value I place on it.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a strong offer. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm offering it to you for $825,000.
