"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be fair to propose a price of $950000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product.  It's worth exploring if we can get a better price. We'll start with a counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $950,000 is above my current budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her valuation. This shows we're serious about buying but also sets a clear target for negotiation.  We'll see if Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer of $900000 for the product. We believe this price reflects its value while remaining within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. It's important to keep pushing for a lower price. We'll make another counteroffer in the next round to try and close the gap.  We're still better off than buying from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $875,000. This would give you a good profit while staying within my budget. "", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're inching closer to a deal.  By splitting the difference, we show flexibility while still pushing for a lower price. Alice is likely to accept, but if not, we're still in a good position to continue negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your proposal, Alice would like to suggest a price of $890000 for the product. This offer aims to provide a reasonable profit while remaining competitive with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within a range I'm comfortable with.  While I'd love to push for a lower price, the risk of further negotiations and the possibility of Alice rejecting my counteroffer, combined with the time pressure, make this a good point to accept the deal.  It's still significantly cheaper than buying from John."
