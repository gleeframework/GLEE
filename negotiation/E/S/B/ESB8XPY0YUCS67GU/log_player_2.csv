"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is well within your budget of $150. Accepting the offer allows you to get the product at a good price without risking further negotiation. There's no need to potentially lose time and potentially get a worse price with John."
