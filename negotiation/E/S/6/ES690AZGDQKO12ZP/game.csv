"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While I see where you're coming from, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you significant value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000? I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer to show my commitment to the deal, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
