"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",8000.0,Alice,3,
