{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's a potential profit margin of $200,000 ($1,000,000 - $800,000).

By offering the product at $925,000:

* **You secure a significant portion of the profit margin.** 
* **You present Bob with a compelling offer**, saving him $75,000 compared to his own valuation.
* **You leave some room for negotiation** should Bob try to counter-offer.

**Important:** This assumes you have no further information about Bob's negotiation style or financial constraints."
