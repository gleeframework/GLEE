"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for this product.  Let's keep negotiating, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this offer?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $1,025,000 is still a little below what I need.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,037,500?  I'm feeling generous, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,037,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",1030000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm really hoping to get closer to $1,050,000 for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,040,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's still within a reasonable range for you. ",1040000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but $1,040,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000, but I think we're getting close to the maximum I can afford. Can you consider one last offer?",1030000.0,Bob,8,
