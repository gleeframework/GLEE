Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a fair starting point, considering my minimum value of $80 and the fact that I don't know Bob's valuation.  I'm hoping to get as close to his maximum value as possible without risking losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum value.  While I'd prefer more, accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
