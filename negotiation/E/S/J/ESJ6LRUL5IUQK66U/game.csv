"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000 for the product. This would still leave you a healthy profit margin while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves plenty of room for you to profit from this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking to get the product for closer to $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
