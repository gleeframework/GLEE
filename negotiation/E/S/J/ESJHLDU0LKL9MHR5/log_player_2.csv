"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He has a clear goal to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than the $15,000 he'd pay John, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  There's a chance he could get the price down closer to Alice's value of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible price, and a counteroffer of $11,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but is not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is slightly higher than her initial price, it is still within Bob's budget.  However, Bob should continue negotiating.  He can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer.  It's likely Alice will be willing to move slightly closer to his preferred price of $11,000 to avoid losing the sale completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.  This counteroffer of $11,500 is a compromise between his previous offer of $11,000 and Alice's latest offer of $12,500.  It keeps the negotiation moving while giving Alice a little more room to bargain without getting too close to her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's still a better price than what he'd pay John ($15,000). 

* **Previous Counteroffers:**  Bob has already made multiple counteroffers, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.  
* **Alice's Increasing Price:**  Alice's offer is steadily increasing, showing that she's not willing to drop her price much further. 
* **Risk of Loss:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice rejecting Bob's offers and potentially ending the deal. Bob might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.

It's better to secure the product for a price that's still within his budget than risk losing the deal and having to pay more later."
