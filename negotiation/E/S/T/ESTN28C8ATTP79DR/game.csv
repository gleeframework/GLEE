"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. While  $600,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm open to finding a compromise. Could you consider $850,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $725,000 is getting closer, but to be candid, I have a hard limit at $800,000.  This is a final offer -  I believe it's a fair price that recognizes its value. ",800000.0,Alice,5,
