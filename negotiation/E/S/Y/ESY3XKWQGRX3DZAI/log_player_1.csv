Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for potential counteroffers without dropping below my minimum value.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy to either push for a higher price or concede to a lower one, while always keeping in mind my minimum value of $10,000 and the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum value of $10,000. I'm not ready to settle for that yet.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Holding Out for a Better Deal:**  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  However, $10,500 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and go with $11,750? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between our current offers, creating an opportunity for a win-win scenario. 
* **Maintaining Value:** By staying above $10,000, I'm ensuring that I'm still getting a good price for the product, while also being reasonable in my negotiations.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation if Bob still isn't happy with the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  I could meet you halfway between our last offers, at $11,125.  Do you think that would work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Goal:** Bob's offer of $11,125 is quite close to my desired price point. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject his offer, there's a chance he might walk away completely, and I'd be left with the less desirable option of selling to John for $10,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** The back-and-forth negotiation might be wearing Bob down. Accepting his offer now could be a good way to finalize the deal without risking further haggling.

**Conclusion:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, the potential risk of losing the deal and the relatively small difference in price make accepting Bob's offer the best choice in this scenario."
