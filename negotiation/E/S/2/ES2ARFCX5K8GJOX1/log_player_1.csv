"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for the largest possible profit. I'm confident that the product is worth more to Bob, so I'm leaving room for negotiation.  However, I'm also aware of John's offer of $800,000, so I'm not going to overplay my hand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I need to be mindful of John's offer, I'm not going to sell for less than $800,000 if I can avoid it. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit to show some flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer. I believe this offer is reasonable, considering Bob's initial offer and the fact that the product is worth $1,000,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not going to settle for less than $800,000 if I can get more. I'm still confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  John's offer is a safety net, but I'm going to keep pushing for more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly again, demonstrating willingness to compromise.  However, this offer is still significantly higher than John's offer, and I believe Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is only $10,000 above John's offer. With only 4 rounds left, the chances of getting a better price are slim. It's time to lock in the guaranteed profit and sell to John."
