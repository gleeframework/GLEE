You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob seems to have hit his ceiling. Accepting $108 guarantees a good profit above our minimum, and continuing the negotiation risks him lowering his offer or us having to settle for John's $80 offer."
