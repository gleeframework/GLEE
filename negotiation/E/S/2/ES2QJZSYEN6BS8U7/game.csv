"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer you $700,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again.  How about we settle on $775,000? This is a fair compromise for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000.

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a final compromise. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.
