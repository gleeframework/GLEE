"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $11500. This is a good price for both of us, and I think we can come to an agreement. What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'm happy to buy the product from John for the same price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
