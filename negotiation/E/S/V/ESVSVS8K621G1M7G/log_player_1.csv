Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good practice in negotiations to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""incredible value and potential"" of the product, you aim to justify the high price and pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""mutually beneficial agreement"" signals your willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in reaching a deal.

This approach allows you to:

1. **Test Bob's willingness to pay:**  If he accepts immediately, you've potentially maximized your profit.
2. **Set a strong anchor:** Even if he rejects the initial offer, it establishes a high reference point for future negotiations. 
3. **Maintain your walk-away option:**  You always have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000) but still significantly below both your asking price and your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is considerably below what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By coming down from your initial offer, you demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  The counteroffer of $1,450,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer and keeps you in a good negotiating position.
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's value subtly reminds Bob of its worth and justifies the higher price. 
* **Aim for the Middle Ground:** The ""meet in the middle"" approach can be an effective negotiation tactic, encouraging a sense of fairness. 

This counteroffer:

1. **Tests Bob's flexibility:** It encourages him to move closer to your desired price. 
2. **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  If he rejects this offer, you can still negotiate down slightly while remaining above your minimum.
3. **Keeps the John option open:** You retain the option to walk away if Bob's counteroffers remain unacceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, it's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and there's always a risk he could walk away from the negotiation entirely. Accepting this offer guarantees you a profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John at your minimum."
