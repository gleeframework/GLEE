"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire a remarkable product that holds significant value for you. Given its importance to you, I believe it's important to ensure that the transaction respects both our interests and the true worth of the item. Considering its intrinsic value and the benefits it offers, I propose to sell the product to you for $1,200,000.

This offer reflects a fair compromise between the value I see in the product and the value you place on it. It allows me to recoup a substantial portion of the investment made in acquiring this product while also ensuring that you receive it at a price that is more favorable than what I would charge another interested party. I trust that this proposal will facilitate a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Please let me know if you require any additional information or if you wish to proceed with this offer. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to work together.

Best regards,
Alice
