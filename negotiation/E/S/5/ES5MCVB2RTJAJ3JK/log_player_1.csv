Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to entice him but also leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for John:**  I'm still leaving myself open to selling to John for $15,000 if Bob rejects my offer.
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'm open to counteroffers, but I'll be firm in my stance that the product is worth at least $15,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my desired value.  
* **John is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but unfortunately, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $12,000, but not by too much.
* **Maintain value:**  $11,000 is still significantly more than Bob's initial offer, but closer to his perceived value, hopefully increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Clear communication:**  I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob and reminding him of the potential benefit he'll get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I value the product at.
* **Limited negotiation room:** I've already compromised and shown flexibility.  Further negotiation could drag on and potentially result in a lower price for me.
* **John's offer is a sure thing:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a profitable sale and avoids further time and effort spent negotiating with Bob."
