"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but unfortunately, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement",10500.0,Bob,4,
