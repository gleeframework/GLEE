"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product. While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $12,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $11,000, and I think that's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $11,500. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",11500.0,Alice,5,
