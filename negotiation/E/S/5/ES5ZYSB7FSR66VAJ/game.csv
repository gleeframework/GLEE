"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to compromise, though. I can offer it to you for $1350000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1250000. I can offer it to you for $1300000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your continued negotiation. I'm willing to meet you at $1260000, but I'd like to add a condition: I'll throw in some additional support and training to help you get the most out of the product. This will be a value-add of $50000. So, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1310000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll receive",1310000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional support and training you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1280000 for the product, but I'd like to negotiate the value of the additional support and training. Can we discuss a lower value for that component?",1280000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to compromise on the value of the additional support and training. Let's say we value it at $20000 instead of $50000. This brings the total price to $1300000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for this price, but I need to know if this is something you're willing to accept. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise on the value of the additional support and training. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1290000 for the product, but I think that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1500000.",1290000.0,Bob,10,
