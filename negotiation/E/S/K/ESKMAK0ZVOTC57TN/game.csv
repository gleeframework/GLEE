"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  It's not fair to me given the value of this product. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering both our perspectives. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $12,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",12250.0,Bob,4,
