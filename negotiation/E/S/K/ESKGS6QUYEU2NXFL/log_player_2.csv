"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're getting close to a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $1,050,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
