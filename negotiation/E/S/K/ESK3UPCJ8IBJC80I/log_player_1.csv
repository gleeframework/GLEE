Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount,  $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
