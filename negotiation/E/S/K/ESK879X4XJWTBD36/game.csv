"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
