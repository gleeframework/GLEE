"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is significantly lower than what I need. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to continue negotiating with you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 still falls short of what I need. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do at this point.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to drop my price one last time to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do. If you're serious about buying the product, I suggest you accept this offer. ",1000000.0,Alice,7,
