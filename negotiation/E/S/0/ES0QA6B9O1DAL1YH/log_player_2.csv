{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You're trying to save money, and since you have 10 rounds, you can try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate. By increasing your offer slightly from $12,000 to $12,500, you show a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below your maximum budget."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has lowered her price to $13,000, which is only $1,000 more than your last counteroffer. This is a good compromise, and it's likely that further negotiations will be incremental and time-consuming.  Accepting the offer secures the product for you at a reasonable price, leaving you with a bit of wiggle room for potential future price drops."
