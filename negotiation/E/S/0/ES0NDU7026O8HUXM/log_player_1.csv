"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:**  My message emphasizes the value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  This price allows for potential counteroffers and gives me some flexibility to adjust if necessary.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a price as close to my minimum value as possible.  I'll use the remaining rounds to gauge Bob's interest, adjust my offer accordingly, and if necessary, switch to John to ensure I don't lose out on my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for your product. I believe this aligns more closely with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.  Selling to John at this point would guarantee me my minimum, but I still have 8 rounds left.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next rounds. I'm willing to concede some ground, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum value. The remaining rounds give me leverage to push for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great opportunity for you, and it's a reasonable compromise on my end."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $11,500, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above his offer. 
* **Appeal to fairness:**  I emphasize that $11,500 is a fair price and a great opportunity for him. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  I don't completely cave in to his offer, leaving room for further negotiation in the next rounds. 

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.  I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is my final offer.  If Bob rejects this, I'll be more likely to sell to John in the next round."
