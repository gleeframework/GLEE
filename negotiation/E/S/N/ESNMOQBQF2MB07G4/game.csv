"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a rare find, and I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my maximum budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1600000 to make it worth my while. I'm confident that this product will bring significant value to you, and I'm willing to compromise on the price to make the deal happen.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1600000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to split the difference and offer $1300000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I believe this product will bring me.  I'm confident that this offer is mutually beneficial and allows us to finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not convinced that $1300000 is enough to justify the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1300000 and $1600000, which would be $1450000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value and my costs.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
