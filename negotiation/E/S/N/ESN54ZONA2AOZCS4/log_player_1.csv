""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share such a valuable product. While I understand its worth, my budget allows me to pay up to $1,200,000 for it. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed offer. There's no point in further negotiation with Bob.  We can secure the maximum value for the product by selling it to John immediately."
