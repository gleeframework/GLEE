"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not comfortable with that price point.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  I think that's a fair offer considering its worth to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects its value to me, while also acknowledging your concerns about the price. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value for both of us.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm still not comfortable with $760,000. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, which is closer to my initial offer. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to me. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
