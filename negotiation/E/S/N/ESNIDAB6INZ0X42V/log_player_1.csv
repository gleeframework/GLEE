Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's  higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if he's willing to pay closer to his $12,000 valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very close to my ideal price, and I'm confident I won't get a better deal if I continue negotiating.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing him and having to settle for John's lower offer."
