"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. Let me know if you're interested, and we can finalize the details.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
