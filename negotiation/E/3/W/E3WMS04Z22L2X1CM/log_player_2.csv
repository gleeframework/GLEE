"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and $110 is still above his maximum budget of $120.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a budget, but I still think this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $108. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $108 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly above his ideal price.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, so it's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $107?"", ""product_price"": 107}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can do $109, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice has come down in price, $109 is still a bit above his ideal.  Since it's early in the negotiation process (only round 5), there's still room to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $108?"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close now. I'm willing to meet you at $109, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer:** Alice has made it clear this is her final offer. 
* **Close to budget:** While $109 is still above Bob's ideal price of $100, it's only $9 above his maximum budget of $120. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Rejecting this offer risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.

It's likely that Alice will not budge further.  Accepting the offer minimizes the risk of paying more while still getting a decent deal."
