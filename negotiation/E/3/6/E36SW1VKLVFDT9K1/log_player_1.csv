Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows for the possibility of a counter-offer, keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $120. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below the minimum I'm willing to accept ($150).  By rejecting the offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price and hopefully find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135, which is still a good value for you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $120 as my maximum price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go higher than $120.  While I could continue to counter-offer, it's unlikely he'll change his mind.  Selling to John for $150 is the best option to ensure I meet my minimum price goal."
