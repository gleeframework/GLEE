"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, valued at $15,000 to you, Bob. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000, a one-time offer that I think you won't want to pass up! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $15,000.  There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's initial offer.  She might be willing to come down a bit further, especially knowing you have an alternative."
