Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  Given its value, I think a price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" I'm subtly suggesting that the product is worth more than Bob might think.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** My tone is friendly and I explicitly ask for Bob's opinion, signaling my willingness to negotiate.

It's unlikely Bob will accept this initial offer, but it sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I have room to negotiate and a guaranteed offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Could you consider $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** I've significantly lowered my price from $22,000, showing flexibility. However, I'm still holding firm above my $15,000 minimum and closer to my initial offer. 
* **Encouraging a Higher Counter:** By countering with $19,000, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to offer something above his initial $12,000.  This keeps the negotiation moving towards a potentially mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap significantly. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, which meets my minimum. It makes the most financial sense to take the guaranteed sale."
