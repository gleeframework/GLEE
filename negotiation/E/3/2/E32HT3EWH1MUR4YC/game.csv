"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8500.  This still gives you a good profit, and it's a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $9250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  I'm still hoping to get the product for a bit less.  How about $9000? That's a fair deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to closing the deal. Let's see if we can agree on this.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point.  $9000 is a good price, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  How about we split the difference and go with $9125? This is a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a final agreement.  What do you think?",9125.0,Alice,5,
