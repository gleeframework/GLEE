Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8500.  This still gives you a good profit, and it's a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  I'm still hoping to get the product for a bit less.  How about $9000? That's a fair deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to closing the deal. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point.  $9,000 is a good price, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,125? This is a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a final agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9125}
