"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I know it's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $135. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $135 is less than your maximum price of $150 and cheaper than buying from John for $150. This saves you money."
