"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,100,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you and the price I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
