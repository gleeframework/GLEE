"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your perspective on the product's value.  While $1,800,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $2,100,000.  I'm confident this reflects the true potential of what we're discussing.  What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $2,100,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant.
