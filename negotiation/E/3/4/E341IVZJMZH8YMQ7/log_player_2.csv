You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've negotiated a price of $8,125, saving $1,875 from both John's price and Alice's initial offer.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price. 

While you might be able to get the price down a little more, it's not guaranteed and could cost you the deal. Accepting now secures a good price."
