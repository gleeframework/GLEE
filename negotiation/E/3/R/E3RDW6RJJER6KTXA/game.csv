"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $13,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the product's value. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll consider other offers.",13250.0,Alice,5,
