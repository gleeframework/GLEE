Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good strategy to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to maximizing your profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $100 to you, you are subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room for Counter Offer:**  While the price is higher than what Bob values the product at, it gives him an opportunity to counter-offer. If he's truly interested, he might negotiate a price closer to his perceived value. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you don't lose anything by aiming higher with Bob."
