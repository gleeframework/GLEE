"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that offer is tempting, I believe this product's inherent value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,850,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true potential.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
