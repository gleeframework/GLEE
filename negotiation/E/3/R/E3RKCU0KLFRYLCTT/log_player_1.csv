Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that offer is tempting, I believe this product's inherent value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,850,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true potential."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

We're getting closer, but I still think we can get Bob closer to a price that reflects the product's value. It's too early to settle for a price that's too far below what I believe it's worth."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $1,775,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,650,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  $1,650,000 is still a substantial profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging out the negotiations further could make Bob less willing to compromise. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I have the capital available sooner for other opportunities. 

Accepting this offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
