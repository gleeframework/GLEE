This allows for a significant profit margin for you while also reflecting the true value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the full value of this product for your company.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $975,000. This allows for a substantial profit margin for you while still leaving me a fair return on my investment.  Let's finalize this deal and unlock the potential of this product together.",975000.0,Alice,3,
