"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but  $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is too far below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $1,450,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product brings you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,550,000 is very close, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,525,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our progress so far.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,525,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Given the limited rounds remaining and the risk of losing the deal altogether, it's in my best interest to accept this offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the potential of losing this deal and getting only $1,500,000 from John makes this a reasonable compromise."
