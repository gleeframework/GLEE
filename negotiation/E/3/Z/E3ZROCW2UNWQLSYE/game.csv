,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $16500, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $16500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counteroffer at $15000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $16000, which is still a great deal for me, and I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think we can meet at $15750. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering buying from John.",15750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16250, but I need to make it clear that this is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm starting to get a bit concerned that you're not taking this seriously enough. I'm willing to sell to John for $15000, and I'd rather not let the deal slip away.",16250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counteroffer at $15875. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",15875.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've compromised a lot already, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but that's it. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling to John, and I'm sure he'll be happy to take it from me.",17000.0,Alice,9,
