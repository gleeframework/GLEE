"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first.  $100 is a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it for $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

I'm aiming to get the price closer to Alice's perceived value of $80.  Starting with a counteroffer of $85 gives us some room to negotiate while staying well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not in a rush. Let's see if we can nudge her down a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $90? That feels like a fair price to me."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

We're splitting the difference again to encourage Alice towards a price that works for both of us. It keeps the negotiation moving while still leaving room to go up slightly if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're close to the price I'm looking for! However, I'm not willing to go up to $90 just yet. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $92. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to get as close to $95 as possible.  While we could likely push her a little further, $92 is a good price and it's not worth the risk of her backing out or the time it would take to negotiate further."
