"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. This is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $11000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  Since I have a guaranteed option to purchase the product for $10,000 from John, I'll take that deal and avoid further negotiation."
