"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000, which still reflects the value of the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
