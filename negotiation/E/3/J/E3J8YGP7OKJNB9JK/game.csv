"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
