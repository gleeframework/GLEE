Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the unique advantages of the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is stuck at $1,200,000. It's time to show him we're serious about a higher price and willing to walk away if necessary. This might push him closer to our desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I value your interest, but I must be upfront â€“ I have other potential buyers for this product. To be fair to them and reflecting the product's worth, my final offer is $1,250,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it's more than reasonable for the value you're gaining."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** By stating this is our ""final offer"" and a ""firm price,"" we create a sense of urgency and show we're serious about the value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""other potential buyers"" reminds Bob of the product's desirability and our alternative options. 
* **Slight Concession:**  We've moved closer to his price, showing some flexibility while staying above our minimum.

This approach aims to either close the deal quickly at a favorable price or make Bob realize he needs to significantly increase his offer to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about other potential buyers, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can only go up to $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it. I'm still very interested in the product, but I need to make a responsible decision for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. Continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving us with John's lower offer.
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  Holding out for more than $1,225,000 might yield minimal gains compared to the potential loss of $225,000 if the deal falls through.
* **Bob's Seriousness:**  His ""final offer"" statement and budget concerns indicate he's unlikely to move much higher.

Accepting $1,225,000 secures a substantial profit above our minimum and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
