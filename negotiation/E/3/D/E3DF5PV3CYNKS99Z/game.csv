"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I value your interest, but I must be upfront â€“ I have other potential buyers for this product. To be fair to them and reflecting the product's worth, my final offer is $1,250,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it's more than reasonable for the value you're gaining.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns about other potential buyers, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can only go up to $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it. I'm still very interested in the product, but I need to make a responsible decision for my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
