"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties looking at this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is the lowest I can go.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet you halfway, but $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1600000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1650000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $1650000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1580000, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",1580000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about my costs. I'm counteroffering at $1620000. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1620000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $1620000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1590000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",1590000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made significant concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the bottom line. I'm willing to make one more move, but I need to think about my costs and the value of the product. I'm counteroffering at $1615000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1615000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $1615000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1580000, but I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the negotiation process. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller who is willing to give me a better deal.",1580000.0,Bob,10,
