"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $10000 for it.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth it to you.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $7500.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $7500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8500?  This allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $8250?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",8250.0,Bob,4,
