Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the offer of $600,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant value it will bring to your operations.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations that's proving hard to bridge.  To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price. However, I value our discussions and believe this product can be a great asset for you. I'm willing to make a substantial move to $1,600,000.  Let's see if we can find an agreement quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, the price is still far above your maximum budget. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further before resorting to John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I have other options for this purchase. I can offer you $800,000, which is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore those other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
