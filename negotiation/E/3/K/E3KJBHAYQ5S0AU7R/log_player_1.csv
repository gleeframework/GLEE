"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):** I begin significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:** The initial price is negotiable.  It aims to establish a high anchor point. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and benefits, creating a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is simply too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below even his own perceived value. This could indicate:

* **Strong Negotiation Tactic:**  Bob might be trying to anchor the negotiation extremely low.
* **Misunderstanding of Value:** Bob may not fully grasp the product's potential.

**Next Steps in Round 3:**  I will counter with a price significantly closer to my minimum but still above it, aiming to signal flexibility while maintaining a firm stance on the product's worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the offer of $600,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant value it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, but Above Minimum:** The counteroffer drops the price considerably to show flexibility. However, it remains well above my $1,500,000 minimum and closer to my initial offer, reinforcing the product's high value. 
* **Value-Focused Messaging:**  The message reiterates the product's potential benefits for Bob, subtly countering his low valuation.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The tone remains confident and firm, avoiding the appearance of desperation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart on price.  I understand its value, but I need to be realistic about what I can afford.  Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair jump from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer by only $100,000, which indicates he might be trying to wear me down with small increments.  We are still very far from a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative Option:** I have a strong alternative with John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. 

**Next Steps in Round 5:** I will significantly decrease my offer, but keep it above John's offer to test Bob's willingness to move towards a more reasonable price. I will also hint at the possibility of accepting John's offer if we can't bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations that's proving hard to bridge.  To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price. However, I value our discussions and believe this product can be a great asset for you. I'm willing to make a substantial move to $1,600,000.  Let's see if we can find an agreement quickly."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession and Time Pressure:**  I'm making a significant concession, moving closer to my minimum but staying above John's offer. The message also subtly introduces time pressure by mentioning the other buyer and the need to ""find an agreement quickly.""
* **Testing Commitment:** This offer will reveal Bob's true level of interest. If he's serious, he needs to make a substantial counter-offer now. If not, I'm prepared to walk away and accept John's offer. 
* **Transparency and Value Emphasis:**  I remain transparent about having another offer, but I reiterate the product's value for Bob, aiming for a win-win if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I have other options for this purchase. I can offer you $800,000, which is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore those other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has reached his maximum perceived value ($800,000), and I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Upside:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. He has signaled his limit, and I've already made a substantial concession.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Further rounds with Bob represent lost time and potential for other deals. Accepting John's offer provides certainty and immediate value. 

**Conclusion:**  While I aim for mutually beneficial deals, Bob's final offer falls too far short.  It's in my best interest to sell the product to John at the guaranteed higher price."
