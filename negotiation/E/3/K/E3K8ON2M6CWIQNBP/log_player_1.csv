"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as $950,000 is still below my minimum value of $800,000. I have 9 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is fair considering the product's value to you and allows me to still profit from the sale. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, $1,000,000 is still a good profit for me and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
