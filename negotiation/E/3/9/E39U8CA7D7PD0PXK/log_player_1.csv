Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit for Bob:**  Bob stands to gain $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) if he buys from you at your minimum.

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that potential profit as possible without risking Bob rejecting the deal. Offering a price slightly below his perceived value makes the deal very attractive.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm offering it at a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Fair Price:** $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a $50,000 gain.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if there's only John) adds a bit of pressure for Bob to act quickly.
* **Respectful Tone:** The language is professional and avoids being overly aggressive.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward, but always keep your minimum price in mind."
