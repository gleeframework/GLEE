Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you, but $11,500 is still just a bit too low. How about $11,750?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11600, but no more. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred a higher price, this is a good compromise. It's a better deal than selling to John for $10,000, and it's likely that further negotiation won't lead to a significantly higher price."
