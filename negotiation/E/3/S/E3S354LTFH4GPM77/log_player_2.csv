Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,750.

``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. The price is within his budget, and it is lower than buying from John.  Further negotiation might save him a few more dollars, but the risk of Alice rejecting and potentially going back to her original price of $9,000 outweighs the potential savings."
