Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is a bit too high for me, but I'm definitely interested in the product. How about we bring it down to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is too low, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $1,900,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $1,450,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still in a position to negotiate. Accepting his offer now would leave money on the table.  I'll push for a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're getting close! I understand the budget considerations, and I want to see us reach an agreement.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,675,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting very close.  I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we make it a clean $1,550,000 and close the deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now offering $50,000 above my minimum. While I could try to push for more, it's getting late in the negotiation, and there's a risk he walks away. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of having to sell to John at my minimum."
