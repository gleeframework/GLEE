"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a price that fits within his budget."
