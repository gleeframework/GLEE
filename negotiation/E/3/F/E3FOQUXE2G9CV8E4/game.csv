"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still offers you a substantial value, while also ensuring a fair return for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher on my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm thinking $1,080,000 is a fair price for the product. I believe it's a good balance between my budget and the value I see in the product.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
