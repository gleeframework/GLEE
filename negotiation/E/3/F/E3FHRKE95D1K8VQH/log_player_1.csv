Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I can come down slightly to $1,200,000.  This is a very competitive price for something with this much potential."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

We're still significantly below John's offer. Bob is clearly interested and slowly increasing his offer. It's time to push back a bit harder and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Let's make this easier â€“ I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This counteroffer shows firmness while still leaving some room for negotiation (though minimal).
* **""Final offer"" tactic:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and potentially push Bob to make a more decisive move. 
* **Closing the gap:** We are moving closer to John's offer, giving us a potential safety net if Bob refuses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob is moving in very small increments, and we've already presented our ""final offer."" It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer in the remaining rounds. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees the $1,000,000, while continuing with Bob carries the risk of ending up with less or a stalemate.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation with Bob has an opportunity cost.  Accepting John's offer allows us to move on to other potential deals."
