Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This price is fair given the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price is still fair considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to offer you $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget. This means Bob can buy the product at his desired price without risking further negotiation or going over budget.  While he could theoretically try to push for a lower price, there's no guarantee that Alice would accept, and it risks the deal falling apart."
