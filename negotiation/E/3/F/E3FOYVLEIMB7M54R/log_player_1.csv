"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value of $150, leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a possible counter-offer from Bob without me immediately feeling the need to go to John. I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by expressing that I think the product is a good fit for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to try to get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $145?  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 
 
I'm aiming for a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer, hoping to create a sense of compromise and move the negotiation forward.  I'm also reiterating my positive attitude towards making the deal work."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $120 is a bit low, but $145 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to reach an agreement before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more.  How about $140? This is my final offer, so let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm aiming to find a middle ground closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $140, so how about $135? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $135 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to make me happy. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not sure if Bob is truly willing to negotiate further. With only a few rounds left, the risk of continuing the negotiation and ending up with a lower price than John's offer is too high. I'd rather sell to John and secure the guaranteed $150."
