Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While your valuation is appreciated,  $1,200,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
