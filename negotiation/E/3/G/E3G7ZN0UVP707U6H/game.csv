"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice.  How about we settle at $100? That's the highest I can go.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to get at least $130 for it. How about we meet in the middle again at $115? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",115.0,Alice,5,
