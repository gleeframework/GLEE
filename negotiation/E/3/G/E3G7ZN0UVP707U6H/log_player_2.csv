Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to get at least $130 for it. How about we meet in the middle again at $115? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

Alice is unlikely to go down to $100.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at this point than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
