Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate and also demonstrates the value I place on the product.  I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000 through the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in continuing negotiations since I can't get a better price."
