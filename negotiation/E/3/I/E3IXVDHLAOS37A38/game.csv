Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $120. What do you think?,110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a great compromise that still reflects its value to you. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $105 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $95. Would that work for you?",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can offer you the product for $102. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the compromise. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $98?",98.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $98. I can offer you the product for $101. It's a slight adjustment, but I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",101.0,Alice,7,
