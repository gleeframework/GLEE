"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a very reasonable price. What do you think about $100? Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $100 is still more than you want to pay.
* You know you can get the product for $120 from John.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her, closer to your $80 target."
