"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will be interested in the product and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a better price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering with $125.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $115. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering I'm only a few rounds away from having to sell to John for $100. I'd rather secure a slightly higher price than risk getting nothing."
