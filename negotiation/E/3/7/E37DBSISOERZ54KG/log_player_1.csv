"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a price that reflects its value. I'm asking for $11,500.  It's a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $10,000. It's worth risking another round to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly.  I'm proposing a price of $10,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I really value your product, but I'm still looking to keep my costs down. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $10,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below that price.  Selling to John for $10,000 is a better option than risking more rounds with Bob and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
