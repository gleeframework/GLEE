"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $20000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is above his budget, and he can likely negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $17,000 for this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $17000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $18,500 is closer to his budget, he can likely negotiate a lower price.  He's still willing to negotiate and hasn't reached his limit yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $17,500 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $18000, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $18200 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $18,200 is getting closer to his budget, he's still aiming for a lower price. He should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm trying to be reasonable here. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $17,800. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $17900, but I still need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $18050 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, it seems unlikely Bob will be able to get the price down to his desired level. While there's still a chance he could negotiate further, Alice is showing a strong resistance to going lower.  The risk of not reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds is high. Buying from John for $15,000 is a more secure and cost-effective option."
