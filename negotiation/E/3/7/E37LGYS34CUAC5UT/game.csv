"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a more comfortable price point for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I propose $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,5,
