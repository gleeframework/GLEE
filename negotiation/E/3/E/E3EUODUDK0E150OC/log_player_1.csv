Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing the product is worth at least $800,000 to me. This sets a high bar and gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, giving me the chance to learn his perceived value and negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll reject it and counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation."
