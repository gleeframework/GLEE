"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is too high. We should try to negotiate a lower price, closer to her value of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims low to leave room for negotiation but is still a reasonable markup from Alice's value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $85. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better, we can likely get it lower. We'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving towards a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $75?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We're inching closer to a deal. This counteroffer splits the difference of the previous round and is still a reasonable profit margin for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not ready to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you at $82.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit, and while we *might* be able to get the price down a tiny bit more, it's getting risky.  $82.50 is a decent price, and continuing to negotiate could make Alice less willing to deal. It's better to secure a good price now than risk having to buy from John for $100."
