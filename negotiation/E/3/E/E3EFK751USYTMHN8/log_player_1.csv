"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  However, I'm willing to negotiate. I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get more. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a higher price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $960,000 is still a very good deal. It's only $40,000 less than my last counteroffer and significantly more than what I'd get from John. Accepting this offer will secure a good profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
