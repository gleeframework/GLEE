Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for both of you.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

Aim high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You start by highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" to frame the product as desirable.
* **Strong Price:** $1,150,000 is a strong opening, giving you room to potentially negotiate down slightly if needed while still staying above your minimum.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""significant benefits"" Bob will gain, you subtly remind him of the product's value to him, justifying the price.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
