Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I'm not sure I can meet your asking price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay up to $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, given its value to me. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $900,000. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to me. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

While Bob is moving towards my price, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result than John's offer.  It's time to move on."
