"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate and should aim for a much lower price.  Buying from John right now would be settling for the maximum price without even trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget in mind.  I'd be willing to offer $600,000."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer. However, $600,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers a unique value proposition and has the potential to generate significant returns. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $950,000? This would represent a fair compromise, considering its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, $950,000 is still too high. We started quite low with our initial counter offer, so there's room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but $950,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $725,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the product's value."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for staying with me in this negotiation.  I can tell you're serious. While $725,000 is closer to a realistic price, it's still a significant gap from what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $875,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

This is a tricky situation. Alice has come down significantly, but her ""final offer"" is still above our maximum budget.  There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and we risk her sticking to this price or even walking away in further rounds.  

It's tempting to try and negotiate further, but at this point, the risk outweighs the potential reward. Buying from John for $800,000 ensures we get the product within our budget."
