# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Her flowery language about the product's value to you doesn't change the fact that:

* You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000.
* You have a guaranteed alternative at that price.

Therefore, it's in your best interest to reject Alice's offer and see if she'll come down further. If not, you can always go with John."
