Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $850,000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I understand your offer is closer to my minimum, but $725,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise further, and I'm confident that $800,000 is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I think I've gotten as low as I'm willing to go, and Alice is still not budging. Since her offer of $800,000 is the same as what John is offering, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John.
