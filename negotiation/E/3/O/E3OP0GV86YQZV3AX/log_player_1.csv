Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm not sure if it's worth the full $900,000. Let me know if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $850,000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $850,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $725,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $725,000 is still too low. I'm not ready to accept yet.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I understand your offer is closer to my minimum, but $725,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise further, and I'm confident that $800,000 is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
