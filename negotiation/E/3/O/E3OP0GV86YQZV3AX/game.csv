"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm not sure if it's worth the full $900,000. Let me know if we can meet in the middle.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $850,000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $850,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $725,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I understand your offer is closer to my minimum, but $725,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise further, and I'm confident that $800,000 is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
