Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also important to remember that I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept it just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for profit. I'm hoping this will be a good enough price to convince Bob to buy the product without me having to drop my price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $155 is only $5 less than what John is willing to pay.  At this point, it's not worth risking another counteroffer and potentially losing out on the sale. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a good profit."
