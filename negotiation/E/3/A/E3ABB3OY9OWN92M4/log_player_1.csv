Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 gives Bob the feeling he might get a deal if he negotiates, but it's still very profitable for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $99 might make Bob feel like you're trying to squeeze every dollar out of him, potentially making him walk away. 
* **Secure a Profit Over John's Offer:**  The $90 offer ensures a higher profit than selling to John for $80."
