I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. There are still rounds left to negotiate."

While Bob is offering a price closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push him higher."

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding out for a price above my minimum. With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping this offer will be tempting enough for Bob to accept."

With only two rounds left, I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
