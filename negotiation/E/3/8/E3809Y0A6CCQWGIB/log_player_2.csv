You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price than $11,000 because it's worth $10,000 to Alice.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $11,250 is better than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  However, $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
