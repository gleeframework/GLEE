Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,500,000.  This is a higher price than I'm guaranteed to get from John, but it leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I want to try to earn more than the minimum value I've placed on the product.
* **Strategic pricing:**  $1,500,000 is a significant markup, but not so high that it immediately seems unreasonable. It allows for some negotiation, and Bob may be willing to pay a premium if he values the product highly.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I'm guaranteed to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This means I can afford to take some risk with Bob."
