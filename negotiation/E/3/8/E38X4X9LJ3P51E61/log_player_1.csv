Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $150 offer. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price slightly below John's offer creates the impression of a deal while leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Psychology:** By mentioning a ""special price,"" there's a subtle implication that this offer won't last forever, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
