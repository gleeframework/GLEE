"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $25000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for this product.  It's a fair price given my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15000. It's a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away happy.  I'm hopeful you'll consider this offer.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $17000. This is the next best compromise I can offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $16000, which is a fair price considering our progress.  Let's finalize this deal, I'm ready to buy.",16000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $16500. This is as low as I can go, but I'm still confident it's a great value for you.",16500.0,Alice,7,
