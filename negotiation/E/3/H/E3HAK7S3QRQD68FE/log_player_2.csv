(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's getting closer to your budget. It's worth another counteroffer to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice you're willing to pay more than your initial offer but still below her current offer. It keeps the negotiation moving forward while pushing for a price closer to your target."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above your $800,000 limit.  At this point, it's better to go with the guaranteed price from John. You've already invested some time in negotiations, but risking going higher than your budget isn't worth it."
