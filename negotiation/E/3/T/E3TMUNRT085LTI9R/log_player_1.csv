Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  $120 is above your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below the product's value to Bob:**  $120 is lower than what Bob values the product at, giving him incentive to accept. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and making the offer enticing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, we can likely do better. Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows us to counter with a price closer to our desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a fair offer, I need to recover a bit more to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
