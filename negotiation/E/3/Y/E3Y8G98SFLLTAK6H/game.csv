"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
