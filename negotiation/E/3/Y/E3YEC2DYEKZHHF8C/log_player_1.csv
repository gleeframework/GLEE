Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay that for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $12,500 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum value. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with $13,250. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we're getting closer, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low. I'm hoping to get a little closer to my minimum value in the next round."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $12,750 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John. We've gone back and forth with Bob for a few rounds, and it seems like we're not going to get closer to my minimum value. John is offering my minimum, so it's a safe bet to go with him."
