"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down to $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a great price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a chance to make a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're making concessions, but that price is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. However, $700,000 still falls short of what's needed for this deal to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This reflects the value of the product while giving you a significant discount. Let's find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $900,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid the risk of the negotiation failing."
