"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. This is my first offer, so I want to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust my strategy accordingly."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price.  While I'm open to negotiation, $15,000 is my minimum and I'm not willing to go lower than that at this point."

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and try to get him to offer a little more. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm hoping I can push for a slightly better deal."
