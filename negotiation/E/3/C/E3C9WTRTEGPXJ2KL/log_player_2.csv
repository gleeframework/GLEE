You have three options:

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $110. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 
 
I'm offering $105, which is a fair price for both of us.  It's a good compromise between what I'm willing to pay and what Alice is willing to sell for."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $115 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  It's better to just buy the product from John for $100."
