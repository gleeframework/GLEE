Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly.
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  The offer must be higher than the $100 John is willing to pay to incentivize Bob to buy.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, maximizing profit while still making the offer attractive to him."
