``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that is higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to gauge Bob's interest and get him thinking about the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle for it right away. I want to see if I can get more.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This product is truly unique and worth the investment.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're able to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for more.  It's better to secure the sale now rather than risk ending up with the lower price from John."
