Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $120, but I'm also willing to negotiate. Offering $100 allows for potential room for compromise while still making a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120 and even lower than his own valuation of $80. It's not worth accepting at this point. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $65 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is still above Bob's valuation but below my minimum. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while also keeping my profit in mind."
