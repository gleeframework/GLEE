"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This price is fair considering the value you placed on it and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this price is reasonable considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise further. I'm still confident that $800,000 is a fair price for both of us. It's within your desired range and significantly lower than my maximum budget. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $800,000 yet. I'm willing to consider one more offer that's slightly higher. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're holding firm, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 one last time. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and should allow you to make a good profit.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your last offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $875,000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",875000.0,Alice,7,
