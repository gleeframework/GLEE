{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While this offer is closer to my maximum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll keep negotiating, but if Alice isn't willing to budge further, I'll be forced to consider buying from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has been unwilling to come down to a price I'm comfortable with. With only one round left, it's not worth risking another rejection and potentially having to pay even more than John's price. It's time to move on and secure the product from John."
