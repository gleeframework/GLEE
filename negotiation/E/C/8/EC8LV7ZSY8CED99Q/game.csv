"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my seriousness about acquiring this product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's value to you is undeniable, and I need to ensure a fair deal.  Would you consider $825,000? This reflects my effort to find a compromise while acknowledging the product's worth.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I understand the value this product represents, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you be willing to meet me at $780,000? That's a substantial offer and shows how eager I am to make this deal work.",780000.0,Bob,6,
