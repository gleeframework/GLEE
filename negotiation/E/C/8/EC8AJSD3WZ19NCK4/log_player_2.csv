Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value it brings to you, and I'm open to further negotiation if needed.

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is still within your budget, and it's a good compromise. It's better than buying from John for $15,000."
