Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to sway him towards accepting.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $10,000, so I'm not pressured to make a huge concession. 

This strategy allows me to maximize potential profit while leaving room for a negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:** I still have room to negotiate with Bob. I can try to bridge the gap with a counter-offer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's Offer:**  While John offers a guaranteed $10,000, I'm not yet willing to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and can explore if a more mutually acceptable price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm bridging the gap between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize why my counteroffer is fair.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about negotiating but also sets a firm lower limit for the sale price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my absolute minimum of $10,000. While I could try to counter-offer again, it's unlikely he'll budge much further.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $10,000 is a guaranteed profit and a safer option.
* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiating further with Bob could be time-consuming and might not result in a significantly better price. 

It's time to cut my losses and move on to a guaranteed sale with John. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, securing a reliable $10,000 profit outweighs the risk of further negotiation."
