"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $7,500, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our conversation,  $7,500 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to reflect your budget and my desire to make this deal work. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is too low for me. I'm not willing to go lower than $8,000.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  It's a fair price for both of us."
