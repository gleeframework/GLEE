"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll really value.  I'm willing to part with it for $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $100. 
* **This is a good deal for you.** You get the product for less than your maximum value, saving $20."
