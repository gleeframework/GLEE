"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $150 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you at a special introductory price of $135. This is an excellent opportunity to acquire a high-quality item at a reasonable discount. I believe you won't be disappointed with this investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Alice is trying to inflate the perceived value of the product to you. While $135 is less than your $150 maximum, you can likely get a better deal.  You should see if Alice will come down further or be prepared to buy from John."
