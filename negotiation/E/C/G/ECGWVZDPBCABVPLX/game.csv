"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,900,000 is far beyond my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of the product.  What are your thoughts?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while your offer is getting closer, $1,700,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value we've both discussed.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
