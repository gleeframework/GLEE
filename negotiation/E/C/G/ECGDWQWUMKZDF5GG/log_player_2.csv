Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? "", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit too high at $1,050,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,025,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.  This is a final offer, so let's get this done.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice seems firm on $1,050,000. While she might come down slightly, it's unlikely she'll reach $1,000,000. Cutting my losses and going with John guarantees the best price."
