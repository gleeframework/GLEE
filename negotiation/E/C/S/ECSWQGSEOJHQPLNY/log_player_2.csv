"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,050,000, but I'm afraid it's still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the value I believe the product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for more negotiation. I'm not comfortable paying over $1,100,000. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  I'm still looking to stay within my budget and am willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to reach my minimum price to make this deal worthwhile. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for more than I'm comfortable with, and it seems like further negotiation won't get us closer to a price I'm happy with.  At this point, it's better to go with John's offer and secure the product for a price I can afford."
