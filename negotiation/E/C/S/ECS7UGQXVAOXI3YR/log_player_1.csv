Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it will bring to you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000) and your minimum acceptable price ($800,000), we aim high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high price.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. This allows you to potentially meet in the middle while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer. 

**Important:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response."
