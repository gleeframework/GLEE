Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves Bob feeling like he might get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to accept it at this time. It's lower than what I can reasonably accept for the product. Let's try $1,600,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $1,400,000 is still below what I can reasonably accept for this product. To demonstrate my willingness to make this deal work, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not quite there. I've made several concessions and I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm also worried that we might not be able to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. To avoid potentially losing out on a guaranteed sale, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
