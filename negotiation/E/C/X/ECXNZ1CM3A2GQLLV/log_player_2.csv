"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal than $900,000. Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's potential to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is still above Alice's minimum selling price ($800,000) but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($900,000). This shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within Bob's budget and is a better price than what he could get from John.  While there's still room for negotiation, it's not worth risking a higher price or the possibility of Alice rejecting further counteroffers.  Accepting this offer secures the product for a reasonable price."
