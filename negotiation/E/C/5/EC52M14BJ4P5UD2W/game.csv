"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about we meet at $10,500?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  How about we meet at $10,200?  This is a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's still fair considering the value of this product. What do you say?",10200.0,Alice,5,
