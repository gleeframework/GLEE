"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for a good deal for Bob.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent offer, I'm not ready to settle for it just yet. I'm aiming for a higher price, and I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable number with a little more negotiation. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $10,000. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not completely satisfied. I believe there's room for a higher price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating for a little longer. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a better middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still a significant discount from my initial price. It shows that I'm willing to be flexible and come to a compromise, but I'm not willing to settle for a price too far below what I believe the product is worth. Let's see how Bob responds to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to sell for that price. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm confident we can still find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,750. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise given the negotiations so far. I believe we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to sell for anything less than $9,750."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than $9,000.  I'm willing to try one more counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I believe that $9,000 is a fair price, considering the negotiations so far. I'm confident that we can reach a deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum, but I've already rejected several offers close to this price.  I don't want to risk another round of negotiation and potentially end up with nothing.  I'll take the guaranteed $8,000 from John and move on."
