It's always good to try and negotiate, especially with a price that low.  Let's see if we can get it even lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount. This should signal my serious interest while leaving room for negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm raising my offer slightly, but still below Alice's latest price. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also keeps pressure on her to meet me halfway."

We're getting closer, but I still think we can squeeze out a bit more.  Let's counter again and see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000}

I'm increasing my offer by a small amount, showing willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a better price.  This might be our last chance to get it below $937,500 before we risk losing the deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We're getting very close to my maximum, and Alice seems firm on this price.  Accepting the offer is the best option to avoid the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
