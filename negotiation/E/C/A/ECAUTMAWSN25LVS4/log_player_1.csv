Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $100 provides leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price."
