Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider $1,300,000. This offer reflects a willingness to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest, I can't go as low as $1,150,000. My final offer is $1,250,000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000.  You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so it's more advantageous to do that."
