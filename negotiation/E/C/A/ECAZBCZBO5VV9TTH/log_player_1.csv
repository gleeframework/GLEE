"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion, hoping to build rapport.
* **Asking for Feedback:**  Asking Bob what he thinks invites him to counteroffer and helps gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I'm very interested, but I can only pay $8000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  There's room for negotiation, and I'm not in a rush to close the deal.
* **Exploring Value:** I want to understand if Bob is truly willing to pay more than $8,000.  By rejecting his offer, I can potentially push for a higher price.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John gives me some leverage to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is just a bit too low for me right now.  How about $9,000?  That's still a good deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Middle Ground:** I'm  moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm phrasing the counteroffer in a way that encourages further discussion and potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's quality and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $8500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with it. 
* **Potential for Higher:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore if I can get even closer to my desired price.
* **Staying Patient:** I'm not in a rush to close the deal, especially since I have a guaranteed backup offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I'm getting closer to where we need to be. Let's split the difference. How about $8,750?  It's a fair price for a great product."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This demonstrates willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fair price"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and equity.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  I'm staying persistent in my negotiation while acknowledging Bob's position. This maintains the momentum and avoids giving the impression that I'm willing to accept his previous offer."
