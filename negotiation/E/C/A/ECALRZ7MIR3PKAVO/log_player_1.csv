Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so this is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  This doesn't mean he'll pay that much, but it gives you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high initially, but not so high that Bob immediately walks away. There's a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the unique benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Opening:** Starting at $950,000 gives you room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Justification:** Vaguely mentioning ""value and potential""  attempts to justify the high price without revealing too much about your bottom line.
* **Confident Tone:**  Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal"" can make the offer seem more appealing.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Key:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting or moving on to John.
* **Don't Reveal John's Offer:**  Keep John as your backup plan. Revealing him weakens your negotiating position."
