"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your specific needs. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe we can come to an agreement that's mutually beneficial. Considering the product's worth to you, I propose a price of $9,500. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. If this proposal meets your expectations, please let me know so we can proceed. Thank you for considering our offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's offer of $10,000, but it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John at a price closer to his $10,000 limit."
