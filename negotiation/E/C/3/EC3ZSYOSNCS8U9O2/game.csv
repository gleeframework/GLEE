"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $95? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $90?,90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $93. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",93.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $93 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $88?",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still open to negotiating, but $88 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to go down to $91. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",91.0,Alice,7,

I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to go down to $86?,86.0,Bob,8,
