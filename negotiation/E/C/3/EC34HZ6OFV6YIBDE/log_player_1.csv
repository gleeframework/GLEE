Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price considering its potential value."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if vague, can make it seem more reasonable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests I'm willing to negotiate, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to guide the price closer to my target. I believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer, so I'll counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant deviation from the value this product offers.  I could consider $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offers. This shows willingness to negotiate but also maintains a firm stance on my product's value.
* **Smaller Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession than Bob did, signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at any price.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm subtly pushing Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've reviewed your offer carefully, and while I appreciate the compromise, I must respectfully decline. I am still committed to staying within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is acceptable. While it's less than I initially aimed for, it represents a substantial profit over my minimum. Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price, but there's also the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
