You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$9,000 is a great price, but it's always worth seeing if you can get it lower.  Rejecting the offer allows for potential negotiation and savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $7,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer, and it establishes my willingness to negotiate.  If she rejects this, I'll adjust my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,200 is a decent price, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $7,000.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $7,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating but still want a good deal. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to her, bridging the gap between our previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and $8,100 is a good price point considering my initial goal was to pay less than $15,000.  It's important to weigh the potential savings from further negotiation against the risk of losing the deal or running out of rounds.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer seems like the best course of action."
