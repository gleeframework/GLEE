"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000. I think it's a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. I'd be willing to pay that for the product.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, how about $8,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,250. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,250 is still not quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference this time? I'm willing to come down to $7,875.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",7875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,875 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $7,500, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price.",7500.0,Bob,6,
