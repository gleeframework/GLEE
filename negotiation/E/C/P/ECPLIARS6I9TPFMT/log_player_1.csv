{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000. I think it's a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better price.  I'll be ready to negotiate further if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. I'd be willing to pay that for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, how about $8,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,250. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,250 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get a better deal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,250 is still not quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference this time? I'm willing to come down to $7,875.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,875 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $7,500, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although $7,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal from John.  Since John is willing to pay the $8,000 that I need to make this worthwhile,  I'm going to sell the product to John."
