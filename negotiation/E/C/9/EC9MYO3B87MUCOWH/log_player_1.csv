Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. This product will bring you a massive return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving closer to our desired price, but we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for a price above $1,100,000 and have time before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting close.  I understand your budget constraints but let's split the difference. How about $1,150,000? This reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer, but I'm trying to be mindful of my spending.  Would you consider $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and has steadily increased his offer. While we could potentially squeeze a bit more, accepting $1,125,000 secures a substantial profit over our minimum and avoids the risk of pushing Bob away in further rounds."
