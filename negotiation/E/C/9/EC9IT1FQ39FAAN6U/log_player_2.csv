Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price from Alice. Even though John's offer is only $500 higher, it's a good baseline to ensure Bob doesn't end up paying more than necessary."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now equal to John's.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, there's no benefit to continuing negotiations with Alice.  At this point, buying from John is the optimal choice, as Bob can be sure of getting the product for his maximum acceptable price."
