Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below our minimum ($120). Offering it at $119 leaves some room for negotiation while still aiming high.
* **Create Urgency:**  By setting a firm price and implying it's a great deal, we encourage Bob to act quickly before he potentially misses out.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale with John at $120, so there's no risk of being left with the product if Bob declines."
