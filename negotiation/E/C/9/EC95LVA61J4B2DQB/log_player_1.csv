Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

This allows for some room for negotiation, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's potential.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
