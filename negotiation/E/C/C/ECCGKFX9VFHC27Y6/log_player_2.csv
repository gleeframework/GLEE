"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $150. 
* You have the option to counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* There's no need to rush into buying from John yet, as you have 10 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $165?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $165 is still above your budget, but getting closer.
* It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get the price down to $150 or slightly above. 
*  You still have rounds remaining, so you can keep trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $165 is still a bit high for me.  How about $155?  I'm really interested in the product, and this is the highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 155}
