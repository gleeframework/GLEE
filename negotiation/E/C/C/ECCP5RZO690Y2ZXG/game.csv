"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to purchase the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $9,000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a little outside my target range. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750?  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",8750.0,Bob,4,
