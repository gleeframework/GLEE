Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're trying to meet me halfway.  However, $97.5 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $102.5, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below $100. At this point, it's more strategic to take John's offer.  You've gained information about Alice's potential bottom line, but cutting your losses and securing the product for $100 is the best move to maximize savings."
