Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might result in a quicker sale and still yield a profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but still leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a reasonable deal. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is straightforward and highlights the offered price without being overly aggressive. 
 
This approach balances the certainty of selling to John with the potential of making a higher profit from Bob."
