"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000). This allows for room to negotiate and still potentially get a good deal.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob. This creates a sense of urgency and motivates him to consider my offer seriously.
* **Open-Ended:** I'm leaving the message open-ended to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, but it's still a bit lower than I'd like. Since we have more rounds left, I'm going to try to push for a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $18,000 is a good starting point, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $19,000? Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer to show I'm listening and engaging in the negotiation.
* **Counter-Proposal:** I propose a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a positive tone and emphasize making the deal happen. This keeps the conversation constructive and encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but $19000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $18500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $18,500 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
