Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close now, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you at $125. That's my final offer, let me know if it works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down in price, but she is unlikely to go below her latest offer of $125. Since you have the option to buy the product from John for $120, it makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
