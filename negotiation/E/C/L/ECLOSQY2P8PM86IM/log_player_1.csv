Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay below $1,050,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with the price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  It's also worth noting that John is still waiting in the wings, offering a guaranteed $1,000,000.  I'm going to see if I can get Bob up to $1,000,000 before considering that option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $1,000,000. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $980,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay below $1,000,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. It's a close call, and Bob is getting closer to my target price, but I've reached my limit with the negotiations.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is my minimum price. There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next counteroffer, and I'm not comfortable risking the deal falling through with only 4 rounds remaining."
