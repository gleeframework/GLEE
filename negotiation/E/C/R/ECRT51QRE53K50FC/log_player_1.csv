"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1250000. This price is fair considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price. Selling to John now would be less profitable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1350000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to offer $1300000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's a good deal for me, especially considering we're only halfway through the negotiation process. There's a good chance that Bob might reject my counteroffers in the next rounds, and I might end up selling to John for $1,200,000.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most profitable decision at this point."
