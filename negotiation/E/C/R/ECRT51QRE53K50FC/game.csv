"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1250000. This price is fair considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1350000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1350000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to offer $1300000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
