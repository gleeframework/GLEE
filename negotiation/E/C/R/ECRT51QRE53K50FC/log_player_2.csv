"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's below your maximum, it's in your best interest to try and negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This price is fair considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1350000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $1,350,000 is still higher than what you're comfortable with. You have several rounds left, so continuing to negotiate is the best strategy. You can try to push for a lower price while still being within your budget."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
