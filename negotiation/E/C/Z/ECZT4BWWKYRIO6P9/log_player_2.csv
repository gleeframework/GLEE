"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
Let's negotiate to see if we can get a better price from Alice before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility.  This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $1,000,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $850,000 is unfortunately too far below what I'm able to accept.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This gives you a great price while still allowing me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

Alice meeting us in the middle at $1,025,000 is a reasonable deal. It's below our maximum budget and saves us a significant amount compared to John's offer."
