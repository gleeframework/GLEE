"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for more room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet. I believe I can get a better deal from Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price and a good deal considering how the negotiation has gone. I'll accept his offer to avoid further rounds and the risk of him backing out."
