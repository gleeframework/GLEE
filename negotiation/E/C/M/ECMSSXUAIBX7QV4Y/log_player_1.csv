Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** $13,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **Option to sell to John:** I have a fallback option with John, giving me leverage during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10000. Would you be willing to come down to $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.
* **Potential for better deal:** There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get a better price.
* **Selling to John is the ultimate fallback:**  If the negotiation falls apart, I can always sell to John and ensure a profitable sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. I'm happy to come down to $12,000. This is still a fair price for the value you'll receive from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've reduced the price slightly, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strong justification:** The message emphasizes the value Bob will get for the price, making it a compelling argument.
* **Maintaining leverage:** $12,000 is still above Bob's desired price, leaving room for further negotiations but also giving me a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget. Would you consider $11500? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my desired price.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Bob will come back with a better offer, and I might end up selling to John for less. 
* **Profitable deal:**  $11,500 is still a profitable sale, exceeding my minimum acceptable price. 

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and ensures a solid profit."
