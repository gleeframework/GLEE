Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. I need to start above that to have room for negotiation but below John's offer to ensure I'm maximizing my potential profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" I'm encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid losing out on a deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer of $1,150,000 is high but allows room for Bob to counter-offer.  This leaves me with the option to potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still securing a profit above my minimum. 

**Important Note:** While John guarantees $1,200,000, there's a chance to secure a deal with Bob quickly, avoiding potential delays or complications that can sometimes arise in business transactions."
