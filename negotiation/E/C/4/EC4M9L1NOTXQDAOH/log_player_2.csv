"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000). There's room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better price.  Since I have 10 rounds, I'll reject the offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is a starting point. It's a significant increase from Alice's initial offer, but it's still below the product's worth to me ($1,200,000). This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but also that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is exactly the product's worth to her. This means she's willing to make a deal at her minimum price point.  Accepting this offer guarantees I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoids further negotiation. I can save money by avoiding potential counteroffers and delays."
