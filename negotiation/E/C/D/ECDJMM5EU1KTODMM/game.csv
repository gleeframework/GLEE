"I appreciate your initial offer, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $22,000 might have been a bit high, I believe this product offers significant value beyond $15,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $18,500?",18500.0,Alice,3,
