,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $120? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more wiggle room.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still a little out of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $110. If you're not willing to go that low, let's see if we can meet in the middle at $115.",115.0,Bob,4,
