"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9,000 for the product. Can we discuss a price between $9,000 and $12,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the last round. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but that's as low as I can go. Can we meet at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I can appreciate your need to cover your costs.  How about we settle this right now at $8,000?  That way you can avoid any more back and forth, and I get a fair price.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession by offering $8,500. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $8,500. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",8500.0,Alice,7,
