Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9,000 for the product. Can we discuss a price between $9,000 and $12,000?

We're still too far from my target price. We have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the last round. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but that's as low as I can go. Can we meet at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but we're now only $500 away from John's offer.  It's worth one more counter-offer to see if we can get closer to $8,000 before accepting John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I can appreciate your need to cover your costs.  How about we settle this right now at $8,000?  That way you can avoid any more back and forth, and I get a fair price."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession by offering $8,500. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $8,500. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice seems firm at $8,500, and while that's not a terrible price, we know John will sell it for $8,000. It's time to cut our losses and go with John's offer."
