"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate. This price is a good starting point, as it's roughly half of her initial offer and still within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is exactly at my maximum budget.  While I'd prefer to pay less,  it's unlikely I'll be able to get a lower price from Alice.  Buying from John would be the same cost, and I'm not sure if he would be open to negotiation either.  It makes sense to accept this offer."
