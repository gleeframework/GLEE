# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
