Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. We have room to negotiate and time is not a critical factor yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I need to be firm on this.  The product's value is non-negotiable below $1,150,000. This is my final offer."",

While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, we're still leaving a significant amount on the table. Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to our acceptable range. Let's see if we can push him a bit further in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, taking anything less than $1,100,000 would be selling this product short. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

```

Bob is not showing a willingness to meet near the product's value.  It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his offer would mean a loss of $225,000 compared to John's offer. It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
