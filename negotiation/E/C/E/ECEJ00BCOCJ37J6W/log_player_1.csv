"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, which is slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate and allows for a potential compromise. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm letting Bob know I'm open to hearing his thoughts, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Value:**  My message highlights the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high and showing flexibility, I hope to initiate a negotiation where Bob might propose a counteroffer closer to my desired price. If he rejects my initial offer, I'll have rounds to adjust my price and secure a better deal. However, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $100, ensuring a minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is simply too low.  

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll use this opportunity to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.  I'm also mindful of the option to sell to John for $100, which serves as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $60 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by moving down from my initial offer, but I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a win-win, aiming to emphasize a fair deal for both of us. 

**Strategy:**

By making a reasonable counteroffer, I hope to encourage Bob to negotiate further. I'm confident that $90 is a fair price that both parties can agree on. If he rejects, I'll have more rounds to adjust my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $90 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $70.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $70 is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the product's value to me. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that's more in line with my minimum acceptable price. The option to sell to John for $100 is a valuable safety net if negotiations don't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. While $70 doesn't work for me, I'm willing to compromise further. How about $85?  This is a significant price reduction and still ensures a fair return for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by continuing to decrease my price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting the Reduction:**  I'm emphasizing the significant price reduction to appeal to Bob's desire for a good deal. 
* **Fair Return:**  I'm emphasizing the need for a fair return for myself, subtly reinforcing my minimum acceptable price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, but also offers Bob a significant discount.  This counteroffer balances my need for a profit with the need to reach an agreement. If this offer is rejected, I have the option to sell to John for $100, guaranteeing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $75 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm committed to getting at least $100 for the product, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  With only a few rounds remaining, I need to find a solution that works for both of us. I'll consider making a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $75 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers â€“ how about $80? This would allow us to reach a fair agreement, and I'm sure you'd agree that this product is worth every penny.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a middle ground between our last offers.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and suggesting that $80 is a fair price. 
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing this as a potential final offer to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

$80 is my last offer before considering selling to John. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and provides a reasonable profit for me. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $100, ensuring a sale."
