Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $150 offers a potential $30 profit margin without being so high that it immediately scares Bob away.
* **Open Communication:**  The message is friendly and leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to discuss the price further."
