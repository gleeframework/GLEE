{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit above my minimum value of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $120 is my minimum value, I'd prefer to earn more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

```

Bob's offer of $110 is too low for me.  It's below my minimum value, and I'm confident I can get at least $120 from John."
