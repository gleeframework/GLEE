"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $14,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm only able to go up to $12,000 at this point. Let me know if you're willing to work with that."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial proposal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best option.  You can get the product for $13,000, which is still below your maximum price of $15,000 and better than John's price.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your offer again and you'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price."
