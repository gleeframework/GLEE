"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. Can you consider my new counteroffer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
