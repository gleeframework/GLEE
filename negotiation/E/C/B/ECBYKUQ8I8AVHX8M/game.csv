"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. ",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway at $850,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $900,000. My next offer is $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am ready to buy today if the price is right. How about $780,000?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $810,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",810000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I feel like we're dancing around the same numbers.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How about $795,000 and we close this deal?",795000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, but I'm still not convinced that $795,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $815,000. This is the last time I'm willing to budge, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",815000.0,Alice,9,
