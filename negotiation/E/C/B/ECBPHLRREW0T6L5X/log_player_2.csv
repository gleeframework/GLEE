You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial asking price, it's still more than your target of $800,000.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price from Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice $750,000. This is significantly lower than her initial offer and my maximum budget, but still within a range where she might be willing to negotiate. It's important to start with a strong counteroffer to see if she's serious about selling."

Alice's offer is now within my budget and a better deal than buying from John. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might reject again or walk away. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price."
