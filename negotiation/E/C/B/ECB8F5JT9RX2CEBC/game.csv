"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm asking for $13,000 to start. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking something closer to $6,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you be interested in $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  $9,500 is still a little steep for me. Could you consider $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  I could be persuaded to go down to $8,750, but that's as low as I can go.",8750.0,Alice,5,
