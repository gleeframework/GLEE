We can likely get a better price than $1,000,000.  Alice is eager to sell and starting with a discount indicates room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're working with a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is holding firm at $1,000,000. However, her willingness to negotiate suggests she might go lower. We'll continue to push a bit further before considering John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll offer you the product for $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

This is a good deal for us. Alice is firm on this being her final offer, and $950,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price. Accepting now avoids the risk of missing out on the deal altogether."
