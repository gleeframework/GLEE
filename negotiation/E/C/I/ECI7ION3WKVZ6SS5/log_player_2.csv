"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $900,000 is significantly more than the product's worth to you ($1,500,000). 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's a large gap between your desired price and Alice's offer.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John:**  While John offers a higher price, rejecting Alice's offer doesn't preclude you from buying from John in the future. You can explore negotiating with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $600,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** While $600,000 is likely too low for Alice to accept immediately, it leaves ample room for negotiation and compromise.  
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see how far she's willing to go to sell the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While slightly lower than her previous offer, $950,000 remains outside my budget.
* **Continued negotiation potential:** I still have room to negotiate. Rejecting this offer allows me to counteroffer again and continue working towards a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Risk of John's price:** Buying from John at $1,500,000 is a last resort. I want to explore all options with Alice before resorting to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** I'm increasing my offer to $700,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a significant gap between our desired prices.
* **Finding a Compromise:**  $700,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This is a more realistic price that could be acceptable to both of us.
* **Avoiding John's Price:**  While John's offer is still on the table, I'm determined to see if I can reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Alice before resorting to that price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too close to John's price:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still too high, nearing John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation stalemate:** Alice seems unwilling to go lower, and further counteroffers might not lead to a significant price reduction.
* **Minimizing risk:** To avoid potential further negotiation with Alice that might not yield better results, it's better to secure the product from John. Even though John's price is higher, it guarantees I get the product at a known price and avoids the risk of further negotiation failures."
