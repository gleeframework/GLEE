"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I understand it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price that works for both parties.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Even though Alice's price is higher than her value ($800,000), it's still cheaper than John's price ($1,000,000).
* **You're getting a good deal.**  You value the product at $1,000,000, and you're getting it for $900,000. This means you're saving $100,000."
