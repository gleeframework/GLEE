"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer at this point, as you can get the same price from John. It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good discount right away.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, she has some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is willing to come down a bit, but there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get her closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
``` 

I'm going to split the difference between my last offer and Alice's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise, but still aims for a price closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my desired price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a chance she'll refuse to budge further and I'll end up having to buy from John. At this point, it's safer to accept and save $700."
