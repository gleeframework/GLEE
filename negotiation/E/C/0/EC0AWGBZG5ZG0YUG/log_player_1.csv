"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but not drastically so. This gives me room to negotiate while still maintaining a high starting point.
* **Focus on value:** My message emphasizes the value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm leaving room for counteroffers,  but I'm aiming to close the deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than his perceived value. I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this point.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and potentially get closer to my target. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,550,000? This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him and reiterating that my offer is still beneficial.
* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still above his initial price. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position. 
* **Moving toward a deal:** By moving toward a middle ground, I hope to encourage Bob to reconsider and potentially lead to a deal in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1550000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $1300000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $1,300,000 is still significantly below what I'm hoping for. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to close the gap further with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,450,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising further:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above his last offer.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to justify my price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to come to an agreement.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm positioning my counteroffer as fair and mutually beneficial.

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward and potentially lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1450000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $1250000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, $1,250,000 is still far below my desired price and even lower than his perceived value. I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I still have 4 rounds left to negotiate and I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low. I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1,400,000 is my final offer.  This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. If you reject this offer, I'll need to consider selling to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm stating that this is my final offer, adding a sense of urgency and potentially motivating Bob to accept.
* **Meeting halfway:**  While it's not exactly halfway, this emphasizes my willingness to compromise further.
* **Threat of selling to John:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the alternative, making him aware that he might lose out if he doesn't accept.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly suggesting he'd be making a good deal.

This counteroffer is my best attempt to close the deal with Bob while maintaining a price close to my target. It's a calculated risk, but I'm hoping the combination of factors will push Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $1400000. I'm willing to pay $1200000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my desired price and even lower than his perceived value. With only two rounds left, it's highly unlikely I can negotiate a better price.  I've reached a point where the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob outweighs the potential benefit of continuing negotiations.  John is willing to pay my minimum asking price of $1,500,000, ensuring I achieve my target."
