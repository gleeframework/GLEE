"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still a little higher than my maximum budget of $150. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a good price, but I'm really looking to stay under $100 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay under $100, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, so I can offer you a slight discount. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$110 is still too high for me.  I'm going to try to negotiate further, but I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably spend.  Would you consider $105?  This would give you a good profit, and it would be a much better price for me."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already given you a significant discount from the original price. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $108, which is within my budget and only slightly above my ideal price of $100.  I'm not sure I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate, and I'm running out of rounds.  This is a good deal, so I'm going to accept it."
