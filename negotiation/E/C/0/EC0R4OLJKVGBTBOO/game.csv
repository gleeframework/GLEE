"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a good price, but I'm really looking to stay under $100 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider $95? ",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay under $100, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, so I can offer you a slight discount. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably spend.  Would you consider $105?  This would give you a good profit, and it would be a much better price for me.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already given you a significant discount from the original price. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",108.0,Alice,5,
