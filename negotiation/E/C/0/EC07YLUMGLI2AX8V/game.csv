"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $115 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $120? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
