"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'd be willing to sell it to you for $9250. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9250 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
