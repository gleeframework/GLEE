Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000.  I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000 vs. $8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, I've maximized my profit. If he negotiates, it indicates he's interested but wants a better deal.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm secure knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John. This allows me to be more assertive in my negotiation with Bob."
