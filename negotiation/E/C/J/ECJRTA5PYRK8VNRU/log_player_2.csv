**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,200 is still within Bob's budget of $10,000 and is closer to his desired price than John's offer. It's a good compromise, and accepting it saves Bob $800 compared to buying from John."
