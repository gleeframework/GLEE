{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $100 but below my minimum of $150, leaving room for negotiation.  It also sets a positive tone for the interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it is significantly below my minimum valuation of $150. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, considering your interest in the product.  Let me know if you're able to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I cannot go above $100 for the product. Would it be possible for us to meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his price, and I am not comfortable selling the product for $100.  It's better for me to sell to John for $150, even though it's less than I initially hoped for."
