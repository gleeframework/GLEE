"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down to $14,000. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. Would you be willing to accept $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $13,800. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",13800.0,Alice,3,
