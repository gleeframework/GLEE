"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000. This is a significant opportunity, as I'm confident it's worth far more than that. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10000.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to pressure Bob into accepting the offer by claiming it's worth more than $15,000 and that another buyer is willing to pay $10,000. However, this information is not verifiable.  Bob knows he can get the same product from John for $15,000, so there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  By rejecting, Bob maintains his maximum budget and doesn't risk overpaying."
