"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm more in the market for something around $1,100,000. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,300,000? It's still a great price for you, considering its worth to you. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the value of this product for you. How about $1,250,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
