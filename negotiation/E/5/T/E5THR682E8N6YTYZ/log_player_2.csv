Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,300,000? It's still a great price for you, considering its worth to you. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the value of this product for you. How about $1,250,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a good price considering your $1,500,000 maximum and saves you a significant amount compared to John's offer."
