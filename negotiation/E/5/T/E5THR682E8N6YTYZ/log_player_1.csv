Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm more in the market for something around $1,100,000. What do you say?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my desired minimum, and I believe I can secure a better price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,300,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
