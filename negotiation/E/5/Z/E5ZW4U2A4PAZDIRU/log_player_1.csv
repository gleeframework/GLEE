"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate and also shows that I believe in the value of my product.  I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by starting with a friendly message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe I can make a fair deal for both of us. Would you consider selling the product for $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $160 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm confident in the value of my product and want to see if I can push for a higher price.  

I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $170.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm sticking with a price higher than $160, but I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price. I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $165. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $165 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I've already lowered my price twice, and I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work. I'm willing to go down to $168. That's a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 168}
```

I'm  reducing my price by a smaller amount this time,  demonstrating I'm getting closer to accepting a deal.  By emphasizing it's a ""significant concession"" I'm hoping to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts, Alice. Considering the value of the product, how about we aim for $166? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $166. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $166
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get $168, $166 is still a good price and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. It's likely that Bob won't budge much further, and I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether."
