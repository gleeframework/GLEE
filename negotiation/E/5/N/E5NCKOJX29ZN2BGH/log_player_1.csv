"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my desired value.  It's important to remember that I have a safety net with John's offer of $1,500,000, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm rejecting it and will try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum, but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility. I'm hoping this price is more appealing to Bob while still being advantageous for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is very close to my minimum value of $1,500,000, and I'm running out of time.  It's likely that we won't get much closer in price, so accepting this offer is the most practical choice."
