"Hey Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only do $115 right now. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. I can't go that low, but I'm willing to come down to $125. That's a fair price for both of us, I believe.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",120.0,Bob,4,
