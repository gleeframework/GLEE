"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it would be a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $950,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than the $1,200,000 you would pay to John.  This represents a substantial savings for you, even though it's still more than what the product is worth to Alice.  It's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer."
