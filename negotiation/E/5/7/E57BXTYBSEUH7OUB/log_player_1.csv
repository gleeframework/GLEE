This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price point that's higher than your minimum but leaves room for potential bargaining. It also includes a friendly message to establish rapport and build trust."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I am only able to offer $14000 for it. I hope this is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $14,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming to maximize my earnings. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle."

Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum, and considering he's shown willingness to negotiate, I'll accept his offer. It's a good deal for me and avoids the risk of losing out completely."
