Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. That's the price I'm willing to pay for it.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. I really need to stick to my budget.

You have three options:

While Bob is somewhat interested, he's unlikely to budge much from his $95 offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to continue haggling with Bob and risk getting even less."
