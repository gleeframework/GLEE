"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than Alice's initial value of $120, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to his $80 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob starts with a counteroffer that's a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  $90 is halfway between Alice's initial price and Bob's maximum budget, making it a reasonable starting point.
* **Message:** The message conveys a willingness to negotiate while also emphasizing Bob's budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price.  Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and there's still room for Alice to come down further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a price closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Bob increases his offer by a smaller amount this time ($5), demonstrating a willingness to compromise but still staying within his budget.
* **Focus on Middle Ground:** The message emphasizes finding a ""middle ground"" to encourage Alice to be more flexible.
* **Closing the Deal:** The message subtly implies a desire to close the deal, hoping to push Alice towards acceptance."
