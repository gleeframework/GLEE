Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $140, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but not too high.  This gives me some room to negotiate, while also showing I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell it for less than what it's worth to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting closer, Alice!  How about we split the difference and do $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, $112 is still above my minimum threshold of $120.  It's a good compromise, and I'd rather close the deal with Bob than risk losing him and having to sell to John for less."
