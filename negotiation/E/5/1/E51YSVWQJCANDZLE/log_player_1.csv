Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects a fair value considering my needs and the market.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're passionate about this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1,150,000 is still too steep for me.  How about $950,000? This would allow us both to reach a fair compromise.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit above my ideal range, but I'm ready to make a final offer.  $975,000 is the absolute maximum I can go.  Let's close this deal.

You have three options:

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer, it's unlikely he'll bridge the remaining gap quickly enough to be worthwhile.  Taking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John makes the most financial sense at this point."
