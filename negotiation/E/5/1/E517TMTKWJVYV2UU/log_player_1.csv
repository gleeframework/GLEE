"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while still ensuring I get a decent profit. It's important to remember that I have a backup option with John, so I don't need to settle for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $17,000. It's still a significant profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm happy with.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob. I still have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to stick with my backup option, John, for now.  I'm going to offer $15,000 to Bob, which is my absolute minimum.  If he rejects, I can immediately sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
