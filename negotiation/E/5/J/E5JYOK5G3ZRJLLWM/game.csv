"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but it's still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet halfway between our last two offers at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit higher than your target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $8,200. This is the next lowest price I can accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",8200.0,Alice,5,
