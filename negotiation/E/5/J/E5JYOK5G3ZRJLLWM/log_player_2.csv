"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining and gives Alice the opportunity to meet you somewhere in the middle. 
* **Significant Difference:** The initial offer was substantially higher than your limit. A lower counter-offer signals that you're serious but also expecting a more reasonable price.
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive and interested tone encourages Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice has come down significantly, her offer is still above your maximum price and John's offer. We can try negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but it's still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet halfway between our last two offers at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 7500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price exactly halfway between the previous offers, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate fairly and move towards a mutually agreeable deal. 
* **Justification:**  Offering a reason for your counter-offer (""a little more than I'm comfortable with"") helps Alice understand your perspective.
* **Positive Language:** Continuing to use positive language (""appreciate,"" ""fair compromise"") keeps the negotiation amicable and encourages Alice to stay engaged."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 is still a bit higher than your target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $8,200. This is the next lowest price I can accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but her latest offer of $8,200 is still higher than John's guaranteed offer of $8,000.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice when you have a better option readily available."
