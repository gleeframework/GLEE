Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value our negotiation, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the product's value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,150,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and leaves room for a win-win outcome.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's unlikely to go below John's offer of $1,200,000.  At this point, it's better to secure the product from John at the known price and avoid further negotiation."
