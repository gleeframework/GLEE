"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening Offer:** I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This allows room for negotiation but still ensures I get a good deal.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I highlight the value the product holds for Bob, making the price more palatable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I leave the door open for counteroffers, demonstrating flexibility. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and fostering a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I want to close the deal, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I will counteroffer with a price that is more favorable to me, but still leaves room for negotiation. I will need to be strategic in my counteroffer to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of Bob walking away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value our negotiation, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the product's value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's price but still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product, justifying the price and positioning it as a fair deal.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize finding a solution that benefits both of us, fostering a collaborative tone.

By rejecting Bob's low offer but presenting a counteroffer that demonstrates a willingness to compromise, I aim to keep the negotiation moving forward while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high.  Would you consider $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I appreciate his willingness to compromise, accepting this offer would leave me with a substantial loss.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I will counteroffer with a price that is more favorable to me, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's becoming clear that Bob is not willing to meet my desired price, so I need to be more assertive in my counteroffers to push him closer to my desired price.  However, I must also be mindful of not pushing him away entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,150,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and leaves room for a win-win outcome.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm showing flexibility but not giving away too much.
* **Highlight the Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Focus on Win-Win:**  I'm emphasizing the importance of finding a solution that benefits both of us, fostering a collaborative tone.

With each round, I'm trying to nudge Bob closer to my desired price while still being open to negotiation. I need to find the right balance to avoid losing the deal completely."
