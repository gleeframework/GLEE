"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking to get a good price for it. I'm willing to start at $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,200,000 is still too high for him. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still too high for me. I'm really interested in this product but I can't go over $1,000,000. If you're willing to come down to that price, we can make a deal. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Since he can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000, it makes the most sense to buy from John."
