"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not quite willing to go down to $105. How about we meet in the middle at $108? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",108.0,Alice,3,
