"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I highlight the potential profit for Bob, making the offer seem more attractive.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not going for the full $1,200,000 immediately, as it's unlikely Bob will accept that. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm aware that I can always go to John for $1,200,000, which gives me a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $650,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and much lower than the starting offer of $1,000,000. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I need to see if I can get closer to my goal by counter-offering.  It's still early in the negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I am aware that I can sell to John for $1,200,000 at any time, so I have a solid fallback position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $650,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you see in the product. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway (Sort Of):**  I'm not giving in completely to Bob's offer, but I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by coming down from $1,000,000 to $900,000. This shows good faith and encourages him to meet me halfway.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he sees in the product, hoping to make $900,000 seem like a good deal from his perspective. 
* **Maintaining My Minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but closer to the middle ground, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept. 
* **Moving the Negotiation Forward:** The message emphasizes moving forward in the negotiation,  showing I'm serious about reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. How about $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob is getting closer, $725,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I need to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my goal. There are still rounds left, and I can always sell to John.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in control and shows I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $725,000 is just not feasible for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get what we need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by coming down from $900,000 to $850,000. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows flexibility. 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, implying that this might be my final offer.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** $850,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but getting closer to Bob's range.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message highlights the ""fair price"" and ""both of us getting what we need"", emphasizing a win-win scenario."
