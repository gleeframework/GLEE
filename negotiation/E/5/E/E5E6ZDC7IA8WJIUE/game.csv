"Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, considering its worth to you. Please let me know your thoughts. If this isn't the right fit, I have another buyer lined up.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
