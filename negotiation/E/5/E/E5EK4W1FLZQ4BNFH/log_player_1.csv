"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for my budget, though. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects the value this product will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value this brings, but I have a pretty firm budget. I can do $700,000. This offer is a significant investment on my part and would be a great opportunity for us to do business together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below our minimum and even further below our initial ask. We need to signal that we're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss.  We'll continue counter-offering strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued interest and understanding of the product's value. To move this forward, I can come down to $900,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're lowering our price in $75,000 increments now, signaling a willingness to negotiate, but we're holding firm closer to our minimum. By stating it's our best offer, we're hoping Bob understands the seriousness of the negotiation and the value he's getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, that price is still a bit high for me.  To meet you halfway, I can offer $750,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob calling this his ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic. While he is increasing his offer, $750,000 is still significantly less than our minimum.  We are willing to risk losing the deal to see if we can get closer to $850,000, which would be a reasonable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from on the price.  While $900,000 is my best offer, I'm willing to consider a slight adjustment to close this deal today.  Can you meet me at $850,000?"", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're acknowledging his ""final offer"" but countering with a strong stance at $850,000. By framing it as a way to ""close the deal today,"" we're adding a sense of urgency and opportunity for Bob to get a slightly better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement on price. To be frank, I have another offer for $800,000. If you're willing to match that, I'll close the deal with you today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now at his maximum perceived value for the product. While we'd prefer to get closer to our initial asks,  accepting $800,000 is a profitable outcome. Holding out for more might push Bob away, risking the entire deal."
