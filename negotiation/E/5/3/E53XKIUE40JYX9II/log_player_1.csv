{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Setting the price at $925,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($200,000) between Bob's valuation and your minimum. 

This strategy balances:

* **Greed:** Aiming for a high price close to Bob's maximum.
* **Risk Aversion:**  Not going too high and risking Bob rejecting the offer, forcing you to sell to John for less."
