"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for less than $120 from Alice, and potentially even lower than $100. There's room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend less, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $125. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer again.  He wants to spend less than $112.50 and there's still room for Alice to come down a bit.  He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still aiming to stay below $110.  How about $108? That's still a good deal for you, and it's close to my budget."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay below $110, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. How about we try $115? It's a bit higher than your offer, but it's still a good compromise. I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his goal, it's still higher than he wants to pay. He can likely continue to negotiate and get the price down further. He should make another counteroffer, trying to stay under $110."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still hoping to stay below $110.  Would you consider $109?  It's just a small step closer to my target, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 109}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting, Bob, but I still think I can get a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is the best price he's been offered so far, and it's within his budget.  While he might be able to get it slightly lower, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John $150."
