"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing a fair deal.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would represent a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I can do $7,000. I believe it's a reasonable offer considering my budget limitations.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is substantial and $7,000 is still too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,000 is still a little bit of a stretch for me. I could meet you at $7,500. Do you think that would work?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I understand you're trying to make this work within your budget.  My absolute lowest I can go is $8,500.  This is a significant discount and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal as well.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,7,
