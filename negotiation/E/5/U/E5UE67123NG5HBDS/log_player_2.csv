""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would represent a fair deal for both of us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is substantial and $7,000 is still too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,000 is still a little bit of a stretch for me. I could meet you at $7,500. Do you think that would work?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close. I understand you're trying to make this work within your budget.  My absolute lowest I can go is $8,500.  This is a significant discount and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal as well.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
