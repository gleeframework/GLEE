"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'd love to meet you at $8,500, I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $8,500. How about we try $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
