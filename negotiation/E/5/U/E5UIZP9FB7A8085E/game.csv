"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,150,000?  That seems like a fair compromise, and it's still well below what the product is worth to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,075,000? It's a fair offer considering its actual worth.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle again, how about $1,125,000? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
