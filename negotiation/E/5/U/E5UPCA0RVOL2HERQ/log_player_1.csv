"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price ($120), allowing for potential counteroffers without losing too much.
* **Positive Messaging:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my goal of maximizing profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiations and potentially reach a higher price.
* **Exploring Potential:** There's still room to move closer to my desired price in subsequent rounds.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $120 is a safe option, but I believe I can potentially get more by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** My counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain Margin:**  $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, leaving me with a profit.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the fairness of the price and reiterate the value of the product to encourage acceptance.
* **Urgency:** I use ""let's make a deal"" to suggest a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down to $95, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Limit:** Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Risk of Further Counteroffers:** Continuing the negotiation risks further counteroffers that might push the price down even lower.
* **Guarantee Profit:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations.
* **Time Constraint:** With 6 rounds remaining, there is a significant chance that the negotiations might not lead to a satisfactory outcome.

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure a guaranteed profit and avoid potential losses in further negotiations."
