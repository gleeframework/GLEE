"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,650,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,525,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
