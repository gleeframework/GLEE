Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $100 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $95, which is still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while keeping the price above my minimum."
