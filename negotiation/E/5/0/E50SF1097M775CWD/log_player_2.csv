"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $115. It's a steal!  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay a maximum of $120 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $115, which is still more than your maximum price.
* Although it's a good deal compared to John's offer, it's still above your budget.
* You can reject Alice's offer and still buy the product from John for $120, which is your maximum price."
