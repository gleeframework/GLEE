"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $12,500 is a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers at $12,750. Can you consider my revised offer?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,750 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit higher.  Would you consider $13,000? It's a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this product.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to the product's value, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,900, which is just $100 more than my initial offer. Can you consider my revised offer?",12900.0,Bob,6,
