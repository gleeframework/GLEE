"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a fair price considering its worth to you.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. That's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $165. It's still a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll pay $157.50.  That's a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy.",157.5,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go below $160. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $160. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",160.0,Alice,5,
