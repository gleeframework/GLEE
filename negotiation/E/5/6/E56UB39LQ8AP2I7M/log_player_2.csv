"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less than $14,000 by continuing to negotiate with Alice. He knows Alice is willing to sell for at least $12,000, so there is room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $13,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget perfectly."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $13,500, he's getting a good deal and saving $1,500 compared to buying from John. While there might be a chance to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer or him losing the product to another buyer is too high. This offer is a good compromise."
