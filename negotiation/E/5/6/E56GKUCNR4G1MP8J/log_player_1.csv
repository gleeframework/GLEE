Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get as close to my ideal price as possible. I'll be willing to negotiate down, but I'm confident that Bob is interested enough in the product to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still not ideal. I'm going to try to get closer to $100 by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway with a price of $95. I'm hopeful he'll accept this counteroffer, as it's closer to his ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $92.5 is getting closer to my minimum price, and I'm willing to settle for that amount rather than risk further negotiation or selling to John for $100."
