,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is my maximum offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understanding that this product has significant value. While your initial offer is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to work with you. To show that, I'll come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I need you to understand that $1,200,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Bob,6,
