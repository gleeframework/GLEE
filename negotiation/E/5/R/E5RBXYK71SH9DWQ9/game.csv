This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit more, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $925000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
