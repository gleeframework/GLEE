Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential ROI to justify the high price. 
* **Urgency (Subtle):** The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiating style, you might need to adjust your approach in further interactions."
