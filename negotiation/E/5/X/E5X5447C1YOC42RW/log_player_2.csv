Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,100,000, so I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and has moved closer to my ideal price point.  Waiting any longer and trying to push for a lower price may push her away, and $1,150,000 is a reasonable price for me."
