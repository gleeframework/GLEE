"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think that price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we try to find a compromise around $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,100,000, so I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
