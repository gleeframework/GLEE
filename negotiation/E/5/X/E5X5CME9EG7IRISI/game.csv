"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $775,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $775,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be open to considering $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,
