"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to make a good deal. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
