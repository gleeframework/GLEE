Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,237,500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm not going to break the bank. I'll counter with $1,220,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000

}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to $1,237,500, Bob's counteroffer of $1,220,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than my fallback option of selling to John, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result.  It's time to close the deal."
