Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than his perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $12,000 through counteroffers if needed, but I'm also open to ending the negotiation and selling to John if Bob isn't willing to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I believe I can get a better price through further negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than his counteroffer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is still below my desired value, it's getting closer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for a higher price.  The potential of a long negotiation with no guaranteed outcome, coupled with the certainty of the $12,000 deal with John, leads me to accept Bob's offer."
