Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $9,500 is a price he might be willing to pay.
* **Is lower than your minimum value:**  You want at least $10,000, so this offer gives you room to negotiate if Bob rejects.
* **Shows willingness to compromise:** It shows you're open to negotiation, which is important for building trust.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,800 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired minimum of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,200. This is a fair price that still allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum desired price, $8,900 is still below my ideal value. I'm willing to take another round to see if I can get closer to $9,200 or even higher."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your persistence.  $8,900 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,050?  This way, we both get a good deal and we can close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9050}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,050 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider this price?

```

It seems like Bob is unwilling to budge much further. While I could continue negotiating with him, the risk of going back and forth without getting closer to my desired price is high. It's best for me to move on and sell the product to John for $10,000.  This way, I can ensure I get my minimum desired value and avoid wasting time with a stubborn buyer."
