"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering your own valuation and the potential value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and the value you've expressed it has to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $762,500 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us. ",762500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $762,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $800,000. This is my minimum price, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value I place on the product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
