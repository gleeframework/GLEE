"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $10,000? I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is tempting, it's a bit lower than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product well worth it. ",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now. How about $10,500? It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy with a fair deal. ",10500.0,Bob,4,
