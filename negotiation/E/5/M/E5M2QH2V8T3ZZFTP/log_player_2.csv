"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Bob ($15,000). 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate, and there's room for Alice to lower her price further. 
* **Counteroffering is the best strategy:**  Bob should try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $10,000? I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic:**  Bob is starting with a significant drop in price, but it's still above Alice's minimum value.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  The message emphasizes finding an agreement that works for both parties.
* **Opening for negotiation:**  Bob's message leaves room for Alice to counter with a higher price, keeping the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is tempting, it's a bit lower than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product well worth it.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above Bob's target:** $11,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price range.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  Alice has already moved closer to Bob's offer, indicating she's willing to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting and counteroffering, Bob can potentially get a better price.  He's not in a rush and has time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now. How about $10,500? It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy with a fair deal. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant move:**  Bob is offering a smaller reduction, showing he's serious about a deal while leaving room for Alice to counter.
* **Framing as a compromise:** Highlighting the ""good compromise"" aspect emphasizes a win-win scenario for both.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  The message stays friendly and avoids pushing Alice away with aggressive tactics."
