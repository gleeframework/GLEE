"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $110, so I'll offer it to you for $107.50. That's the best I can do.",107.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $107.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",105.0,Bob,6,
