Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,900,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could continue negotiating, Bob has stated this is his final offer. Accepting $1,900,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,500,000) and a fair deal at this point. Continuing the negotiation risks losing Bob altogether and having to settle for John's offer."
