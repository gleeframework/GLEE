"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,800,000 is certainly appealing, the value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000.  I believe this price point reflects the immense potential of this product. What do you say?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,950,000. Can you consider this price?",1950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I appreciate you finding a middle ground.  How about we settle at $2,025,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",2025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,900,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
