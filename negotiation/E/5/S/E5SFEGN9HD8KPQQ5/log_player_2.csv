"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $140 for it. This offer takes into account both the cost of production and the significant value this product holds for you, as you've mentioned it's worth $150 to you. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $140 is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price. Rejecting her offer might lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer. You can always fall back on buying from John for $150 if necessary."
