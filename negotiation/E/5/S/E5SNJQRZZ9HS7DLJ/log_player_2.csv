"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This represents a significant saving for you and a fair price for me, considering my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This price reflects the product's true value while still offering you a substantial discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price and John's offer.  Bob can continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his $1,100,000 counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,225,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  This would be a good compromise and allow us both to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price, and I respect that.  However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $1,150,000. My final offer is $1,180,000. This is a very competitive price, and I need to finalize this deal soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has made her final offer at $1,180,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as it is lower than Alice's initial offer and only slightly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  Bob can save $20,000 compared to buying from John. It's likely that further negotiation will not result in a significantly better price.  Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
