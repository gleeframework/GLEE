"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $600,000. I understand that's a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and it's a great opportunity for you to secure a deal. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle at $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a compromise, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",850000.0,Alice,5,
