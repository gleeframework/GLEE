Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a fair offer considering the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250

**Reasoning:**

While $7,250 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired amount. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to $8,500."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $8,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 8000}
