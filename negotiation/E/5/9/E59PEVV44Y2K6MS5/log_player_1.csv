{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than Bob's $8,000 value, giving him some incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  $9,500 is still above your minimum of $10,000, meaning you'll still make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still negotiate lower if necessary, giving you some flexibility.

This initial offer sets a good tone for the negotiation, allowing you to potentially secure a higher price while keeping the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget of $8,000. While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to meet you halfway. This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
