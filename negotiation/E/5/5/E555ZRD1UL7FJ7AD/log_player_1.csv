Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate if he wants to.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you some room to lower the price if necessary. 
* **It's a fair starting point:**  It's not overly aggressive, and gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $88? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $88 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems unlikely I'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  John is already offering my desired price, so I'll sell the product to him to ensure I get my desired profit."
