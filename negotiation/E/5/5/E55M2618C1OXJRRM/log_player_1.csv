Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.

While Bob is moving towards my price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a number I'm happy with. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
