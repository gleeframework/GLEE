,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $140. Can you meet me at $135? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to pay.",135.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $142 is still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $137? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.",137.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the product's minimum value for me. I can offer you the product for $138, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.",138.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about your minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $137, but if you're not willing to go any lower, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $120. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price I'm comfortable with.",137.0,Bob,10,
