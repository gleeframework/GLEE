"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm proposing to sell it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1800000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your offer, but still reflects the product's value. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1200000 is still a bit high for me. My absolute maximum is $1000000.  If you can't come down to that price, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price that's really close to your maximum, but still reflects the product's value. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1050000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
