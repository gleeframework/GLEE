I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1050000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.

Alice's offer is still above your budget.  At this point, it's better to go with John's offer and secure the product at your maximum price. You've already negotiated a good deal, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down further."
