"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my best offer for today. Let me know what you think.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is still below my initial expectations, I'm willing to accept $1,300,000 to close this deal today. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
