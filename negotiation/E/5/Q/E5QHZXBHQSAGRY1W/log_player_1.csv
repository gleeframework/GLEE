Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price slightly higher than that.

{""product_price"": $90}

Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $85. Since this is higher than my minimum price of $80, I'll consider it.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or try to negotiate further. Bob seems to be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum price, but I'm not sure if I can get a better deal.

For now, I'll decide to... Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll send Bob a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $85, I'll try to negotiate a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer.

{""product_price"": $87}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my counteroffer, and now he's made another offer of $82. This is getting interesting!

Since $82 is still higher than my minimum price of $80, I'll consider it. However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or try to negotiate further. Bob seems to be getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not sure if I can get a better deal.

For now, I'll decide to... Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll send Bob a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $82, I'll try to negotiate a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer, but still a bit lower than my original price.

{""product_price"": $84}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my counteroffer, and now he's made another offer of $80. This is getting interesting!

Since $80 is my minimum price, I'm faced with a tough decision. I've already rejected offers of $80 or higher, but now Bob is offering me my minimum price. I could accept this offer and sell the product, or I could try to negotiate further.

However, I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal. I've also considered the option of selling the product to John for $80, which would be a guaranteed sale.

For now, I'll decide to... Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80.
