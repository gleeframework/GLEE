"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better deal than John's offer, Bob can likely get a lower price by counter-offering.  There's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price, but the potential savings make it worth exploring."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to get a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $10,500. While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above Bob's target. There's still potential to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best course of action."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to your target price, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,200, which is still above Bob's target price but closer than John's price of $12,000.  At this point, there is a high chance that Alice won't budge further.  Since Bob doesn't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product at a good price, it's better to accept the offer and save $800 compared to buying from John."
