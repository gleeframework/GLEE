Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves room for you to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's not too aggressive:** This shows you're willing to compromise and avoids immediately pushing Bob away.

I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I'm hoping to keep my expenses within $12,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me. 

I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a fantastic price considering the value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise, but not at a price that significantly undervalues my product.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a win-win situation.
* **Clear Price:**  I'm presenting a specific price to make it clear what I'm asking for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $13,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still lower than my ideal price of $15,000, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower offer from Bob, or I could end up selling to John for $15,000.  However, there's a good chance that the negotiation could drag on, and I might not be able to achieve a higher price. 

Considering the potential for further delays and the fact that Bob's offer is only $2,000 below my minimum, I've decided to accept his offer.  It's a good deal, and it allows me to finalize the sale without any further negotiation."
