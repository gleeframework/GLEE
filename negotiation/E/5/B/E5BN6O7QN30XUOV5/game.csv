"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $165. I think it's a fair price considering the product's quality and value.",165.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're willing to make a final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $155. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $165 to $155, which would be $160. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",160.0,Alice,5,
