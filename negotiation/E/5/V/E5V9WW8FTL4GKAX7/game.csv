"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle ground and offer $12,000. I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. I think this is a fair price that takes into account the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
