"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $975,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while being reasonable. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in my previous offer. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Alice is signaling this is her final offer and while you could potentially negotiate a little lower, the time and effort might not be worth the potential savings.  You're getting the product for $75,000 less than your backup option."
