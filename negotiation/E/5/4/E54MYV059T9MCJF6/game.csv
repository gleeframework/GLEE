"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects the product's value while still giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $9,500 is still a bit lower than where I need to be, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. I think this price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to avoid selling to someone else at a higher price. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,200? I'm really close to my limit, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I can afford the product.",9200.0,Bob,6,
