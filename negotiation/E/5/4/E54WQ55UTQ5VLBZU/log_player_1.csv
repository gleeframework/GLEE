Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, since we have a guaranteed sale at that price from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 allows for the possibility of Bob countering with a slightly lower price, still leaving you with a profit.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $120 might discourage Bob immediately. A slightly lower price makes it seem like there's room for a deal. 

**Important Note:** While John guarantees $120, there's always a chance another buyer could offer even more. However, in this scenario, we're optimizing for the information we have."
