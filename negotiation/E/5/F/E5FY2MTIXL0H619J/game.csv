"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $120?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $120.  Would you consider $145? That's my final offer.",145.0,Alice,5,
