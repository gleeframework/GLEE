"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a steal! I think you'll find it's a great deal at $145. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you're willing to pay. You have a better alternative lined up with John."
