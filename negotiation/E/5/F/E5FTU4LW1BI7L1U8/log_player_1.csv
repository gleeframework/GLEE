{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit while still leaving room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value of the product to Bob.  I'm confident Bob will want to purchase the product at a price below his valuation, but above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is more than my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's also a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
