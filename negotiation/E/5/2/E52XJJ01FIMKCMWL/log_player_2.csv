"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($1,500,000). I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a better price.  It's also worth noting that buying from John is my absolute worst-case scenario, so I want to exhaust all options with Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your initial price, I'm not quite ready to commit at this point. Considering the value of this product to me, I'd be willing to offer $1,350,000. This represents a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:** My counteroffer is significantly higher than Alice's initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable price:**  $1,350,000 is still below my maximum budget and represents a reasonable starting point for the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** By not offering my absolute maximum, I allow for potential future concessions and a more dynamic negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'd like to make a counter-counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly the product's worth to her.  This means I'm getting a good deal and saving $300,000 compared to buying from John.  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially forcing me to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
