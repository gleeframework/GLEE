"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this unique item. However, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10000. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",10000.0,Bob,4,
