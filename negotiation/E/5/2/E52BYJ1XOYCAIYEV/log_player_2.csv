**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's room for both of you to find a price that works."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $10,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $12,000. This is a bold move, but it shows that I'm serious about getting a good deal. It's likely Alice will counter-offer, but it sets the stage for a negotiation where we can both potentially find a mutually agreeable price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good deal for me. It's lower than my initial counteroffer and significantly lower than John's price. Accepting this offer allows me to save money and secure the product without further negotiation."
