The product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay. How about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

Alice is willing to meet halfway, but that's still more than I'm willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer gives me another chance to negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I've thought it over and I'm willing to meet you at $132.50. I'm making a concession, but I still need to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5

Alice's offer of $132.50 is the best deal I've been offered so far. It's a good price for me, and I don't want to risk losing the product and having to buy it from John for $150."
