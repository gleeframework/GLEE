"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay. How about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I've thought it over and I'm willing to meet you at $132.50. I'm making a concession, but I still need to make a profit. What do you think?",132.5,Alice,5,
