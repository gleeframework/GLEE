"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe is worth more than $1,200,000 to you. My initial offer for this exceptional item is $1,400,000. I understand the value this product holds for you and I am confident it will exceed your expectations. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any questions. I look forward to the possibility of working with you on this exciting acquisition. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is better than John's offer of $1,500,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with her or explore other options. There's a chance Alice might lower her price to make the deal."
