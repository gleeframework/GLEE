"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000,  which still allows for a good profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a good profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our previous offers.  Let's make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still not close enough to what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a significant concession, and I hope you'll see it as a sign of my commitment to making this deal work.  Let's try to find common ground.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
