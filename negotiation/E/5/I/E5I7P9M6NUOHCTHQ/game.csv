"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise at $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",10000.0,Alice,5,
