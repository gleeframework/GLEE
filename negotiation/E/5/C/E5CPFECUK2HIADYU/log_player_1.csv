Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's latest offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aim for a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's latest offer is only $25,000 lower than my previous counteroffer. At this point, it's getting close to the price I'd accept from John.  It's more beneficial to finalize the deal with Bob and secure the sale."
