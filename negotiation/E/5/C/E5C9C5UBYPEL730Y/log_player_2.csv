{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  Alice is unwilling to go lower than $9,000, which is still more than Bob wants to pay.
* **John's offer is a known quantity:** Bob knows exactly how much John is willing to sell the product for. There's no risk of further negotiation.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice could take more time and might not result in a significantly better price.

While $12,000 is higher than Bob's ideal price, it's still within his budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Alice."
