"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a good deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,
