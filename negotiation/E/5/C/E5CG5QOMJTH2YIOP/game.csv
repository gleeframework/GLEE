"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential and my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your budget considerations, the value this product brings justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's potential.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
