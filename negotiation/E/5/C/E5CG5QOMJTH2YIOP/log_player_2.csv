"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above Bob's maximum budget. It's highly unlikely Alice will come down to Bob's desired price range quickly, so it makes sense to reject and try to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential and my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your budget considerations, the value this product brings justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue trying to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
