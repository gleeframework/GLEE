"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""significant returns"" to justify the high price without explicitly revealing my own valuation or Bob's potential profit margin. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first round is about gauging Bob's reaction. His response will indicate his interest level and provide valuable information for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value but still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 provides a safety net. I'm not willing to accept anything below that at this stage. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can propose a counteroffer that moves the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your budget considerations, the value this product brings justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's potential."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I've made a considerable reduction from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming well above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Focusing on Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value proposition, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits and justifying the higher price. 
* **Testing Bob's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to move significantly from his initial offer.  His response will indicate how much further I might need to adjust my approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Risks of Continued Negotiation:** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the negotiations could drag on, reducing my overall profit (considering the time value of money).
* **Securing a Good Deal:** Accepting this offer represents a significant profit and avoids the uncertainties of further negotiation."
