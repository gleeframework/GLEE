# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still confident that it's worth more than $1000000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get the price down a bit further by making another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1020000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,020,000, which is just $20,000 more than your desired price of $1,000,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice is firm on this price. Accepting this offer is the best option to save money as it's still considerably less than buying from John."
