"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? This gives us both room to negotiate and ensures a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your new offer and my initial counteroffer. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
