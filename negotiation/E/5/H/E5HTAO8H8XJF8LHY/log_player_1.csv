Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This gives me a good chance of earning more than I would from John, while still being a potentially attractive price for Bob.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Higher than John's offer:**  $1,500,000 is significantly more than John's offer of $1,000,000, meaning I have a potential to earn more.
* **Unknown value to Bob:** I don't know Bob's perception of the product's value. Offering a price higher than my minimum might incentivize him to buy, especially if he believes it's worth more.
* **Potential for negotiation:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always lower the price slightly and offer it to him again.  

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit."
