"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This will give me a good starting point and see how eager Bob is to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still aiming for a price above Bob's initial offer. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, especially considering his previous rejection. It also gives him some room to counter if he's still not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a significant loss compared to selling to John. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob before I accept his offer or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm offering $1,450,000.  This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's the best chance to reach an agreement with Bob before I have to settle for John's offer.  This price is still a bit above his last offer, but closer to what I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low for my liking, and we're running out of rounds.  Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price for the product, even though it's not my ideal outcome."
