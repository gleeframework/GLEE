"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you showing me the product. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be open to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12,500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $12,500 is still pushing my budget.  How about we settle at $11,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. How about we meet at $12,250? It's a small step up from your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",12250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, I'm afraid my absolute limit is $11,750. If that's not doable for you, I understand, but I wouldn't be able to go any higher.",11750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, let's do it.",12000.0,Alice,9,
