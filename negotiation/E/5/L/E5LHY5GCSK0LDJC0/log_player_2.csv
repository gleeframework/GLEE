"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $6,000 is a good price, but you can likely do better.  You have 10 rounds and you're not under pressure to buy from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
``` 

You're starting with a counteroffer of $5,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still a reasonable price for a product you value at $8,000.  This should give you some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer. It's higher than your initial counteroffer, but it's still $500 less than your maximum value and you still have several rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
``` 

You are increasing your offer slightly, but still keeping it below your max value. This shows that you are willing to negotiate but still have a firm price in mind. You are getting closer to Alice's offer and hopefully pushing her towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to your max value, you still have a few rounds left to try and negotiate a better price. It's risky to accept this early, and you might be able to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

You are again increasing your offer, but you are still keeping it below your maximum value. You are getting closer to Alice's offer, and this counteroffer could be enough to convince her to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer.  You are now within $500 of your max value. With 3 rounds remaining, there is still time to see if you can get Alice to come down a bit more.  You've been steadily increasing your offer and showing Alice that you are serious about buying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

You're raising your offer again, but still staying below your max value.  At this point, Alice is showing that she wants to get close to her target price. This might be the best offer you can get from Alice, but you're still a bit away from your max value and you have two more rounds to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is your maximum price. It's the same price John is offering, and you only have one round left.  You're not going to get a better deal from Alice, so you might as well buy from John and save yourself the hassle of negotiating."
