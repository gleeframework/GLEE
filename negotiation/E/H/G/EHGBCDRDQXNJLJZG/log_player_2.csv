"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get the product for $12,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $10,000 is better than John's price, but it's still possible to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $9,000 is a reasonable counteroffer, as it's still a good deal for Alice (better than her $8,000 value) while also saving Bob $1,000 compared to Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what Bob could get from John. There's room for negotiation to get a better price, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. This counteroffer is a bit higher than his previous one, showing willingness to negotiate. It's still a good deal for Alice, and it's closer to Bob's target price. This approach increases the likelihood of Alice accepting the offer while still giving Bob a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to John's price.  However, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a further counteroffer, and the risk of continuing the negotiation is not worth it for Bob.  Buying from John for $12,000 guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget, even if it's not the absolute lowest price."
