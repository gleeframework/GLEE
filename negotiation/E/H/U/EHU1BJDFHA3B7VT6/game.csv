"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $14,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to offer you $10,500 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value to me. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value of $10,000 and the fact that we're both aiming for a win-win situation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm still a bit far from the value I have in mind. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll counteroffer with a price of $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it's still a good deal for you as well.",12500.0,Alice,5,
