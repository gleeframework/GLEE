Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $115, that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is signaling she's firm on her price.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result, and there's always the risk Alice walks away. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable $115 than risk having to pay John's $150 price."
