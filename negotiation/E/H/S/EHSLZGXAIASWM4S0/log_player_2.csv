"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $130. This is a great deal for you, and it would be a significant profit for me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to pay $130."
