"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

You're aiming to save as much as possible. Alice's offer is too high for your target price of $120. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $95. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than Alice's value of $80. This gives Alice room to negotiate while also making it clear that you're serious about a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can work with that. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still higher than you're willing to pay. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating and see if you can push her further down. There are still rounds available to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $105 is closer, I'm still hoping to get the product for $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further compromise, bridging the gap between your previous offer and Alice's latest one. It shows you're committed to finding a solution while still pushing for a price that aligns with your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're really pushing for a good deal, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to meet you at $102.50, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $102.50 is very close to your target price of $100 and well within your budget of $120. Continuing to negotiate might save you a few dollars, but the risk of Alice walking away or you running out of rounds is too high. Accepting this offer is the best option to secure the product within your budget."
