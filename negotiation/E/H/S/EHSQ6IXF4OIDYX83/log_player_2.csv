# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's no reason to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. How about we try $14,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant improvement from her initial offer, it's still above his budget.  He can get the product from John for a much lower price. There's no need to rush into a deal with Alice yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident I can find a similar product for my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be frugal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $13,500 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting to take a deal that's closer to his budget, he can still get a better deal from John.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down further, but ultimately, John's offer is the safest bet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we try $11,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $12,750. That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has come down significantly in price, it's still above Bob's target. John's offer guarantees Bob the product at his maximum price point, and there's no reason to risk further negotiation with Alice when he has a reliable alternative."
