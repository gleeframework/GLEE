(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Since you have 10 rounds, it's worth exploring if you can get closer to your $100 target."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? This is still a good deal for both of us.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Round 5
Alice's offer:

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
