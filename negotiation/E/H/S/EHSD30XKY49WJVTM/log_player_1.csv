"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $15,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open communication:**  I'm inviting Bob to discuss the price. 

This strategy aims to get a good price from Bob while remaining open to negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have more information to adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking for something within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I have 8 rounds remaining, so there's still time to negotiate a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, I'm hoping to get a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum. This will show I'm open to negotiation but also that I'm not willing to sell at a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $13,000?  That's a compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the price as a ""compromise"" that benefits both of us.
* **Appeal to emotion:** I'm using ""happy"" to appeal to Bob's desire for a win-win situation.

**Next Steps:**  If Bob accepts, I'll close the deal. If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate, adjusting my offers based on his responses and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  While I could potentially negotiate a higher price, there's no guarantee of success, and we're already at a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing time and possibly ending up with John's offer of $12,000. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice, securing a decent price for the product with minimal risk."
