"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $11000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12000, and it's a good compromise between our initial offers.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to me.",12500.0,Bob,4,
