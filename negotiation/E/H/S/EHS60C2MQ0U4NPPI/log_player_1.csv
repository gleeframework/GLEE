Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal and highlighting potential benefits to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message shows I'm open to a conversation and willing to potentially compromise.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can reach a mutually agreeable price before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. While $90 is better than nothing, I can still do better.
* **Negotiation:** Bob's offer is a good starting point for further negotiation.  I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **John as leverage:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $120 gives me more leverage in this negotiation.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore counteroffers and potentially reach a higher price without losing out on the $120 sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a good offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to $100. How about we split the difference at $95?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (sort of):**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and be flexible.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $95 is a fair deal for both of us. This appeals to Bob's sense of reason and makes him more likely to accept.
* **Staying above my minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'm not losing out on any profit. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be agreeable to Bob and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $92. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** $92 is very close to my initial counteroffer of $95 and only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **Time factor:**  Prolonging the negotiation with Bob could waste time, and I might end up with a lower price or worse, no sale at all.

Considering the factors above, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision. It ensures a sale and gets me close to my goal, without risking a potential loss by continuing to negotiate."
