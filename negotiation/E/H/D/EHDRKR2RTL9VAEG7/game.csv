"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we go with $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a little too low for me.  Let's try $112.50. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think we can find a better price. How about $108?",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we may not be able to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $110, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go down to $110, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll meet you halfway between $108 and $110, so how about $109?",109.0,Bob,8,
