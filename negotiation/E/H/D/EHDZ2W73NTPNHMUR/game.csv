"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $800,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $875,000 is still too low.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $912,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to finalize this deal. ",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we should try to find a fair compromise.  While $912,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $890,000. What do you think about meeting there?",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $890,000 is closer to where I want to be. How about $901,250? It's a small step from your offer, and we can finally close this deal.",901250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'd be willing to settle at $895,000.  That's a fair offer considering we're so close to an agreement.",895000.0,Bob,8,
