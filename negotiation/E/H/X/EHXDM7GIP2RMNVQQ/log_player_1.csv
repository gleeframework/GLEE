Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident that after reviewing its features and benefits, you'll find this a worthwhile investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $1,000,000 is far beyond what I'm able to pay at this time.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it, which is a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, however, the value of this product is truly exceptional and in high demand. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth you'll gain from this product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below John's offer, and we have room to negotiate. Bob increasing his offer suggests there's potential to reach a price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  While I value finding common ground, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to accept $875,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise and a strategic investment on your end."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer to a deal, but $875,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $825,000 for the product. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in making this transaction work. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is now exceeding John's offer of $800,000. While we could try to push for more, it's a strong offer, and there's always the risk Bob could lower his price in subsequent rounds. It's a good business decision to accept a profitable offer on the table."
