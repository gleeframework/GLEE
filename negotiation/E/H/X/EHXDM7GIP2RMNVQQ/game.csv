"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident that after reviewing its features and benefits, you'll find this a worthwhile investment.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $1,000,000 is far beyond what I'm able to pay at this time.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it, which is a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach a deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, however, the value of this product is truly exceptional and in high demand. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth you'll gain from this product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  While I value finding common ground, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to accept $875,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise and a strategic investment on your end.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer to a deal, but $875,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $825,000 for the product. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in making this transaction work. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",825000.0,Bob,6,
