Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the potential value I see in the product. Let's see if we can work something out.
