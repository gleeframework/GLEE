Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your budget constraints. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as that.
