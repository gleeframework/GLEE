"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the potential value I see in the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your budget constraints. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1200000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget constraints, but still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
