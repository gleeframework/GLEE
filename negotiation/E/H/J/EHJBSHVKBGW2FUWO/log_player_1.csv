Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm confident I can get more than my minimum of $800,000, as I know the product is worth more than that to me.  I'm also aware that I can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000, so I'm not afraid to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. It's also a good middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $920,000 is a good price, significantly higher than my minimum of $800,000 and only slightly lower than my last counteroffer.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
