Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This item would be valuable to me, but I have a limit.  How about we start the conversation at $500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $500,000 is quite a ways off from where we need to be. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,200,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product represents value, but I have budget constraints.  $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  Could you consider $750,000?  I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested but trying to lowball. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it's worth countering aggressively to gauge Bob's flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I assure you this product is worth every penny. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,000,000? That's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're now at the point where we match John's offer. This is a strong tactic to see if Bob is willing to budge significantly or if he's firmly capped at a lower price point. By presenting it as a ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and importance."
