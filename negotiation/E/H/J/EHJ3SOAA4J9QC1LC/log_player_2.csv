""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This item would be valuable to me, but I have a limit.  How about we start the conversation at $500,000?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $500,000 is quite a ways off from where we need to be. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I assure you this product is worth every penny. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,000,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to her absolute lowest price (her value for the product). There's no room for further negotiation with her, and John is offering the same price. It makes no sense to continue negotiating or risk losing the deal."
