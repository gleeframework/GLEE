"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm initially offering it at $18,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is far too high.  As Bob, your goal is to save as much money as possible.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the product is worth significantly more than that to me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm firm on my offer of $11,000.  Let's see if we can agree on a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
