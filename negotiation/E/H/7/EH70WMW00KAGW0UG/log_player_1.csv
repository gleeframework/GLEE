Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9,000.  Would you consider $8,800 as a compromise? This is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 8800}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $8,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8,600. Would you be willing to compromise at this price?

While $8,600 is closer to my desired price, it's still quite a bit lower than what I would like to get. I'm going to try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand we're getting closer, but $8,600 is still below my minimum.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but $8,700 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8,650. Would you be willing to compromise at this price?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,650 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price.  I have a few rounds left, and I think I can still get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

Round 8

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a better price from Bob, I've reached a point where the potential gain from further negotiation is not worth the risk.  It's important to remember that time is a factor, and John's offer guarantees me a significant profit."
