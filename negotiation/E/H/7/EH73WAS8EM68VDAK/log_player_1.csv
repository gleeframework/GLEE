{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a bit below my minimum selling price, giving me some flexibility. I'll see what Bob says and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum selling price of $120.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price.  I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great deal for a product that's worth $120 to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
