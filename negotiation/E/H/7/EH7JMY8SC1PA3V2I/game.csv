"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's split the difference - how about $100? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,
