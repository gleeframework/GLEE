**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer and seems unwilling to budge to a price that's reasonable for you.  You've hit your maximum price, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better deal.  It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed offer from John at $800,000."
