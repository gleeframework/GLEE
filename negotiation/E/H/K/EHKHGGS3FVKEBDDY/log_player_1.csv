Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below our minimum ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 creates the perception of a deal and a slight loss for Alice while still being a profitable outcome. This makes it more likely for Bob to accept.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit than selling to John directly."
