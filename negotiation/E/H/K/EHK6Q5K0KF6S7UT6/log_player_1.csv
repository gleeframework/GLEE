"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal. I'm also starting the conversation with a friendly greeting and expressing my belief that the product is valuable to Bob, to build rapport and create a positive atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my starting offer and what I believe the product is worth. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $100? It's still a great price for the product, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering $100, which is closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also reiterating that I'm willing to be flexible and that this price still represents a good deal for both of us. This is a compromise strategy, aiming to find a middle ground and signal my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. How about $95? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $95 is still less than my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and only $5 away from Bob's initial counteroffer.  It's also worth noting that we are in round 4 and time is ticking. Accepting the offer minimizes risk and ensures a sale without having to go through further rounds of negotiation.  The potential of Bob rejecting further offers and forcing a lower price, or ultimately choosing to not buy, is not worth risking over the relatively small difference in price."
