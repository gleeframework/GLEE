"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is a decent price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. Bob has room to negotiate and can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in this product, but $90 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $92. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to drop her price much.  Bob's goal is to save money, and $92 is still too high. He can likely get a lower price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay under $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $88?  I think we can both walk away happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $91. It's a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has dropped her price from $92 to $91. While Bob would prefer a lower price, he needs to consider that:

* **The deal is getting closer:** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Time is a factor:** The longer the negotiation goes on, the more likely Bob is to just buy from John for $120.
* **The product is worth $80 to Alice:** Bob can likely get the price down further, but he needs to decide if the potential savings are worth the risk of a longer negotiation.

At this point, accepting the $91 offer is a good balance of getting a decent price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal or ending up paying more to John."
