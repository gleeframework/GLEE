"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above his maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice in the middle while staying within his budget. He's offering a price that's a significant step down from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,800 is getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He has the option of buying from John for $10,000, so he's not in a desperate situation to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,800, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm willing to pay $10,600 for the product.  It's my final offer, as I'm happy to go with John's offer for $10,000 if this doesn't work out for us."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing his luck by offering just $200 more than John's price. This strategy is risky, as Alice might reject it, but it's a good gamble.  He's making it clear that he's serious about the $10,600 price and has an alternative option if Alice won't budge. This creates a sense of urgency and pressure for Alice to accept the offer."
