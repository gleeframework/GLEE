Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer the product at $150 (its worth to John), there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price, earning us more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $135 is a price point that's:
    * Above Bob's perceived value ($120), giving us room to negotiate if needed.
    * Below John's offer ($150), ensuring we still get a good deal if Bob declines. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the ""special price"" to make the offer more enticing to Bob.

This approach balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential for maximizing our earnings."
