"Alice, thanks for your offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $1,100,000 for it to make sense for me.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your offer. Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product for $1,250,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial price and gives you a good deal.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit off.  Would you consider $1,150,000? I feel like that's a fair compromise and would allow us to close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue working towards a deal. While $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm offering the product for $1,200,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,175,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway to ensure we close this deal. I'm offering the product for $1,187,500. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best we can do. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1187500.0,Alice,7,
