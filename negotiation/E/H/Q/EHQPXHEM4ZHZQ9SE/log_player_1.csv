Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He'll only accept an offer equal to or less than this amount.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to get as close to $1,499,999 as possible without Bob rejecting the offer. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer slightly below Bob's maximum value. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's worth.
2. **Justification:**  While optional, you could vaguely imply strong interest from other buyers to create a sense of urgency.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and the significant interest I've received, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 is a strong opening, giving you negotiating room.
* **Subtle Urgency:** The phrase ""significant interest I've received"" implies competition without revealing John's guaranteed offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording implies flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic.  Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and his willingness to negotiate."
