"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from Alice, and even if he can't, he still has the option of buying from John for $12,000. Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives Bob the best chance of getting the lowest price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $10,500, which is significantly lower than John's price of $12,000.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away and he'll be stuck paying John's higher price.  $10,500 is a good deal for Bob and saves him money compared to John."
