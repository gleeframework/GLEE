Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you have room to start high. This allows for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product without being too specific. This leaves room for Bob to justify the high price in his own mind.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, signaling that you're willing to negotiate if needed. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy is based on maximizing profit. If your priority is a quick and guaranteed sale, offering a price closer to $1,000,000 would be more suitable.
* Consider Bob's personality and negotiation style. If he's known to be a tough negotiator, a slightly lower initial price might be more effective."
