Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $900,000? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.

# Alice's message: I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product, Bob, but $750,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $850,000? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. Let's see if we can make a deal.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $850,000. Since you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes more financial sense to take John's offer and save the $50,000."
