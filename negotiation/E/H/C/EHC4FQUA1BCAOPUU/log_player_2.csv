Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're a tough negotiator!  I'm willing to come down slightly to $8,250. I think that's a very fair offer and reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very unlikely to come down significantly from her $8,250 offer, and we have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000.  There's no point in risking a higher price by continuing the negotiation."
