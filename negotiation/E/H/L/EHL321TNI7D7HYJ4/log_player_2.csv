"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I'm confident it'll be a great asset for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject and counteroffer to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend less than $1,400,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly less than what John is selling for and still gives Alice a profit.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price and avoid potentially going back and forth with Alice further."
