Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth while also providing you with significant value."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible while staying above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Strong but Fair Language:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as mutually beneficial.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If I knew Bob was a tough negotiator, I might start higher to create more bargaining space.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If there was a time crunch or I had reason to believe Bob might have other offers, I might be more aggressive with my initial price. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
