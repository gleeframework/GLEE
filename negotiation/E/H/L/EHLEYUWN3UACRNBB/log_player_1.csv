Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which is a steal for its value."", ""product_price"": 200}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $140 is still quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get.  How about we meet halfway between $140 and my previous offer of $200? Would $170 work for you?"", ""product_price"": 170}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
