,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $80.  How about we split the difference at $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $140 is still quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get.  How about we meet halfway between $140 and my previous offer of $200? Would $170 work for you?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $170 is still too high for me. Let's try $150. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
