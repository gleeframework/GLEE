"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you given its worth to you.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to me. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a little out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $825,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
