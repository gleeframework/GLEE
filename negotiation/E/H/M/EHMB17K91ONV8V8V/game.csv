,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your interest in the product. While $8750 is close, I'm still a bit below what I need to make this work.  Would you consider a final offer of $8900? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know your final decision.",8900.0,Alice,5,
