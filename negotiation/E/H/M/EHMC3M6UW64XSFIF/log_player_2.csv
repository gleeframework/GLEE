"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  You can save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product to you is significant, and I can't go as low as $12,000.  Would you consider $13,000? It's a compromise that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  At $13,000, you're still getting a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  While you might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your next counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John."
