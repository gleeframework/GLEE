"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum value ($15,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's room for Bob to counteroffer without me immediately feeling like I need to sell to John.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000, and even lower than my initial offer of $14,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** There are still several rounds left, giving me an opportunity to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Potential for Better Offer:**  I believe I can get a better price than $12,500 from Bob or at least reach a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $13,500?  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my previous offer, but still keeping the price significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Maintain Value:**  $13,500 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm still using positive language and emphasizing the win-win nature of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. While it's closer than before, I'm not willing to settle for a price that low.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We've only reached round 4, and I have 6 more rounds to negotiate a better deal.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still potential for Bob to come up with a more reasonable offer, or I can make a counteroffer that closes the gap. 
* **Selling to John is the Last Resort:**  I'll only consider selling to John if I can't get a price closer to my minimum value through further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up a bit.  $13,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm happy to meet you in the middle again.  Let's go with $13,250. This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm only increasing my offer by $250, showing that I'm serious about a deal but still holding firm on my value.
* **Closing the Gap:** This brings the price closer to my minimum value and potentially closer to a point where Bob might accept.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I emphasize the ""middle ground"" and ""compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Positive Language:** I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,500. How about $13,000 again? I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  Even though we've been negotiating, I'm not willing to settle for a price that low.
* **Time is running out:** We are now in round 6, and I have only 4 rounds left to negotiate.  I want to try and squeeze out more profit before I have to consider selling to John.
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob has mentioned that he is willing to make one more compromise.  I believe there is still a chance that he will come up to a price closer to my minimum value.

I am still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob, so I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  However, if Bob does not come up with a better offer, I may have to seriously consider selling to John in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. But $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to compromise further - how about $13,150? It's just a small step up, but it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  I'm only increasing the price by $150, demonstrating a willingness to compromise without going too far below my minimum. 
* **Emphasize Agreement:** I'm reiterating that I want a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Keep the Door Open:** I'm aiming for a quick resolution to avoid running out of time and potentially having to sell to John.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm staying positive and hopeful that Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're in round 8, meaning only two rounds remain. I've reached a stalemate with Bob, and his offer is still below my minimum value.
* **No More Compromise:**  Bob has already made his ""final offer,"" indicating he is unlikely to increase his bid further.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which is much closer to my minimum value and significantly better than Bob's offer.

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure the highest possible price and avoid risking a lower price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
