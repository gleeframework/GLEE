"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $15,000? That's still a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $15,000, which would be $13,500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant about $13,500. Let's try $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
