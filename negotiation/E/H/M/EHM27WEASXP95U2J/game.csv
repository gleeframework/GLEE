"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $17,000. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me at $10,000.  Would you consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $17,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $13,500 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $11,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $11,500.  However, I need to be upfront that $10,000 is my absolute limit, and I'm prepared to walk away if we can't reach an agreement on this round.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $11,500, but I'm still not willing to meet you at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $12,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,7,
