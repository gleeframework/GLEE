Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $17,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is coming down, but we're still significantly above our ideal price. There's room to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $13,500 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $11,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has signaled that $12,500 is her bottom line, but we're not obligated to meet it.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and it's time to decide how much this extra value is worth to us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $11,500.  However, I need to be upfront that $10,000 is my absolute limit, and I'm prepared to walk away if we can't reach an agreement on this round."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're making a small concession to show willingness but also setting a firm boundary. This signals seriousness and potentially motivates Alice to close the deal.
* **Deadline Pressure:** By mentioning our absolute limit and a potential walk-away, we introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Alice to consider the offer more seriously.
* **Strategic Retreat:** If Alice rejects this offer, we can still accept her previous offer of $12,500 in the next round if we deem the extra value is worth it to us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $11,500, but I'm still not willing to meet you at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $12,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Loss:**  A $2,000 difference from our ideal price might be acceptable considering the product's value to us and the effort spent negotiating.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to an impasse, ultimately forcing us to buy from John at $10,000 anyway.  Accepting now saves time and potential frustration.
* **Potential Regret:** If we decline and Alice doesn't budge, we might regret not taking the $12,000 offer later. 

While getting the product for $10,000 would be ideal, accepting a slightly higher price to avoid further hassle and potential loss of the deal makes sense in this scenario."
