"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal for you, and I think we can make this work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, but not too high.  This is a good starting point for negotiation.  I want to see how Bob reacts to my initial offer.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm coming down from my initial price, but I'm still above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to give away the product for a price that's too low.  We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $75? That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $100. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer.  We're getting closer, but I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $75 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about $85? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to stick with my minimum threshold for now and see if Bob will budge.  I'm feeling optimistic about this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for working with me. I'm trying to stay within a tight budget.  Would you be willing to do it for $80? If so, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $100. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to get closer to my desired price. I've tried to reach a compromise, but it doesn't seem like it's going to happen with Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  It's a better deal for me, and it eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
