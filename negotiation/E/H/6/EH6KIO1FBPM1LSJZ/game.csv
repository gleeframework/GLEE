"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is still a great price for the value the product will bring to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
