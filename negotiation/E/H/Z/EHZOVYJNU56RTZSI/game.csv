"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a bit high at $12,000. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think we can meet somewhere in between $9,000 and $10,500. Let me know if that works for you.",9800.0,Bob,4,
