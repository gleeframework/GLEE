"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Alice's offer is overpriced. While she claims the product is worth $15,000 to me, I'm willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 and John is offering it at that price. By rejecting her offer, I can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or simply buy it from John at my maximum budget."
