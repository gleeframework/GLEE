Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still above what I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

``` 
This is a good point to accept.  While I could try to push for a bit more, Bob has stated this is his final offer. Accepting $11,500 is better than potentially losing him as a buyer and having to accept John's $12,000 offer.
