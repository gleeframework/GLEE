Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its true value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm starting high, but not too high, to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the value of the product.  Remember, I can always fall back to John's offer of $1,500,000 if the deal with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still need to make a decent profit on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still want to see if I can push him a little further before considering selling to John. I'm running out of rounds, and I need to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer.  It's a fair price for a product that will benefit your business.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but with only two rounds left, Bob's offer is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
