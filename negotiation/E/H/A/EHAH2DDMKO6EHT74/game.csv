"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth while still offering you a great deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
