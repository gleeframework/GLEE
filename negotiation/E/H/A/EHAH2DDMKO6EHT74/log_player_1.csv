Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

Bob's final offer is still significantly below my minimum. It's time to move on to John who is offering a price that reflects the product's true value."
