{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that could be a great addition to your business. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000, which is a significant discount considering its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price or force Bob to back out, opening the door for me to sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers your business. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still a significant distance away.  I'm not willing to give up $500,000 yet, especially since I know John is willing to pay my full asking price. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000 for this product.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,075,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I have only four rounds left, and I believe I can still push Bob higher, especially since John is waiting in the wings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. I'm willing to go to $1,150,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the product's value and the benefits it offers your business.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. I would like to propose a price of $1,125,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in round 8, leaving only two rounds left. While Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm not confident I can push Bob any higher in the remaining two rounds, and I risk ending up with a suboptimal price. Selling to John guarantees me my full asking price, ensuring the best outcome for me."
