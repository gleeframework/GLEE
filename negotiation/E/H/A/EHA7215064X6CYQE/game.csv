"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is too low for me.  It's worth at least $12,000 to me, so I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $12,500.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's make a deal!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,200. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal.",12200.0,Bob,4,
