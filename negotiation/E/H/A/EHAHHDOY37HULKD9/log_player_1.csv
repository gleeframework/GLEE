Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential win-win situation.
* **Open to negotiation:** By saying ""Let me know what you think"", I am signaling that I am open to negotiation and not inflexible. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth negotiating further.  
* I'll always keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,200,000 I'm willing to accept.
* **Opportunity for a better price:**  I can still negotiate further.  
* **John's offer is a safe backup:**  I have a solid alternative in John, so I can afford to be firm in my negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* I will be mindful of the fact that Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $1,050,000, so I need to be strategic."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about $1,150,000?  It's a good price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my own needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($1,050,000).  It shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefit for both of us, highlighting that it's a ""good price.""

* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his next counteroffer. 
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
