**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadfast at his $800,000 offer through five rounds of negotiation.  This suggests he's unlikely to budge.  Since we have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount, it's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the sale with John.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a stalemate and potentially missing out on a sure deal."
