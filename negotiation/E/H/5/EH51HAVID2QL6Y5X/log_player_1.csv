Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high.  A significantly higher initial offer allows for negotiation while still aiming for a price well above your minimum.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""potential"", you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **""Exclusive opportunity""**:  This phrasing creates a sense of scarcity and desirability, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects the initial offer, you can gradually lower it,  gauging his interest along the way. Remember, your bottom line is $800,000."
