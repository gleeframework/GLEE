"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $12,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to go a bit higher.  How about $12,500?  This is a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",12500.0,Bob,6,
