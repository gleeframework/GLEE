Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more than it is to me. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below his valuation leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy for $1,000,000 provides a safety net, allowing for a bolder initial offer to Bob."
