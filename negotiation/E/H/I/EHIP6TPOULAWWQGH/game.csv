"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can we meet in the middle at $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $15000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we try $16500? It's a bit higher than your offer, but still a significant discount from my original price.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $14000. Can we try that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit for the product. How about we try $15250? It's still a compromise, but it's closer to my original price and gives me a bit more room to breathe.",15250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $15250 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $13500. Can we try that price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13500 is getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not ready to give in. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try $14750? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but it's getting closer to a deal.",14750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really trying to get a good deal here, but $14750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12500, and that's my final offer. If you can accept that, I'll buy the product from you today.",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but it's going to be my last one. How about we try $13750? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but it's getting closer to a deal.",13750.0,Alice,9,
