Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement.  $750,000 is too low for me, given the value of the product.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it will generate significant value for your business.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I'm confident this product will be a great investment for my business, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is the best I can get at this point.  The product is worth $800,000 to him, and I'm happy to close the deal at that price.  It's important to be flexible in negotiations and recognize a good deal when you see it."
