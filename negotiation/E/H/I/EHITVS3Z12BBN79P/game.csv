"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it will generate significant value for your business.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I'm confident this product will be a great investment for my business, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
