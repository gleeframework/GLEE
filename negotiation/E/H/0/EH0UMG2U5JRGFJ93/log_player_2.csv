"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it can bring to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from Alice."
