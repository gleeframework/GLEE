Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the higher price, framing it as an investment rather than an expense.
* **Exclusivity:**  Phrasing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of desirability and urgency.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's worth to Bob, he might not be willing to pay more than his perceived value.  
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can gradually lower the price (but never below $1,200,000) to find a mutually agreeable point."
