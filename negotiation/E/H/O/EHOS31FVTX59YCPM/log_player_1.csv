{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to significantly increase your business potential. I'm confident it's worth at least $1 million to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950,000. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.**  This demonstrates that you're open to negotiation but also value the product.
* **It's less than the estimated value to Bob ($1,000,000).** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a strong starting point for negotiation.** If Bob rejects this, you can either counter with a slightly lower price or choose to sell to John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 900000}
