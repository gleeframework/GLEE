"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the true value and potential this product holds.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. If this isn't acceptable, I might have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
