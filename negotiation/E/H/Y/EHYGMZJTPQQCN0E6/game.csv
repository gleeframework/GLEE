"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Could you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the value I'm seeking. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000, reflecting the value you've mentioned and allowing for a reasonable profit for me. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,125,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is the minimum I can go to ensure a fair deal. I believe this price is still a good value for you, considering the benefits the product offers.
