Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a higher price:** I don't know Bob's value for the product, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay more than my minimum price. 
* **Risk mitigation:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out on any profit.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with minimizing risk."
