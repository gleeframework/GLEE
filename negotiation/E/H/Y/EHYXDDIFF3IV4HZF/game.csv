"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $150?  That's still a good deal for you, and allows me to get closer to what I need.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is closer, but I still need to get closer to my target.  How about $140?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still be happy with the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think $140 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $135, but no more. I think this is a fair price for the product.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $135 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $140 for a final offer. It's a great deal for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",140.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm really not comfortable going above $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $137.50. That's as high as I can go.",137.5,Bob,8,
