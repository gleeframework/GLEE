"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I do see value in the product, I believe $1,300,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  $1,150,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
