"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  It's below your maximum price of $100, but you can likely get a better deal. 
* **You have the advantage.** You know Alice values the product at $120, so you have room to negotiate.
* **No need to rush.** You have 10 rounds, and you can always buy from John as a backup. 

By rejecting the offer, you can explore if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  A $10 drop from Alice's offer is a significant move, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge how serious Alice is about selling at a lower price. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:** If Alice rejects this offer, you can still adjust your counteroffer upward in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming closer to your target:** $90 is a better offer than her initial $85, and it's getting closer to your maximum price of $100.
* **No need to risk further negotiations:**  While you could potentially get a lower price, there's a risk Alice could walk away entirely. 
* **John is a solid backup:**  You can always go to John if you're not satisfied with this deal.

Accepting the offer secures a good price for the product and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
