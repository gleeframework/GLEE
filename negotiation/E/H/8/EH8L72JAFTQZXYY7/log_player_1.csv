"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer yet. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $13,500 to make this worthwhile. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and still gives me a good profit."
