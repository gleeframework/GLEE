"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is tempting, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable value.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the significant value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $800,000.
