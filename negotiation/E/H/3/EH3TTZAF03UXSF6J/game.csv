"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $14,000 is still a little high for me. Could you consider something closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to your business.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,500 is close, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $11,500.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay close to $11,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $11,500. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is the best I can do, considering the value the product brings to your business.",12500.0,Alice,7,
