Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm not able to pay $2,000,000. Could we discuss a price closer to my budget, around $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would it be possible to lower the price to something closer to my budget, around $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer means losing out on a potential $100,000. It's strategically better to cut negotiations and take John's guaranteed offer."
