"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit too high for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say, $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still significantly lower than the value this product brings to you. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
