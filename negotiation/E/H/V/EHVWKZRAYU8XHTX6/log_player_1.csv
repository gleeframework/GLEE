{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's valuation but significantly lower than my minimum price. This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob accepts, I'll secure a decent profit.
2. **Initiate negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can use this information to adjust my counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise closer to my target price. 
3. **Maintain a backup option:**  I'm ready to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price at this point. I'll counter with a higher offer, aiming to find a compromise that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
