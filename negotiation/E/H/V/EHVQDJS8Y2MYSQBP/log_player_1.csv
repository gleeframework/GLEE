Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. My counteroffer for the product is $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the product's value, I still feel there's room for negotiation. My counteroffer for the product is now $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and he's moving in the right direction. It's too early to settle for anything less than $1,250,000 at this point."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. My counteroffer for the product is now $1,225,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting closer, but we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table.  His counteroffers are consistently increasing, showing willingness to pay. Let's push a bit further, but be prepared to accept if he comes up significantly in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm motivated to close this deal. My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to see this product in your hands."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the point where accepting John's offer is more appealing. This firm counteroffer establishes a clear bottom line for Bob while still leaving room for a small profit beyond John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've carefully considered the product's value and my budget, and I believe my final counteroffer should be $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $1,200,000 offer. Accepting his offer would net us less than John's guaranteed $1,000,000.  There's little point in further negotiation as the risk outweighs the potential reward at this stage.  It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure a guaranteed profit with John."
