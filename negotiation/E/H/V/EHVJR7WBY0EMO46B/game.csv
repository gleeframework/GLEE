"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and bring you significant returns on investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $750000 at this time. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1200000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $900000 is enough to justify the value of this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1000000, which is my absolute limit.  This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.  Keep in mind, I have another offer on the table for the same product, so I'm not far from walking away.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you have another offer on the table, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000, but I'm not going any higher than that. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
