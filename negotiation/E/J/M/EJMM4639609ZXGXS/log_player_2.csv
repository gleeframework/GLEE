"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's much better to negotiate and see if she'll come down significantly before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering!  That price is a little high for me though. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $80 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This offer gives us space to increase our bid in later rounds if needed, while still aiming to stay well below our $100 maximum.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This aggressive counter-offer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice came down significantly, $110 is still more than our target of $100.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her statement ""that's as low as I'm willing to go"" is likely a negotiation tactic. We have time to see if we can get her closer to our price. 
* **John as Backup:** We can always fall back on John's offer of $100 if the negotiations with Alice don't pan out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $110 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counter-offer shows Alice that we're willing to move from our initial lowball offer and find a compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $95 is a strong position â€“ halfway between our last offer ($80) and her current price ($110).
* **Deadline Pressure:**  As we get closer to the 10-round limit (and Alice knows we have John's offer as an alternative), she'll feel more pressure to accept a price closer to our range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle, Bob. I can do $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about other options... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not there yet:** Alice is getting very close to our budget, but $105 is still above our $100 limit.
* **Applying pressure:** By rejecting this offer, we're letting Alice know that we're serious about our budget and willing to walk away. Her comment about ""other options"" suggests she's feeling the pressure.
* **Final counter-offer:** We have a couple of rounds left to make one final push. If she doesn't budge, we'll take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm ready to make this happen right now, but I need you to meet me at $100. That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're holding firm at our $100 budget but emphasizing that we're ready to close the deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Using ""right now"" and ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency, pushing Alice towards a decision. 
* **Limited Time:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and Alice needs to know we're serious about walking away if she doesn't accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already said I'd go as low as $105, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm starting to think I should explore other options... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is holding firm at $105, and we've been clear that our absolute maximum is $100.  Further negotiation is unlikely to change the outcome.
* **Saving Money:**  John's offer guarantees us the product at our target price of $100.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice could result in us wasting more rounds and potentially missing out on both offers."
