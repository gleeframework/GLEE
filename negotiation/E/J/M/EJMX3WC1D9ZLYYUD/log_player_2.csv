"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is an exceptional value considering its worth to you is $8,000, and it's well below its market value of $10,000. I believe this offer presents a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the product's market value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price, potentially reaching a more favorable deal or, if necessary, moving on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my own. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $9,000. This is a more reasonable midpoint between our previous offers and allows us to move forward with a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
