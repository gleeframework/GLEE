"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my own. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $9,000. This is a more reasonable midpoint between our previous offers and allows us to move forward with a mutually beneficial transaction.",9000.0,Alice,3,
