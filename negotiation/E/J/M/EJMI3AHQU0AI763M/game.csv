"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth at least that much to me.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $11,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,250.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could finalize the transaction quickly.",12250.0,Bob,4,
