Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Emphasis on Value:** My message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with an open question, inviting Bob to respond and potentially start a negotiation. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open and flexible.  If Bob rejects the offer, I will be ready to counter and potentially move closer to his perceived value, while still ensuring a profit above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $11,000 is below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. There's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a fallback option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I meet my minimum goal.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation process and try to secure a higher price. If I can't, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm counteroffering with $13,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize value:** The message again highlights the value of the product for Bob.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly, aiming to maintain a constructive negotiation.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and secure a price that is closer to my minimum threshold.  If Bob still rejects, I can consider adjusting my counteroffer further or potentially accept his offer if it's the best I can achieve."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is just above my minimum threshold of $15,000. This ensures that I make a profit from the sale.
* **Limited negotiating room:** There's limited room for further negotiation with Bob, as he's already moved closer to my price. Further counteroffers might risk losing him as a buyer.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing the negotiation might take more time and effort without guaranteeing a better outcome.

While I would prefer to sell for closer to $15,000, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and financially viable option in this scenario. It allows me to make a profit while minimizing the risk of losing a sale and the potential for further negotiation to fail."
