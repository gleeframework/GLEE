"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a limited-time opportunity, as I have another interested buyer who's willing to pay $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I will reject the offer because it's too expensive for me. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, so I don't want to pay $20,000 for it. I will look for a better deal elsewhere.
