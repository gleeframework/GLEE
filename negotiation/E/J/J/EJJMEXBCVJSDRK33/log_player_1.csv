Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which still gives you a good value.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"

Round 6
