"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $20,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far too high.  It's significantly above your maximum price of $8,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I was hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $12,000. This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $8,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already spent a few rounds going back and forth. To avoid getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation, I'm going to take the guaranteed deal from John and purchase the product for $8,000."
