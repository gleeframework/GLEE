,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1750000? This is still a great deal for a product with this kind of value and potential. Let's meet in the middle.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate. While $1400000 is closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
