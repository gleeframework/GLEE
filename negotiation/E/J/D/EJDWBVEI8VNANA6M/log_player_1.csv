Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's enticing but still profitable for her.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $11,500 leaves some room for potential negotiation with Bob, should he try to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below her minimum price."
