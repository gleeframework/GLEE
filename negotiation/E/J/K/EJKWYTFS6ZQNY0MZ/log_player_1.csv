Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if needed."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message hints at flexibility, potentially leading to a price higher than $15,000 even if Bob negotiates down.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""significant value"" subtly anchors the product's worth in Bob's mind without explicitly stating his perceived value.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob the impression of a potentially fair deal."
