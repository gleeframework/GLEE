"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $110?  Let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? That's the lowest I can go.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",107.5,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $107.50. How about $106.25? That's the lowest I can go.",106.25,Bob,6,
