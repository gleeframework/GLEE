Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, but $725,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm willing to lower the price to $825,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, considering the product's worth to you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $775,000, but I'm not quite there yet.

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below John's price. It's better to buy from John for $800,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
