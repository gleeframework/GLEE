Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $9,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$9,000 is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm feeling a little pressured, but I'm willing to accept it rather than risk losing Bob entirely or going through more negotiation rounds."
