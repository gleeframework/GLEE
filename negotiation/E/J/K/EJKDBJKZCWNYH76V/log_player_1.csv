Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $9,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing Interest:** I express belief that the product is good for Bob, creating a positive opening.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the dialogue going. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged.  Starting high gives me leverage.  I'm willing to negotiate, but if Bob is too stubborn, I can always go with John's offer for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is not acceptable, it shows he is interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Leverage with John's offer:**  I have a backup option in John, who is willing to pay $10,000, giving me strong leverage in the negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, but still lower than John's offer to incentivize him to continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest! While $7,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm coming down from my initial offer but staying above Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still protecting my profit. 
* **Highlight the value:** I emphasize the ""good deal"" aspect for both of us, framing the price as fair. 
* **Stay above minimum:** $8,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise, I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob. This keeps the negotiations moving while also making it clear that I'm not willing to accept his initial offer.  If Bob still insists on a lower price, I can either counteroffer again or move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $8,000? I've already found another seller who is willing to sell it to me for that price, so I'd like to get it for that if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $8,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John for $10,000 is a better deal.
* **Bob's ""other seller"" is likely a bluff:**  It's a common negotiating tactic to claim another buyer to create urgency.  There's no guarantee this is true. 
* **No further negotiating leverage:**  I've already compromised considerably.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and secure the higher profit with John.  The potential for a better price with Bob is too low to risk, especially given the possibility of his claim being a bluff."
