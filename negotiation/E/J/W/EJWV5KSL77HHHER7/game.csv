"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $12,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $8,000? That's the highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000, Bob. That's below my minimum price. I can offer you a compromise at $14,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
