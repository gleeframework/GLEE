# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $10,500 is a significant drop from Alice's $14,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, $10500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $12500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show a willingness to compromise:**  Increase your offer slightly, demonstrating you're taking Alice's position seriously.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```
