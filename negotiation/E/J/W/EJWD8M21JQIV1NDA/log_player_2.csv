"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've priced at $12,000, but considering its worth to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price, giving you a substantial saving, and allowing me a good return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
