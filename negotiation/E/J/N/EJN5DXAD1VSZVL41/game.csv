"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested, Alice, but I'm not quite there yet.  Would you consider $87.50? It's a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $87.50. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $91?",91.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $91 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $89? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",89.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $89. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle on $90.50?",90.5,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting really close here.  I'm still hoping to get this done for $89.  That's my final offer. What do you say?",89.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm not willing to give in just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $90, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",90.0,Alice,9,
