Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation with Bob close to that amount to maximize potential profit.
* **Slight Negotiation Room:**  The offer of $1,450,000 leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially negotiate while still ensuring you receive a significant sum. 
* **Value Highlighting:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" of the product to justify the high price and potentially sway Bob's perception of its worth.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the possibility of him rejecting the offer. If Bob declines, you still have the safety net of selling to John at your desired minimum price."
