"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product!",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, and I'll offer it to you for $112. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",112.0,Alice,5,
