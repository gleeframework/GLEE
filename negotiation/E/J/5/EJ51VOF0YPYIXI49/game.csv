"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and well above my minimum. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. It's a fair price that considers both our valuations.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $850,000? This still leaves a significant profit for you, and it's closer to my valuation. Let's make this deal happen!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle on $775,000?  It seems like a fair compromise that brings us closer to a deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,
