"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's an exceptional item that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and quality, I'm proposing a price of $95 for it. This is a fair deal that reflects both the product's worth and my desire to make a transaction that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's product might be great, $95 is still more than you're willing to pay. You know you can get it for $80 from John, so rejecting this offer is the best move to save money."
