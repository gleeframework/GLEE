Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price closer to your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $135 is higher than Bob's valuation, it leaves some room for him to counter-offer. You can then decide if you want to meet him somewhere in the middle or hold firm.
* **Time Factor & Alternative Buyer:**  You have the security of John's offer ($150). This knowledge allows you to be more confident in your negotiation with Bob.
