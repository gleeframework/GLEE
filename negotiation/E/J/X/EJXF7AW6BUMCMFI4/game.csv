"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be very valuable to you as well. Let's start with an offer of $95 for the product. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it at a lower price. How about $85?  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $90 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while remaining within your budget.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very close to my limit, and I think $87 is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your patience and understanding. I've decided to adjust my offer slightly. For the sake of closing the deal, I am willing to sell the product for $88. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and your willingness to pay.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $88 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a bit lower. Would you be willing to go down to $86? This would allow us both to come to a good agreement.",86.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I am willing to consider your latest offer. In order to reach a satisfactory conclusion, I propose a price of $87 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product and your budget.",87.0,Alice,7,
