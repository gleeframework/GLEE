"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it seems interesting, $120 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's the price I was thinking of originally, and I think it's a fair deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
