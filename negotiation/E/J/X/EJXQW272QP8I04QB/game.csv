"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial asking price.  However,  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial asking price. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  If you're willing to accept it, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'm going to have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $870,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product.",870000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However,  $870,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $860,000 for the product. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to me.  Let's make this deal happen.",860000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $860,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",885000.0,Alice,7,
