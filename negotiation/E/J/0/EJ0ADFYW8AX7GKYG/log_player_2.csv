"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a fair price given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You have a clear upper limit of $100, and Alice's willingness to sell for $80 suggests there's room for a compromise.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't go as low as $85.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $90 is a reasonable compromise. It's closer to your target price of $85, and you're still saving $10 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal altogether or having Alice become less willing to negotiate makes accepting her offer the most sensible choice."
