"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.**  You're aiming to spend no more than $1,000,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Alice is willing to sell for less than her own valuation of $1,200,000, indicating potential for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is the safest option.**  It guarantees the best price, but you may be able to get a slightly lower price by negotiating with Alice.

**Next Steps:**

* You'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round.  It's a good idea to start close to your maximum price, but be prepared to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting close to your maximum:**  $950,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer but still allows room for further negotiation.
* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This offer shows your seriousness and willingness to negotiate, but it's not so low that Alice might immediately reject it.
* **Testing the waters:**  By offering $950,000, you're gauging how flexible Alice is and how much room there is to bargain. 

**Next Steps:**

* Depending on Alice's response, you'll need to adjust your strategy. If she rejects, you'll need to consider increasing your offer slightly or potentially looking at John's offer if time is a concern.  If she accepts, great! You've saved a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target:** While it's lower than her previous offer, $1,050,000 is still higher than your desired price of $1,000,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** Alice has lowered her price, showing a willingness to negotiate. This suggests that you might be able to get closer to your target price with another counteroffer.
* **John's offer remains the safest option:**  If you can't get Alice to come down further, you have a guaranteed deal with John.

**Next Steps:**

* You should make another counteroffer, aiming for a price between your previous offer and your target.  Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Alice's response."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This offer is your final attempt to get Alice to accept a price within your budget.
* **Target price:**  $1,000,000 is your absolute maximum, and you're not willing to go higher.
* **Risk assessment:**  There's a risk Alice might reject this, but you have John's offer as a backup.

**Next Steps:**

* If Alice rejects this offer, you'll likely go with John's offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure a purchase.
* If Alice accepts, you've successfully secured the product within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is a factor:**  We're now in round 5, and each round brings us closer to the 10-round limit.
* **Marginal savings:** While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, it's still above your target price of $1,000,000. The potential savings are minimal.
* **Guaranteed deal:**  John offers a guaranteed deal at your desired price.  There's no risk of further negotiation or potential price increases.

**Next Steps:**

* It's more efficient and safer to secure the product from John at this point.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice could lead to further rounds and potentially a higher price or a failed deal."
