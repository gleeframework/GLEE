"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is of great value to your business. My asking price is $1,200,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is not quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer still provides you with a significant return on your investment and allows me to achieve a fair price for this valuable product. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still above my target. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a significant amount and represents a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue working towards a mutually agreeable price. While $1,000,000 is closer to where I need to be, I'm proposing $1,050,000 as a final counteroffer. This reflects the significant value of this product for your company and allows us to move forward with this transaction. I'm confident this price is fair and represents a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
