Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than the product's value to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiations to leave room for compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone in my message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him more inclined to accept the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers by saying ""Let me know what you think."" 

This offer gives me a strong starting point while also allowing for flexibility in the negotiation process. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and I'll be prepared to adjust my price accordingly while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I could accept and sell to him for $9,000, that would be less than what John is offering. I'm not willing to lose money on this sale, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still give you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a fair price.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm again highlighting the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of its worth.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""great deal"" to make the offer seem more appealing. 

I believe this counteroffer will be more attractive to Bob than his initial offer, while still allowing me to earn more than I would by selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that we'll go back and forth for a while without reaching an agreement.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the guaranteed $10,000 from John.  This ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation."
