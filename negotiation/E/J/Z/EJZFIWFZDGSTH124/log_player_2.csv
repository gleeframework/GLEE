You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $15,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
