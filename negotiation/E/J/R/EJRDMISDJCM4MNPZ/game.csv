"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $107? It's a small step down from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really determined to get this product! I'm willing to come down a little further, but $107 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $109? That would be a good compromise for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
