"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not willing to go as high as $950000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900000. This is a great compromise that still allows us to make a profit while giving you a discount on the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We're willing to consider it, but we still need to make a profit on this deal. We're willing to meet you at $915000, but that's as low as we can go. We're confident that this is a fair price for both parties.",915000.0,Alice,5,
