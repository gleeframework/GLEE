Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  It's a unique item, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value and uniqueness, I aim to justify the higher price to Bob.
* **Alternative Option:** While I haven't explicitly mentioned John, the fact that I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 gives me leverage. Bob might be more inclined to accept a higher price if he perceives the product as desirable and potentially scarce. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, I might be willing to negotiate the price down. However, I'll always aim to secure a price that's significantly above my minimum of $10,000."
