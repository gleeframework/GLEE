{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $12,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still allows for negotiation. It leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **""Open to negotiation"":** This signals that I'm willing to compromise, which encourages Bob to engage in further discussion. 

This offer balances the need to maximize profit with the potential of losing the deal to John if I'm too inflexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'm still confident that I can get a better price through continued negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $10,500:** This is a compromise, offering a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. It shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasis on ""good deal"":**  This framing highlights the potential benefit for both of us, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and open tone keeps the negotiation productive and avoids creating a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm still a bit below your last offer, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While Bob seems willing to negotiate, the gap between our positions is too wide, and it's unlikely that I can secure a price that is truly satisfactory to me.  Therefore, selling to John at $15,000 is the most profitable and secure option, guaranteeing my desired minimum price and avoiding further negotiation."
