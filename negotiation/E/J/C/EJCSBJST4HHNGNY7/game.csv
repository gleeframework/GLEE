"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make at least $9,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8,750. That's the best I can do. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $8,900.  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think I can do better. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",8800.0,Bob,6,
