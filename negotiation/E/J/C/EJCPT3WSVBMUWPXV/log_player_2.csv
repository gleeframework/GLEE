"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price by negotiating.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target of saving as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $800,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a good middle ground. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer and is a good price for me. Buying from John would cost me $1,000,000, so it makes more sense to accept Alice's offer and save $250,000. While I could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and I'll end up paying the full $1,000,000 to John.  $750,000 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it."
