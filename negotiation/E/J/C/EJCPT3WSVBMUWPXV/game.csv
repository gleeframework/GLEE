"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $800,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a good middle ground. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Alice,3,
