"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider lowering the price to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to negotiate a slightly better price. Would you be willing to consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",8200.0,Alice,5,
