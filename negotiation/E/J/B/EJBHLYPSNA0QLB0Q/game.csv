"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $850,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also giving you a good deal on the product. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. How about $925,000? I feel that's a reasonable compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $925,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",975000.0,Alice,5,
