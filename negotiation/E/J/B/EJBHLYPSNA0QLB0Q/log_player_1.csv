Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $850,000 would be a fair price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. How about $925,000? I feel that's a reasonable compromise.
