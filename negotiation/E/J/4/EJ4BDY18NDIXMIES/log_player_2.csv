Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,250,000? This gives us both a fair deal, and we can close this quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,150,000 just isn't feasible for me.  Let's split the difference: $1,200,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finally close this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is coming down in price, and we are getting close to a price that saves a significant amount compared to John's offer.  While we could potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, the difference is getting smaller, and there's a risk Alice might not budge much further.  $1,200,000 is a good deal."
