"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is better than $12,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price of $9,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $10,000, but still leaves room for Alice to profit while being closer to Bob's desired price. This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is serious about getting the product but is also committed to finding a price that is fair to him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price of $8,000.  Bob is willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get a lower price closer to his target.  The fact that Alice lowered her offer from $10,000 to $9,500 indicates a willingness to negotiate, which encourages Bob to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer slightly from $9,000, showing he's willing to compromise. At $9,250, he's still below Alice's offer but closer to his desired price. This counteroffer signals that Bob is serious about purchasing the product but is also determined to find a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $9,400 is still higher than Bob's target price of $8,000. While Bob could continue to negotiate, the difference is only $1,400.  He has already been negotiating for a while and is likely getting close to his limit for negotiation. It's more efficient for Bob to simply purchase from John at $8,000,  securing the product for his desired price."
