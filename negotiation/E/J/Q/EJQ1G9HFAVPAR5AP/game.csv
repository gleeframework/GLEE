"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for this product. It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your potential profit. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this.",9500.0,Bob,4,
