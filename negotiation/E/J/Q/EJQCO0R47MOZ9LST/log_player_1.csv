Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be happy to buy it for $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I believe it's also a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.

How about $13,000?  This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product fairly.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.
