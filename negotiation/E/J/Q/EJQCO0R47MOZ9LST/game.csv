"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $13,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be happy to buy it for $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I believe it's also a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's also a fair price for me considering the minimum I'm willing to sell for. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the compromise you've offered.  While $14,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to bring it down a bit.  How about $13,000?  This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product fairly.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $14,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. How about we meet at $13,750? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13750.0,Alice,5,
