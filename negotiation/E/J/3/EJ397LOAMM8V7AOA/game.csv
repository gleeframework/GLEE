"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $18000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value you place on the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $12000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiation, Bob! I understand your desire to reach a fair price, but $12000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll add a slight premium to my previous offer. I'll counteroffer at $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm appreciative of your flexibility, but $13500 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go to $12500, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'll counteroffer at $14000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,7,
