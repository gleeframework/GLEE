"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you consider $105? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",107.5,Alice,3,
