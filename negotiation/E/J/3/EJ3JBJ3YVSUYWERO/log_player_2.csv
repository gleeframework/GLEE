# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is better for Bob than buying from John for $12,000.  Even though Bob values the product at $12,000, he can still save $500 by accepting Alice's offer."
