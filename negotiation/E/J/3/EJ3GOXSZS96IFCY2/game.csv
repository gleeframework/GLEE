"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product is valuable, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll meet you at $850,000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, my absolute maximum.  This is a very fair offer considering I have other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $800,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll meet you at $875,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",875000.0,Alice,7,
