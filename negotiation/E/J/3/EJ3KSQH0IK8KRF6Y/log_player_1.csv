**Reasoning:** Bob is very unlikely to go above $100. He's been consistently lowballing and inching up very slowly.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a worse offer or no deal at all. Accepting John's offer guarantees a sale at your minimum acceptable price."
