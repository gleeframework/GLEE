Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (You have a guaranteed buyer)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Your Leverage:** You have an alternative buyer.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum price, you're in a strong position.  You want to aim for a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but not so high that he'll automatically reject it.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as desirable (""exclusive opportunity,"" ""unique value"").
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,350,000 is a starting point. It's above Bob's value, but leaves room for negotiation if you want to secure a deal with him.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""significant benefits"" subtly reminds Bob of the value proposition, potentially justifying the price in his mind. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start higher.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:** Are you willing to risk losing Bob to get closer to $1,500,000, or is a sure sale at $1,350,000 preferable?

**After the Offer**

Be prepared to:

* **Negotiate:** Bob will likely counter-offer. Having a clear idea of your walk-away point is crucial.
* **Walk Away:**  If Bob won't meet a price you find acceptable, you have the security of John's offer."
