{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point,  I'm aiming for a high price but also leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aware that Bob values the product more than I do, but I want to ensure I get a good price. I'll be ready to counter any offer he makes, while keeping John's offer of $8,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, keeping in mind Bob's budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? It's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than John's offer.  $10,000 is a good compromise, and it's better to secure the sale than to risk losing both Bob and John."
