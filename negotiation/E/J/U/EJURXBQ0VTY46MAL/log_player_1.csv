{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price above my minimum ($100) but leaves some room for negotiation, acknowledging that Bob likely values the product higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $115 for it.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $115 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer and try to split the difference."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $122.50?  That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  How about $120?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, $120 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John.  I'll take it!"
