**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $120, which is less than the $150 John is asking. 
* **You are willing to pay up to $150:**  You stated your maximum price is $150, so Alice's offer fits within your budget.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
