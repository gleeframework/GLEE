"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $110. This leaves little room for negotiation and still puts the price above your maximum value of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have 10 rounds to reach a deal, so rejecting the initial offer opens the door for counteroffers and a potential better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within your range:** This offer is within your maximum price point of $120 and still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Fair but firm:** It's a fair starting point that acknowledges Alice's value but also shows you're serious about a lower price.
* **Open to discussion:** The message keeps the negotiation open and invites Alice to counter if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice has moved to $108, which is halfway between her previous offer of $110 and your counteroffer of $105.
* **Within your budget:** This price is still within your maximum of $120.
* **Time is valuable:** While you could continue negotiating, accepting this offer saves time and effort, especially since you have 10 rounds total."
