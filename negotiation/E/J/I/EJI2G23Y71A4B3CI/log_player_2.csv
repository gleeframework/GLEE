"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $115. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price. You can always buy from John for $100 if you don't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's a great deal for you, and we can close this quickly. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You're still a little over your maximum price point, but Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate.  Let's see if we can get that price down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a little over my budget.  I'm willing to go to $108, would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $108 isn't quite there for me. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is stuck on $110, and we're at round 5.  It's unlikely we'll get her lower, and we've already wasted a couple rounds.  It's time to cut our losses and go with John's offer."
