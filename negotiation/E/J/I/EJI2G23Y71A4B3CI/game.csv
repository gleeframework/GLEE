,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's a great deal for you, and we can close this quickly. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a little over my budget.  I'm willing to go to $108, would you be open to that?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $108 isn't quite there for me. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
