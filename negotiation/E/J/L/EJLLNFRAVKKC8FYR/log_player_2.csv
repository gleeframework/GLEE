"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:

* Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,450,000 vs. $1,200,000), indicating there's room for negotiation. 
* You have a clear upper limit of $1,500,000, making a counteroffer a more strategic move than immediately buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, I'm looking to acquire it for a price closer to $1,350,000. This would represent a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,350,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning:

* Alice has moved closer to your ideal price, making her offer more appealing. 
* While you could continue negotiating, the risk of a further rejection and having to buy from John for a higher price is now greater.
* Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John, making it a worthwhile decision."
