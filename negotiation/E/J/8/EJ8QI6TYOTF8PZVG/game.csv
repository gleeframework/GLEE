,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my own costs and the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $12,000, so I'll offer you the product for $10,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $9,500. Can we meet at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $10,000. That's my minimum price, and I'm not willing to budge. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though - I'll offer the product to you for $10,250. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to give me a slight discount, but $10,250 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,250, so I'll offer $9,875. Can we meet at this price?",9875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $9,875. I'll give you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer the product to you for $10,100. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",10100.0,Alice,7,
