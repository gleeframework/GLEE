Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to propose a counter-offer."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that your asking price is justified without explicitly revealing your minimum.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** By indicating you're ""open to discussing,"" you encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** While you have John as a backup, it's not beneficial to bring him up yet. Doing so could weaken your negotiating position with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, any price above $15,000 is a profit for you."
