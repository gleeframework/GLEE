"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm thinking a price of $14,000 would be fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate down towards a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to bring the price down significantly while still leaving room for further negotiation. It also expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  While $10,000 is tempting, the true value of this product is much higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, $12,000 is still too high considering her value is $8,000. We can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the value you see in the product, Alice.  To be frank, $12,000 is a bit beyond my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

We're nudging closer to the midpoint, showing willingness to compromise but not too drastically. This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's make this final offer: $11,500. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and this price is a good compromise. It's risky to push further and risk her walking away, leaving us with John's higher price."
