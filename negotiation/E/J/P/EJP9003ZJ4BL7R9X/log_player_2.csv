"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

It's better to reject Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay $80, and you have a guaranteed alternative with John at that price.  Negotiating with Alice has the potential to get the price lower."

I'm offering $75 as a starting point. This is a fair price considering my budget and the alternative with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my limit, I can still try to negotiate further.  John offers a guaranteed price of $80, so there's still room to get a better deal with Alice."

I'm offering Alice my final price of $80. This matches John's price, so if she rejects it, I'll be moving on to John."
