"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's discuss a price of $950,000. This would be a significant gain for you, and a fair price for the value I'm offering.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
