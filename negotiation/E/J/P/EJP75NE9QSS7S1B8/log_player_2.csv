"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $140 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit steep for me, though.  Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A low counteroffer will reveal how willing she is to negotiate. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Even if she rejects this offer, there's space to increase our bid gradually. 
* **Potentially secure a great deal:**  There's always a chance Alice might accept a lower offer if she's motivated to sell quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, we're still aiming for a better deal. Let's counter again and see if we can get closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  Could you do $120? I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

We're now proposing a price that matches Alice's valuation of the product. This is a strategic move:

* **Direct Approach:** We're being clear about what we're willing to pay.
* **Testing the Waters:** This will show us if Alice is truly willing to sell at her minimum or if she'll hold out for more. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Alice rejects this offer, we can still accept her previous offer of $130, which is within our budget."
