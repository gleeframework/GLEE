{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with my highest possible price, knowing that the product is worth at least $150 to me. 
* **Messaging:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By starting high, I create room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter his offer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $150. 
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $150 provides a safety net, ensuring I won't settle for a price below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.  
* **John's Offer:** I'm not willing to settle for $100, especially since I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum.  
* **Next Round:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, Thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $125, which is halfway between Bob's offer and my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate for a sale.
* **Messaging:** I'm staying polite and acknowledging Bob's offer while clearly stating my position.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  By compromising a bit, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept my offer, while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to make further concessions, but I'll try to stay above $125 as long as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $125 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $115 is still below my ideal outcome.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm not desperate for a sale and John's offer provides a safety net.  
* **Next Round:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob again, aiming to bridge the gap and get closer to my minimum price of $150.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $150 offer from John, so I'm not willing to settle for less."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest.  How about we split the difference and settle on $120?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a counteroffer of $120, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $125 and Bob's latest offer of $115. 
* **Messaging:** I'm emphasizing the idea of fairness and a compromise to make the offer more appealing.
* **Strategic Compromise:** By meeting Bob halfway, I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests. 
* **Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider my options. While I have John as a backup, I might be willing to lower my price further to secure the sale with Bob, but only if it's closer to my minimum price of $150."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I've already made several concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower.  
* **John's Offer:**  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price of $150, it makes more sense to sell to him.  
* **Final Decision:** Selling to John guarantees me the best possible outcome, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profit."
