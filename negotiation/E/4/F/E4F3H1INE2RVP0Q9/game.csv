"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth at least that much to you. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to me. Let's make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting fair value for this product.  How about $1,050,000? This is a compromise that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to close this deal without having to go to another buyer. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
