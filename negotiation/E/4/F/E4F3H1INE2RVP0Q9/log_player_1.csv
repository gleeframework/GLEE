"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth at least that much to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit. It also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to me. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. It's better to keep negotiating with Bob, aiming for a higher price.  Selling to John right now would be settling for a lower profit than I could potentially get by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting fair value for this product.  How about $1,050,000? This is a compromise that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I have a few rounds left and John is waiting to buy for $1,000,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to close this deal without having to go to another buyer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
