"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
