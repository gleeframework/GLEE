Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit higher than I was thinking. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're getting close to my minimum, but I'm not there yet. It's worth risking another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to $1,200,000."
