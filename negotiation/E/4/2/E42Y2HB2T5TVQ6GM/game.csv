"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than $1,000,000 given its potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest and understanding. I've tried to be flexible, and $1,400,000 really is pushing the boundaries of what I can accept.  To be completely open,  $1,250,000 is the lowest I can go and still make this work.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
