Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm confident that the product is worth at least that much to me, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is still less than my initial goal, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale."
