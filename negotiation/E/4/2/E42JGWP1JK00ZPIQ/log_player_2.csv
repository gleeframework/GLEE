The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice's offer is way too high. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This will hopefully encourage her to negotiate and hopefully land us on a price I'm comfortable with."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing willingness to compromise, but still staying within my budget.  I'm hoping this will get us closer to an agreement."
