Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still exceeding our minimum selling price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, but still ensures we get a good price. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a backup who will pay our desired minimum price."
