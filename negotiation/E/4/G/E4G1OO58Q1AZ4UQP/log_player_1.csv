``` 

I'm starting with a high price to see what Bob's reaction is. I want to maximize my profit, but I'm also willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product. I am interested in purchasing the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $950000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is still quite high. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I want to see if I can push him up to $975,000 or even closer to $1,000,000."

Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push him a little bit higher. I'm confident I can get him to at least $970,000.  It's still early in the negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my initial offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your persistence, Alice. I appreciate your belief in the product's value. I am willing to meet you halfway at $970000. This would allow us to come to an agreement that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is just $5,000 away from my target price of $975,000. Considering that we're already in the 6th round, I'm willing to accept this offer. It's a good deal for me, and it's likely that further negotiation might not yield a much higher price."
