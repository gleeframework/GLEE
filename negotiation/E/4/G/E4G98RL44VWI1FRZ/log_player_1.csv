Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer and my willingness to negotiate further. I also have the option to sell to John at $120 if I feel the negotiation isn't going anywhere."
