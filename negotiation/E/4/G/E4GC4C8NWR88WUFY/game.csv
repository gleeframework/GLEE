"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair considering my needs and the product's value.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,700,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This reflects my budget and the value I see in this product. I'm hopeful we can find a compromise here.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
