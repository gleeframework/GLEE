"Bob, while I understand your perspective on the price, $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $850,000?  It's a fair price that acknowledges your interest while ensuring I receive a reasonable return on my investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
