"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which I believe is a fair value considering its worth to you is $10,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for, and still a great value for you?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a little.  $12,000 is still too high for me though.  How about we split the difference at $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I've already received an offer from another buyer who is willing to pay the minimum of $12,000, so I need to consider that. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
