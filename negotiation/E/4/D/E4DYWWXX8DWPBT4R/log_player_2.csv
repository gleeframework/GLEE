"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which I believe is a fair value considering its worth to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for, and still a great value for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I've already received an offer from another buyer who is willing to pay the minimum of $12,000, so I need to consider that. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $11,500. She knows your maximum price and is using another potential buyer to pressure you.  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is your maximum price. It makes no sense to pay more than you have to."
