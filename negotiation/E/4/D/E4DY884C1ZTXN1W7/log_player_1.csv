Round 6
Bob's offer:

At this point, Bob is consistently moving towards the middle ground, and while there's a chance to get a bit more, $1,525,000 is a significant profit.  The risk of Bob lowering his offer significantly or walking away outweighs the potential reward of holding out for a higher price."
