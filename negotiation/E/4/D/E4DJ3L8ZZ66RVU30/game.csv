"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $12000 for it. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value it holds for me, but I am only able to offer $9000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500, which is still a significant discount from what it's worth to you. Let's meet halfway.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the reduction. I would like to counter with an offer of $10000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to come up in price. However, $10000 is still a bit below what I need to let this product go. I'm prepared to go down to $11000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10500 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down just a little further to $10750.  This is a small compromise, but it's the best I can do at this point.",10750.0,Alice,7,
