"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. It's a great deal, considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting high, but still leaving room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point, as it's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value and leaves room for me to potentially earn more than my minimum.  It also gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value it holds for me, but I am only able to offer $9000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's still closer to my minimum than selling to John. I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a significant discount from what it's worth to you. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the reduction. I would like to counter with an offer of $10000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum. I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to come up in price. However, $10,000 is still a bit below what I need to let this product go. I'm prepared to go down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your proposal carefully. I believe we can reach a fair agreement. I would like to counter with an offer of $10500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down just a little further to $10,750.  This is a small compromise, but it's the best I can do at this point."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. I would like to counter with an offer of $10600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although this offer is still below my minimum, it's only slightly so and we are nearing the end of the rounds. It's likely that a counteroffer from me will be rejected by Bob, and I risk losing a good deal. It's best to accept this offer now and secure a sale."
