"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering your stated value and my maximum limit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is just too far below what I need to receive for this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
