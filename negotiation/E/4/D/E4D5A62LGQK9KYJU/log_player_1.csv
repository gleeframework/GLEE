Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This makes the offer attractive to him, encouraging him to consider it.
* **Lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This provides room for negotiation without jeopardizing your own profit. 
* **Leaves room for counteroffers:**  This allows for a more dynamic negotiation, potentially reaching a mutually beneficial price.

By offering a slightly higher price, you increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, while still securing a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering your stated value and my maximum limit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would mean a substantial loss for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I receive a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is just too far below what I need to receive for this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
