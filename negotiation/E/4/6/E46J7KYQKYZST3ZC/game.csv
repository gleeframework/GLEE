"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800000 is too far below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This reflects the value of the product and still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1700000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring your product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1600000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for your business. Let's make this deal happen.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1200000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement. I've already come down significantly from my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it demonstrates my strong interest in your product.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
