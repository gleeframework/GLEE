"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great asset to you. It's currently valued at $15,000 for me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my usual price, and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
