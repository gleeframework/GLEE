"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great asset to you. It's currently valued at $15,000 for me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my usual price, and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think!",13500.0,Alice,1,
