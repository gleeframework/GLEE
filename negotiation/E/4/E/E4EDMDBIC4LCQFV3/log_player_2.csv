# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product.

While Alice is negotiating, her final offer is still higher than John's price. It makes more sense to buy from John at this point and secure the $800,000 price."
