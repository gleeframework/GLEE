"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but the price is a bit high. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for it. This seems like a fair deal considering its value to me. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the reply. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while respecting its value.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll meet you at $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
