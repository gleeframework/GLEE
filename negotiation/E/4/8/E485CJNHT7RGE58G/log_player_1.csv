"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to start high. I know the product is worth $10,000 to me, and I'm hoping to get as close to that as possible.  While Bob might think this is too high, I'm setting the stage for a negotiation that will hopefully bring us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway. I know he's willing to pay up to $9,500, and I'm willing to go down from $11,000.  This is a good compromise, and hopefully, he'll see that it's a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation.  There's always a chance that the negotiation could go sour, and I'd rather guarantee the sale at a price that's only slightly below my ideal."
