"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a better price.  $9,500 is still higher than your ideal price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  We'll see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous one, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, you're still only a few hundred dollars away. It's worth trying to negotiate a little further to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

This counteroffer shows your commitment to negotiating but also acknowledges Alice's decreasing price.  We'll see if she's willing to accept a deal at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Alice's offer is very close to your target price. It's unlikely you'll be able to get a significantly better deal, and it's risky to continue negotiating with only 3 rounds remaining. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a price that's within your budget."
