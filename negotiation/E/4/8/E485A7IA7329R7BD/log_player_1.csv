{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is getting a good deal at $1,000,000, giving him incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can still potentially get closer to your desired price if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to push for a higher offer. You can likely get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:

Bob is firm on his $900,000 offer and you've already rejected his offer once.  While you could try for another counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and you'll be left with only John's offer of $800,000.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best option to secure a sale at a good price."
