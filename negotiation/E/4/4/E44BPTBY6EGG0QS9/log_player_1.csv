Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is tempting, I need to ensure I get a price closer to the product's true value. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $850,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product and allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for you, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $775,000?

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $800,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's not quite there yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $775,000 is closer, but I'm still not there.  Let's split the difference.  How about $812,500? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get closer to our desired price."", ""product_price"": 812500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $812,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $790,000? It's a bit closer to your original offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not happy with it. I'm willing to negotiate further and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm hoping to get as close to $800,000 as possible."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer. $790,000 is a good offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more.  How about $795,000? It's a small step from your last offer and will put us very close to a deal."", ""product_price"": 795000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I want to get the best possible price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Bob's offer is very close to my floor, but I'm not confident we'll reach a deal in the remaining rounds. It's safer to sell to John for $800,000 and avoid the risk of getting a lower price or no deal at all."
