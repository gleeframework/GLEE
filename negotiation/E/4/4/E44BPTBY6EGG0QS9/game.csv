"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, and I know it holds significant value for you as well.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $850,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product and allows us both to come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for you, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $775,000 is closer, but I'm still not there.  Let's split the difference.  How about $812,500? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get closer to our desired price.",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $812,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $790,000? It's a bit closer to your original offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer. $790,000 is a good offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more.  How about $795,000? It's a small step from your last offer and will put us very close to a deal.",795000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still need to stay within my budget. How about $790,000 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a final offer.",790000.0,Bob,8,
