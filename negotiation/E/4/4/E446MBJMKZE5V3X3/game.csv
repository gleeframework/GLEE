"Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to commit to a budget of $500000 for this purchase. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'll need to be more realistic about the value of the product. Considering its unique features and market demand, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1800000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the value of the product, but based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with the product's value in your eyes.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1200000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value and the fact that we're close to the original offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $1700000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth and your budget constraints.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
