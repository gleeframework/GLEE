# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

You can get the product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option.  You should counteroffer Alice and see if you can get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer, so I'll offer you the product for $10,800. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

Alice's offer is still higher than John's price, so it's better to go with John."
