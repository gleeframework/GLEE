"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer, so I'll offer you the product for $10,800. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10800.0,Alice,3,
