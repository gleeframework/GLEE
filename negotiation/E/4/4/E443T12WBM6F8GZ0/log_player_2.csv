{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a better deal. We have time for further negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close, but every dollar counts! We'll push a little further, but it's getting risky."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""This is a fair offer, Alice, but I'm really trying to stick to a tight budget.  Would you do $78?"", 
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're starting to get into the later rounds of negotiation.  A slight increase from $75 shows Alice we're serious about buying, but we're holding firm to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I think the product is worth a bit more. How about we try $81? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down significantly, and we're getting into the later rounds. While we might be able to squeeze out a dollar or two more, it's getting risky. Accepting at $81 ensures we get a good deal without the risk of Alice walking away or running out of rounds."
