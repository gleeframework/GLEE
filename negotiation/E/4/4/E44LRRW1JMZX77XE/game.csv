"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a fair price considering the significant benefits you'll receive. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price that reflects the full value of this product for you. How about we meet in the middle at $925000? It's still a great deal for both of us, and allows us to finalize this transaction quickly.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $925000 is closer to my range, I'm still looking to keep the price under $900000. I'm willing to pay $875000, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal quickly.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to $900000. How about $890000?  This is a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal quickly.  Let me know what you think.",890000.0,Alice,5,
