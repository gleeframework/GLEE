"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent price, you're aiming to save as much as possible. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to go up to $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price,  $115 is still above your target of saving as much money as possible. You can try another counteroffer to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $110?  That's a fair compromise and a good price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to compromise, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $112.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to go up to $112.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $112.50, which is closer to your desired price of $110.  While you could continue negotiating, you risk the possibility of Alice walking away or you needing to buy from John at $120.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best option to ensure you get the product at a reasonable price and avoid further negotiation."
