"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  The product is worth $80 to Alice, meaning there's room for both of them to find a price they're happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  I could come down to $120, but that's my best price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as low as possible. While $120 is better than $130, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get closer to his desired $100 price by making another counteroffer."
