Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,900,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, I've framed it as justified due to the ""value and potential"" of the product.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I signal that I'm open to discussing the price and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable deal. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage in the negotiation. I can walk away from the deal if Bob's offers don't meet my needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his perceived value of $1,200,000, indicating room for negotiation. 
* **Below My Minimum:**  I'm not willing to accept anything below my minimum of $1,500,000, and John offers me that as a safety net. 
* **Aiming Higher:** I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to secure a better deal than both Bob's current offer and John's guaranteed purchase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant. I could consider a price of $1,650,000.  This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm reducing my price significantly, but still staying above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a strong outcome.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point, even with the concession. 
* **Compromise Language:**  Using phrases like ""compromise on my end"" and ""fair offer"" aims to create a more collaborative tone and potentially encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Strong Position:**  While I could push for more, Bob has consistently moved closer to my price, showing a strong interest in the product. 
* **Potential Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could backfire. Bob might lower his offer or walk away, leaving me to sell to John at my minimum price. 

Taking this offer secures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing a good deal."
