Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something that could be incredibly valuable to you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you at a price of $925,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a strong offer of $925,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Guarantee:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you're secure knowing John will buy it for $800,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a sense that he's getting a good deal. There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer, but this approach balances risk and potential reward."
