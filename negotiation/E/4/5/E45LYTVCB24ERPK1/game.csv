"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, but I really need to get at least $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $13,000, which is $13,250. Can you consider that?",13250.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not at my target. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're serious about the product, I think this is a fair price. Can you meet me there?",13000.0,Alice,9,
