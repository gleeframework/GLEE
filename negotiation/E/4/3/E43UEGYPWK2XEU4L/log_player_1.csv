Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if Bob will come up a bit."

Although I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle yet. I have more rounds to go and can continue to negotiate. I'm hoping to get Bob up to at least $1,100,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I value your interest in this product, and I'm happy to continue our discussion. While I appreciate your offer, $1,075,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired price of $1,000,000, I'm still not ready to accept.  I have 4 rounds left, and I believe I can push for a slightly higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 isn't quite there yet.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I've negotiated for several rounds and am now very close to my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm running out of rounds, and Bob is still unwilling to budge significantly. With only 2 rounds left, I'm concerned that I won't be able to get a price I'm comfortable with. Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I meet my minimum and avoids the risk of getting a lower offer from Bob in the next rounds."
