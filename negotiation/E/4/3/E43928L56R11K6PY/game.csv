"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $800,000. This way, we can both feel comfortable with the deal.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think the product is worth more than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",775000.0,Alice,5,
