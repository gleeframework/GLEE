"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm open to negotiations. However, I need to make a good profit, so I'm starting with an initial offer of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth $1,000,000 to her, so she's asking for an immediate 20% profit. I need to negotiate a better price, so I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given the value of the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, and $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,050,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'll reject her offer and continue to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $800,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.  This price is fair, considering the product's value and the opportunity to close the deal quickly. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'll meet you in the middle again, but this time at $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to my price point, but $975,000 is still too high. I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $800,000.  There's still time to negotiate."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.

```

**Reasoning:**  While $950,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still determined to get a better price. I'm not quite ready to pull the trigger on buying from John yet. There's still room to negotiate with Alice. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 9

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting very close to my target price, but I'm running out of time and rounds. While I could keep negotiating, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  It's time to secure the product. Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
