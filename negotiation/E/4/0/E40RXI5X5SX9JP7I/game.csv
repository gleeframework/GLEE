"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm open to negotiations. However, I need to make a good profit, so I'm starting with an initial offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given the value of the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, and $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.  This price is fair, considering the product's value and the opportunity to close the deal quickly. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'll meet you in the middle again, but this time at $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm getting closer to your asking price, $975,000 is still above my limit. I'm offering $925,000 for the product. This price allows for a fair profit for you and helps me stay within my budget. Let's close this deal now at a mutually beneficial price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll counteroffer at $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us. I'm offering $935,000 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's make this happen and close the deal!",935000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the end of the road, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to accept $935,000. I'll make one final concession, and I'll counteroffer at $955,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",955000.0,Alice,9,
