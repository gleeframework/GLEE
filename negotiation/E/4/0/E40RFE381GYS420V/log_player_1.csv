Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a little higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows I'm willing to be flexible while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're trying to find a good price.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about $88?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still just not able to go above $85. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go above $85.  While it's tempting to try and squeeze a little more out of him, I'm not confident I can get a better price.  Given that I can sell to John for $100, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed sale and end the negotiation."
