Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how I'd approach this negotiation as Alice:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,001 (one dollar more than Bob's valuation) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed offer).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he got a deal.  Starting too close to $1,500,000 risks immediate rejection.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it's worth significantly more than its market price.  I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair offer considering the substantial returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" increase perceived value.
* **Anchoring:** Starting at $1,350,000 sets a high initial point in the negotiation.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""market price"" and ""substantial returns"" implies you could get more elsewhere but are offering him a good deal. 

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You have room to come down slightly while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Don't Reveal Your Bottom Line:** Never tell Bob about your guaranteed offer from John."
