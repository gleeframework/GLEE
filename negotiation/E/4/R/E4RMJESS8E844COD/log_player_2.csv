"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to create a gap that will push Alice to negotiate. This is a risky strategy, but it could lead to a better deal if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going. Bob can try to push Alice further down in the next round, potentially getting closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still stuck at $1,000,000. This is my absolute limit, and it's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now pushing his limit, offering his absolute maximum price. This is a risky move, as Alice could reject and potentially counter with a higher price. However, it signals Bob's seriousness and forces Alice to make a decision. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have to consider the option of buying from John."
