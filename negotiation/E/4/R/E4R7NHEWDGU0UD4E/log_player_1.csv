"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and allows me to see if Bob is seriously interested in purchasing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $10,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $12,500.  This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, this will convince Bob to make a more favorable counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price. With 6 rounds left, I still have some time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. At this point, I'm willing to accept this price as it meets my minimum requirements. If Bob rejects it, I'll have no problem selling to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are now in round 6, and Bob has consistently offered prices below my minimum. While $11,750 is a better offer, it's still not enough.  There are only 4 rounds remaining.  I'm choosing to sell the product to John, as I know he'll pay my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
