Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $180 represents a fair price for its value, I could come down to $160 for you. What do you say?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, it seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, her latest offer of $135 is still more expensive than John's offer of $120.  It makes more financial sense to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
