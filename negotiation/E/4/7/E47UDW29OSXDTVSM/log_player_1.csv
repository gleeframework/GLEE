"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product that will undoubtedly exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value to establish a strong negotiating position and allow room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the high initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording ""initially proposing"" and ""starting point"" signal my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, it's important not to concede too early. I still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my target while still leaving room for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your proposed price, I believe it undervalues the true potential of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,450,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a desire to find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's potential value, subtly reminding Bob of the benefits he'd be getting.
* **Strategic Concession:**  This counteroffer represents a significant concession on my part, but it still keeps me well above my minimum acceptable price.  This shows Bob I'm willing to move, but I'm also serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value and potential of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated to buy. While $1,300,000 is a tempting offer, I believe I can push for a bit more, especially with several rounds left in the negotiation. I'm willing to take a calculated risk to aim for a price closer to $1,350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. How about we land on $1,375,000?  This reflects the true value of this product and ensures a win-win for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($75,000) to signal that I'm getting closer to my desired price point.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message maintains a sense of firmness, but the language ""win-win"" emphasizes the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer puts me in a good position for the remaining rounds.  If Bob accepts, I exceed my minimum acceptable price. If he rejects, I have leverage to make a smaller concession next round while still aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away from the deal. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a significant amount above my minimum and a good return on the product. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob's language suggests he's nearing his limit. While it could be a negotiation tactic, there's a risk he'll walk away if I push further.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value, whereas continuing negotiations carries the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and settling for John's offer later.

While there's a chance I could squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential reward at this point. It's a strong offer, and accepting now ensures a successful outcome."
