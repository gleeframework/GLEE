"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it has the potential to generate significant returns for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential for growth.  Let me know your thoughts!",1050000.0,Alice,1,
