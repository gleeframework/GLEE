"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's try $95.  I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  $95 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $100. That's fair for both of us, and we can get this deal done.",100.0,Alice,5,
