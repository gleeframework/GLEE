"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know if this is something you're interested in!",13000.0,Alice,3,
