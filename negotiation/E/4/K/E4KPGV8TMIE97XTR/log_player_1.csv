Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still getting more than your $80 minimum.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** Bob is likely to consider this a good deal, as he values the product at $150. 
* **It opens room for negotiation:**  It leaves room for both you and Bob to adjust the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the value you initially proposed. Rejecting Bob's offer allows for continued negotiation and potential for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This still gives you a good price, and it's fair to me as well. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Could we meet at $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$100 is a good deal, considering your minimum is $80.  While you could try to push for a higher price, Bob might reject it, and you could end up with the lower offer from John. Accepting this offer ensures you get a decent profit and avoid the risk of getting less."
