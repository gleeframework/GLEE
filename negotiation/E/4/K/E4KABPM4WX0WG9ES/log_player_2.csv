{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's within your budget, you can likely get a better deal.
* **You have more information than Alice:** You know her minimum acceptable price is $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is key:** It's always worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can reach a mutually beneficial price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room:**  This counteroffer gives Alice room to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much. It also allows for potential compromise in subsequent rounds.
* **Strategic approach:**  By starting with a lower offer, I increase the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement without having to immediately resort to buying from John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:**  While her offer is lower than the initial one, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate a lower price. You're in a good position as you know Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further and avoids rushing into a deal that's not ideal for you."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** I'm increasing my offer by $50,000, showing willingness to compromise while still maintaining leverage.
* **Staying within budget:** This counteroffer keeps me significantly below my maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Testing the waters:** This round is about seeing if Alice is willing to meet you halfway. If she rejects, you'll need to decide if you want to increase your offer or potentially move towards buying from John."

* **More room for negotiation:** There's still a significant gap between her offer and your ideal price.  
* **Staying patient:**  With multiple rounds remaining, it's worth holding out for a better deal rather than rushing into a deal that's not as advantageous. You have the upper hand knowing her minimum acceptable price."
