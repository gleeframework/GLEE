,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $10,000?  This is a great product, and I think it's still a good deal for you. ",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the compromise. While I appreciate the lower offer, $10,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a great investment. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find this product to be a valuable asset. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit more than I can manage.  I'm ready to close the deal at $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to meet halfway.  However,  $9,250 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,400. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",9400.0,Alice,7,
