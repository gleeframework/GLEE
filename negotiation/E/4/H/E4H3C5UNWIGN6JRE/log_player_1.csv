Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering what you could gain from it."", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, your goal is to maximize your earnings.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your minimum ($1,000,000) leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Appeal to Bob's Valuation:** By emphasizing the product's ""value and potential,"" you remind Bob of its worth to him ($800,000), making the offer seem more appealing. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price Bob might accept and one that secures you a significant profit."
