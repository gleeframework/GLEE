"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering what you could gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and your alternative option of buying from John at $800,000.  By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or proceeding to purchase from John at a better price."
