"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but  $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to move from my initial price. Would you consider $1,200,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and this price reflects a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
