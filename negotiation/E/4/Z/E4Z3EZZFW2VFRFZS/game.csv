"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $11000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? This price would allow me to make a fair profit while still offering you a good deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I don't think $11500 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, as I mentioned before. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm not sure I can continue negotiating with you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
