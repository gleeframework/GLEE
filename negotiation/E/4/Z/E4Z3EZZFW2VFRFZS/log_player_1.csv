Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is still good for you, but also leaves room for negotiation. It is above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him incentive to negotiate, but not so high that he immediately rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This price would allow me to make a fair profit while still offering you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I don't think $11500 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, as I mentioned before. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm not sure I can continue negotiating with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge on his $11,000 offer. While I could continue negotiating, it's likely we'll end up in a stalemate.  John is offering a much better price, so it makes more sense to sell to him and guarantee a good profit."
