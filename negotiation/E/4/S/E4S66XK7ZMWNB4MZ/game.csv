"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
