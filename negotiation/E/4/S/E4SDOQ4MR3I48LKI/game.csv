"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's work towards a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and also the price John is willing to pay. I'm hoping we can agree on this price, as it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for the product. This price would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I'll meet you at $1,180,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in this deal. What do you think?",1180000.0,Alice,7,
