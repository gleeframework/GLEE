"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that can greatly benefit your business. While I'm sure you'll find it a great deal, I have another buyer who is willing to pay $1,000,000. So, this is a unique opportunity for you to secure this asset at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can secure the product from John for $800,000, saving $100,000."
