"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm serious about buying the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
