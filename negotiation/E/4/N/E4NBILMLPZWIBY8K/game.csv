"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you have a budget to stick to, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I've got to make a profit, and $1350000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1380000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $1380000?",1380000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1380000, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. How about we do $1390000?",1390000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a last push, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1385000. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer to you. How about we meet at $1395000?
