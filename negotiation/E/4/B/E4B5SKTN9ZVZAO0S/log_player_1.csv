""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth while also acknowledging your interest. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above our minimum. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,150,000 price point is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation if he counters.  
* **Creating Urgency:** By highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" we subtly nudge Bob towards a decision without being overly aggressive."
