"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. The product offers significant value to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $900,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $925,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value the product brings to you. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
