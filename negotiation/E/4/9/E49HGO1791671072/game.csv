"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I agree the product is good, $850,000 is still more than I'd like to spend. Could we agree on $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  To be fair to both of us, I can go as low as $815,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have a standing offer at a similar price.",815000.0,Alice,5,
