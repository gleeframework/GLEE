{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $1,200,000 (John's offer) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quickly.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject this offer. However, the potential reward of a higher sale price outweighs the risk of losing the deal with Bob and accepting John's offer."
