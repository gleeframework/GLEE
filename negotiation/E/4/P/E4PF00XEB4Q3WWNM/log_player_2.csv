"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $140. This is a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $140 is less than your $150 maximum and saves you money compared to buying from John."
