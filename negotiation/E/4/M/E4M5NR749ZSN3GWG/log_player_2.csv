Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to stay above $12,000. How about $13,000? This is my last offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Alice's offer is getting worse and she seems to be moving away from a reasonable compromise. It's clear she's not willing to budge closer to your price range, and it's not worth the risk of her increasing the price further.  You're better off taking John's offer of $12,000."
