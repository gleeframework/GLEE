"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable item that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product would be valuable for my business, $15,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $11,000. How about $12,250? This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down further. I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit above what I was hoping for. How about we settle at $11,500 and close the deal?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to stay above $12,000. How about $13,000? This is my last offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,7,
