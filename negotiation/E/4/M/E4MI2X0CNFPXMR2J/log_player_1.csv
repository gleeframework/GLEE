Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500.  I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so aiming high initially makes sense. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $9,500 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Guaranteed Backup:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, ensuring you don't lose money."
