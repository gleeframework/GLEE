"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $1100000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. Let me know if you're interested!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $1050000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. I can include a premium service package that's worth $20000, which would bring the total price to $1070000. This way, you'll get the product and the added benefits, and I'll still be getting a good price for it. What do you think?",1070000.0,Alice,5,
