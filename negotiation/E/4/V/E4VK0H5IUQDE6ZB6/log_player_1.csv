{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 (John), I have room to negotiate above that price with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a higher price ($14,000) allows for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle, and I can always come down slightly while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Value Justification:**  Mentioning that the product is worth at least $10,000 to me subtly implies its value and justifies the higher asking price to Bob.

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still securing a sale."
