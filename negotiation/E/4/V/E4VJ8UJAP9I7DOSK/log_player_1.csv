{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen. 

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you still profit and doesn't completely alienate Bob. 

By starting the negotiation at a point where both parties have room to maneuver, you increase the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  It's not worth selling for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we both want to find a fair price. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $900,000.  Would that be workable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired value, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
