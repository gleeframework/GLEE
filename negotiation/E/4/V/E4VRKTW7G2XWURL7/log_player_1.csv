{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John if Bob declines.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,500 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets the product for $1,500 less than its worth to him.
    * You make $1,500 more than selling to John.

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significantly higher profit than the guaranteed sale price."
