"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160.

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $155. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",155.0,Alice,5,
