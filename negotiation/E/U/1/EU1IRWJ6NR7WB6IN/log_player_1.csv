I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a significant profit for me, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to counter.  However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still less than what I'm aiming for. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering to meet Bob halfway at $1,100,000. This is still a very profitable deal for me, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in this offer and accepts."

Bob has come up to $1,000,000, which is a good price for me. While I'd like to push for a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the sale to John. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
