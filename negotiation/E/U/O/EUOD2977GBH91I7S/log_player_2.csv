"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is tempting, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This reflects my commitment to reaching a deal while ensuring the product's worth is acknowledged.

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay right now. By rejecting, Bob can try to push the price even lower."
