{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This initial offer is higher than my minimum value of $120, giving me some room to negotiate. It's also not too high that it would immediately scare Bob off. I'm hoping this will start the negotiation process and allow me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $120. While he seems interested, I won't accept his offer yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $100 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $130? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is just above my minimum value of $120, and it seems like he's serious about buying the product.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him. This is a good outcome for me, as I'm getting a decent price and avoid the risk of selling to John for a lower amount."
