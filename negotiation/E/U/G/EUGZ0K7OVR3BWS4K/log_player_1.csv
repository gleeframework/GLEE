Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000, which is slightly above the value Bob has assigned to the product. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it aligns with the value the product has for me. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which might result in a lower price or a longer process."
