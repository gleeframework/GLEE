Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's potential to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting high ($950,000) leaves room for negotiation while staying above Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Open Communication:**  The message invites Bob's perspective, fostering a collaborative negotiation instead of a hard-line approach.

**Why this strategy works:**

* **High Anchor:** The initial high price sets a reference point in Bob's mind, making subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Option Value:**  By offering it to Bob first, we create a sense of scarcity and opportunity. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we can still sell to John at our desired price."
