"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to your business. I understand its worth to you is quite high, and I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both.  I'm willing to part with it for $1200000. This represents a substantial savings for you while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
