"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. The product's value is significant, and I'm confident it will provide you with excellent returns. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's potential. Let's work together to finalize this agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
