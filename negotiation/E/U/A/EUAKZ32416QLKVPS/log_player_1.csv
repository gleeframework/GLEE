Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:**  While a direct approach is fine, subtly highlighting the ""limited time"" and ""special price"" can make the offer more enticing. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his willingness to pay. You can then adjust your price in subsequent offers if necessary. 

**Important Note:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you have a strong position. Don't be afraid to walk away from the deal with Bob if he's not willing to meet a price that's significantly above your minimum."
