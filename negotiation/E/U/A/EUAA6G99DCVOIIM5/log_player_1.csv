Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefit to Bob, increasing the chances of acceptance. 

By offering this price, I aim to maximize my profit while also giving Bob a chance to make a good deal. If Bob rejects the offer, I can confidently fall back on John's offer for $1,200,000."
