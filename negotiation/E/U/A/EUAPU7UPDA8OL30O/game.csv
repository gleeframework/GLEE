"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident that it's a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,120,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best deal for yourself, and I respect that. But I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,120,000.  Would you consider a final price of $1,080,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  I'm confident we can close the deal on this offer.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've given you a lot of concessions already, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth my while to continue negotiating. However, I'm willing to make one more move. I can offer the product to you for $1,095,000. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1095000.0,Alice,7,
