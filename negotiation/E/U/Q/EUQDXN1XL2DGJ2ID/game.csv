"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I believe this is a win-win for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $780000. This would give you a healthy profit while allowing me to acquire the product at a price I can comfortably afford.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $780000.

I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",815000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $815000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go a little further. How about $805000? This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. It's a win-win for everyone, and we can close the deal quickly.  What do you say?",805000.0,Bob,6,
