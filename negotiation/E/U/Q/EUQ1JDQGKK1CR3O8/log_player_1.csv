Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer,  increasing the chance of a sale above our minimum.
* **Alternative Guarantee:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so there's no pressure to accept anything lower. 

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, we create a win-win scenario where Bob might get a deal he finds attractive, and we maximize our potential profit."
