Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to negotiate a lower price. Given the current market conditions and the fact that I am not the only buyer interested in this product, I would like to propose a price of $1400000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to come down to $1,400,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,450,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my research and the current market conditions, I would like to propose a price of $1425000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while still being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,425,000 is a good deal and worth taking at this point. There's always a risk that I might not get a better offer in the remaining rounds, and selling to John would leave me with less money."
