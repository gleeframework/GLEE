Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.

Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my absolute final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too far apart. I'll make one last attempt to meet you in the middle.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  I'm not willing to go above my budget, and I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach a deal before the 10 rounds are up.  To avoid losing the opportunity to buy the product, I'm going to buy from John.  While it's not the best price, it's within my budget and I'll be able to secure the product."
