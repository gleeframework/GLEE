"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $850,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $795,000? I think we could find a mutually beneficial solution.",795000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $795,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel it's a bit high. Could we meet somewhere in the middle at $810,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",810000.0,Bob,4,
