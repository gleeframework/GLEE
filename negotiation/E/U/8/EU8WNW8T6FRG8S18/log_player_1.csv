Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $800,000, so this offer is higher.
* **It's not too aggressive:** It's only a little more than the product's value to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's open-ended:** The message encourages Bob to respond with his thoughts, starting the negotiation. 

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's responses and your assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $850,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $795,000? I think we could find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still lower than you'd prefer. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher before resorting to selling to John. You can make a counteroffer that's closer to your initial offer, but still shows you're willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $795,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

This counteroffer is a good balance:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** You're not accepting his low price immediately.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** You're showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're protecting your own interests.

The message also continues the open-ended communication to encourage Bob to counter again, potentially leading to a deal you're both happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel it's a bit high. Could we meet somewhere in the middle at $810,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $810,000 is very close to your minimum of $800,000.  While you could try to squeeze out another $10,000, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and you'll end up selling to John for your minimum. 

Accepting Bob's offer is a good move:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting a decent profit.
* **It's a fair compromise:** Both of you are willing to meet in the middle.
* **It avoids risk:** There's a chance you could lose the deal by pushing too hard."
