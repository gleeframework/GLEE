"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. I believe this will encourage him to come up a bit in his next counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise given our positions.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we continue to work together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our respective positions. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm offering a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing continued willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still above Bob's last offer, but closer to his range, encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $925,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair offer given our past negotiations.  This is a good middle ground that should benefit us both.  Let's reach a deal before the opportunity passes us by! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but not enough to warrant continued negotiation. The deal with John is guaranteed and provides a higher return. I'm choosing to sell to John and secure the best possible price for my product."
