"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price considering its potential. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we settle on $1,000,000? I believe this reflects the value it offers while acknowledging your budget.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and settle on $925,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $925,000 is still too low for me.  How about we make it $975,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a significant compromise on my part.",975000.0,Alice,5,
