"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer the product for $1275000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1275000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  How about we split the difference and go with $1262500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident that this product would be a great addition to my business.",1262500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1262500. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing $1285000. This is still a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to your business.",1285000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit here. While I appreciate your flexibility, $1285000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to walk away from this deal if we can't reach a compromise. To show my commitment, I'll offer $1250000 one last time. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing $1290000. This is the best I can do, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't reach an agreement.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
