Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
