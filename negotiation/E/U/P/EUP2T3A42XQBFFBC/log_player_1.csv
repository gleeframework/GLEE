"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, giving Bob room to negotiate. It also demonstrates my confidence in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it meets my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still potential to earn more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I hope this encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, I'm not yet willing to settle for such a low price. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, showing my willingness to compromise. It's also a fair price considering the value of the product and the time constraints. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiation is getting very tense. Bob is clearly trying to lowball me and I'm running out of rounds.  While I'd prefer to get a little more, the risk of Bob rejecting another counteroffer and ultimately getting nothing is too high.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
