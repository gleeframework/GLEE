"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. It also establishes a baseline value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $19,000. This is a compromise from my initial asking price, but it still gives me a profit and is closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}

I'm going down slightly to $18,500. This shows flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired range. With fewer rounds remaining, the pressure is on to reach a deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I'm only 4 rounds away from selling to John for $15,000. I'm hoping to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500.  This is a compromise, but it's still a good price for me, and with only three rounds left, I need to show that I'm serious about making a deal."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is just above my minimum value and we only have 2 rounds left. If I reject this, I might end up having to sell to John for $15,000.  It's time to take the deal and secure a profit."
