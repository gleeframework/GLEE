"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, considering it's worth more to me than that. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth more to you, and it's within my spending limit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $850,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would still be a significant gain for you. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is within Bob's budget. This is a good deal for Bob as it's only $75,000 more than what he could get from John. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and Bob potentially losing the deal altogether is high. Accepting this offer is the safest and most practical option for Bob."
