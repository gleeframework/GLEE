"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range for negotiation. This allows for potential concessions while leaving room for me to still earn more than my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While $130 is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I will counteroffer in the next round to try and secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $140. The product is truly valuable, and I believe it's worth that investment for you. How about we meet in the middle at $135? "", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates willingness to compromise while still keeping the price above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $130. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll continue to negotiate in hopes of securing a better deal. I'm not ready to settle for a lower price than I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. Let's compromise at $132. This price reflects the product's worth and allows for some flexibility on both sides.  "", ""product_price"": 132}
``` 

I'm again proposing a compromise, aiming to meet Bob halfway.  By offering $132, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to counter with a price of $128. This is the highest I can go while still adhering to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiation is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my desired price. With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not getting a better price is high. Additionally, Bob's final offer is very close to his perceived value of the product, indicating little room for further negotiation. Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $150 to ensure I get my desired price."
