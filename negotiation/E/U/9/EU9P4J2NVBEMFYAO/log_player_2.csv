"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its worth, but I'm also open to negotiation.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  If we can't reach an agreement, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum:** She's offering the product for $1,300,000, which is more than your $1,200,000 limit.
* **You have a backup option:** John is willing to sell you the same product for $1,200,000.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price or simply buy from John at your desired price point."
