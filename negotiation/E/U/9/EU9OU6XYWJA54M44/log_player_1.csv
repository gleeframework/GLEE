Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's maximum value of $10,000, allowing for potential counteroffers. 
* **It's a fair starting point:** It's a reasonable price that shows you're willing to negotiate but also value your product.

Let me know what happens next, and we can adjust our strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and your desired profit. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? It's a fair price that still allows you to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows you're willing to negotiate:** You're not immediately rejecting Bob's offer, but you're also not accepting it. 
* **Offers a compromise:** $9,000 is a midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintains a profit:** It's still higher than your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a decent profit.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is still a little lower than what you initially hoped for, it's a good compromise.  It's closer to your minimum of $8,000, but it also ensures a small profit and avoids further negotiation. It's important to balance potential profits with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
