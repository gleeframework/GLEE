Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,500. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $15,000 guaranteed, there's an opportunity to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,500 is still a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still being enticing to Bob, who values it at $12,000.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob quickly, even at a slightly lower price, might be preferable to waiting for John's guaranteed purchase. 

**Important Note:** This offer assumes I don't know Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay. If I had more information about Bob's financial limitations or how much he truly desired the product, I could potentially adjust my offer for a higher price."
