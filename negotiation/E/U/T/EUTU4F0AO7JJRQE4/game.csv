"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit and you to get a good deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit and you to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and offer the product to you for $885,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",885000.0,Alice,5,
