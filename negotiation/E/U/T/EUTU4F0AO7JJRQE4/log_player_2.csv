# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to save money.  A counteroffer will allow Bob to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation to get closer to his desired price point. A counteroffer will allow Bob to explore if a lower price is possible."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and offer the product to you for $885,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price, and while still a bit above Bob's ideal price, it's a good deal considering the value of the product and the potential for further negotiation becoming unproductive.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
