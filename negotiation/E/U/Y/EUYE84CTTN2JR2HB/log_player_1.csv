"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. This is a great deal, as it's well below what it's worth to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's below your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my spending under $80 if possible. Would you consider lowering the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to try and get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $105?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the reduction. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $100 as the price for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get a better price. I'm going to try and push for a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $100 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $110?  This is a significant discount from my original asking price and would make this a truly great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would $105 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a bit more,  $105 is above my minimum and getting closer to my goal. Since there are only 4 rounds left, I'm going to accept the offer to secure the sale. There's a risk that I might not get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
