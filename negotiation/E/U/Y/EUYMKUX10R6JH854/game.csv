"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to start with this number.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above the value I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
