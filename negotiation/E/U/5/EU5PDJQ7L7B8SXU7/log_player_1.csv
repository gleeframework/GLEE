Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so starting closer to that figure is advantageous.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, keeping Alice above her minimum.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup ensures Alice won't be forced to accept an offer below her minimum.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a strong position in the negotiation."
