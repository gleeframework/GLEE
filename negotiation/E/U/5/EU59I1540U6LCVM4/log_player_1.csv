Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to accept $1,000,000 (from John) if Bob refuses.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit for Bob if he buys from you.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's below his $1,200,000 valuation) while maximizing your profit.  

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know its value to you is significant, and to reflect that, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  By acknowledging the product's value to Bob, you establish that you understand his perspective.
* **Attractive Price:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 gain while netting you a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:**  Bob may counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Relationship Matters:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price to ensure a smooth deal."
