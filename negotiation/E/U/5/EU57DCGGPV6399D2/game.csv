"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your original price. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This price is still within my budget and a good value for me. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. How about we try $9,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll still get a great value from the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $9,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $9,250? This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I think you'll still get a great value from the product.",9250.0,Alice,5,
