{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$400,000 is a decent starting point, but there's a lot of room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $250,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate while still offering a potentially attractive price for Alice. This aggressive counteroffer will gauge Alice's seriousness about selling and potentially lead to a quick agreement at a favorable price for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $300,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 275000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's offer. This counteroffer is strategically positioned to potentially secure a deal in this round, avoiding further back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $350,000 is a better deal than John's offer, Bob is still in a strong position to negotiate further. There are only five rounds remaining, so time is becoming a factor, but Bob can likely get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob maintains leverage and forces Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 325000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing continued flexibility by increasing his offer, but staying within his budget. He's signaling to Alice that he is serious about buying the product, but is not willing to pay a price significantly higher than his previous offer. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that could potentially lead to a successful deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer, which is a sign that she's getting closer to Bob's desired price. However,  Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price. He's willing to risk one more round to see if he can get a better deal, but he's approaching his limit with only three rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 375000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing for a final compromise, recognizing that time is running out. This counteroffer is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing his seriousness in closing the deal while still staying within his budget.  He's hoping this offer will be attractive enough for Alice to accept, as he only has two rounds left before he'll have to choose John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $475,000 is getting close to Bob's upper limit. However, with only one round remaining and the risk of Alice rejecting his final counteroffer, it's no longer worth risking. It's better to secure the product from John for $1,000,000 than potentially end up with nothing.  While a more expensive option, it guarantees Bob a successful purchase within his budget and avoids any further risk."
