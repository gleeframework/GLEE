Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John, ensuring you'll get at least $1,000,000. This allows you to aim higher with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""incredible value"" to make Bob perceive it as worth more than his initial valuation. 
* **Anchoring:**  Starting with a high price ($1,500,000) sets an anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, you're more likely to land a higher final price than if you started low.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  How Bob responds to this initial offer will determine your next move. Be prepared to negotiate, but always keep your minimum price ($1,000,000) in mind."
