"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This is my final offer for this round, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,700,000 is still too low for me to consider. I'm willing to accept $1,950,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
