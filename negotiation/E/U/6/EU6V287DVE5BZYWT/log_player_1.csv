Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your starting point, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a solid starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and aim for $900000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.
