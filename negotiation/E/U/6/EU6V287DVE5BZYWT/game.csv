"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I've assessed its worth to be around $1200000, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $1000000.  Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your starting point, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's meet in the middle at $950000. This represents a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a solid starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and aim for $900000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",900000.0,Bob,4,
