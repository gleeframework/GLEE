I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation but is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I believe that Bob will be interested in purchasing the product at this price, as it is still worth $10,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

I'm offering a price of $10,500. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this price, as it's still a good deal for him, considering the product is worth $10,000 to him."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer and see if we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll move on to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product for my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe that Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for him. If he rejects it, I'll move on to selling the product to John."
