Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will meet your needs."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to start with a high offer to test his willingness to pay. There's a chance he might value it more than that or is willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $20,000, we leave space for potential counteroffers from Bob. This gives us flexibility and the opportunity to arrive at a price that is beneficial for both of us.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000. This knowledge empowers us to be firm in our negotiations with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, it's crucial to be mindful of Bob's reactions and adjust the negotiation approach accordingly. Building a positive rapport can be beneficial even if this particular deal falls through."
