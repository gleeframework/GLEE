Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $19,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, it hints at a higher perceived value to justify the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's input and potential counter-offer.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Best-case scenario â€“ you make a significant profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  This opens the door for you to potentially still sell above your minimum price of $15,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You haven't lost anything. You proceed to sell the product to John at your desired price. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes limited time and that Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John."
