"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset for you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, given the product's worth, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
