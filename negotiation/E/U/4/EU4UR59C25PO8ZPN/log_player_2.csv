"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $500,000 is a good price, but there's potential to save even more. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A price of $400,000 is still well within my budget, and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down from her initial price, and $450,000 is still a good deal.  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk of Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further.  Accepting this offer ensures a purchase within my budget and avoids the risk of running out of negotiation rounds."
