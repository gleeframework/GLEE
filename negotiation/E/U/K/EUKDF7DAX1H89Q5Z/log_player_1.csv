This offer is a compromise. It's below my minimum threshold, but also gives Bob a decent discount.  I'm aiming for a quick sale, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is not even close to what I need. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,050,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,250,000?  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with it. $1,175,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a deal closer to my desired price."
