Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values it at $1,000,000, so he might be willing to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're willing to take no less than $1,200,000, so you have room to negotiate down.

By starting with a higher price, you leave room to negotiate and potentially get closer to your target price.  If Bob rejects this offer, we can analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's low offer. While there's a chance of getting a better price from Bob in future rounds, the risk of ending up with less than $1,200,000 is too high. I'll counteroffer Bob, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to reflect your budget concerns, but this is my final offer.  If you're still interested, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing $1,050,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still being closer to my desired price. 
* **Final Offer:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than his offer and that he's getting a good deal. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and potentially closing the deal with Bob.  If he rejects again, I'm ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough.  I've already been willing to negotiate significantly, and the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price is too high.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me the best possible outcome and avoids any further potential losses."
