"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering its value to you and my minimum price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1050000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
