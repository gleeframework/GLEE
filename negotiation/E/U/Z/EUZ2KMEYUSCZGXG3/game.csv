"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $100 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to go up to $95, but that's my limit. Can you meet me there?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $92.50? That's as high as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,6,
