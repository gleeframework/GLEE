"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1050000 for the product. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of the budget I had in mind. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $900000, so how about $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1050000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle of my original offer and your last offer, which would be $975000. This is my final compromise, so I hope you can meet me there.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $925000, which is a bit lower than your last offer. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",925000.0,Bob,6,
