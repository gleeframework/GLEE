"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. You should continue to negotiate and reject this offer. You can try to make a counteroffer closer to your ideal price or even closer to Alice's minimum price of $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a fair agreement, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $825,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,001.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,001

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,001 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Rejecting this offer makes sense, as you could potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  

At this point, you might consider making a final counteroffer to Alice, perhaps at a price slightly lower than her offer, or you could consider buying from John if you think further negotiations with Alice will be fruitless."
