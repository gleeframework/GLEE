"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $825,000.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a fair agreement, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $825,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,001. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach, considering the value the product holds for you. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",825001.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand the value of this product, but $825,001 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is your minimum price, and I believe a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",800000.0,Bob,6,
