Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to negotiate."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000 provides a safety net.  You can afford to be a bit bolder in your initial offer to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes openness to discussion and negotiation, showing Bob you're willing to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while still being reasonable and enticing to Bob."
