"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within my budget. How about we settle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below what I need to sell this product.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get. Let's meet in the middle, how about that?",10000.0,Alice,3,
