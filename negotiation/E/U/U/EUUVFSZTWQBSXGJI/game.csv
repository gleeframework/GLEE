"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm looking for $15000 for it. It's a one-of-a-kind product that I'm sure you'll love.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $12000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about $11500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11500 is getting close to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11000, Bob. However, I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about what's fair for me. How about $11500 is too high, but $11250 is more in line with what I'm comfortable with?",11250.0,Alice,7,
