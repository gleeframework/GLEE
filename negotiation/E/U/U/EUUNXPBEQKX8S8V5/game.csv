"Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for your company, and I'd like to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential.  I'm asking $1200000 for it. This price point is fair, considering its worth to you and my desire to make this a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1200000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I believe is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects the value we both recognize in the product, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on. Let's work together to finalize this transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1000000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
