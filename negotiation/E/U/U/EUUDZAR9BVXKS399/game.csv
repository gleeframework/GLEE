"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,000?  That's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to consider $8,500, which is closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",8500.0,Alice,5,
