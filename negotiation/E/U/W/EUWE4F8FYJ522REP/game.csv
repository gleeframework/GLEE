"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get a deal done.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $800000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're close to your target, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $860000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $870000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",870000.0,Alice,5,
