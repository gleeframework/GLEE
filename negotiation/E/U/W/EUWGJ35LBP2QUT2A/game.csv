"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but I'm not quite ready to meet that price.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
