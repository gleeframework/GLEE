Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  I want to get as close to my minimum value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000.  
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's room for negotiation between $10,000 and $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering $12,000 gives me a good chance of getting a sale, while still being closer to my desired price. If Bob rejects, I have John as a backup.

**Note:** This is a strategic offer.  There's no guarantee Bob will accept. However, it balances the risk of losing a sale with the desire to maximize profits."
