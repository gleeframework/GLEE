"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell it for that price.  I'll counter with a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $750,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I need to push for a higher amount.  I'll make another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $825,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $780,000?  I feel this is a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000.
