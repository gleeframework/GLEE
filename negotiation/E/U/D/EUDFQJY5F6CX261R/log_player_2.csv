"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to bring the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $900,000."", ""product_price"": 900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  While it may seem extreme, it establishes your position as a serious buyer unwilling to overpay. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** This offer leaves ample room for negotiation. Alice will likely counter, and you can gradually increase your offer in subsequent rounds.
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you have the option to walk away and buy from John at any time.  This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice's counter offer is still much higher than your target price and shows she's not budging much from her initial stance. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting this offer, you signal that you are serious about the lower price range and willing to walk away if necessary.

We need to encourage Alice to make more substantial concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that the product holds significant value, but we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to $1,000,000. If you're able to come closer to this range, I'm confident we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer, But With Conditions:** By increasing your offer slightly, you show willingness to move, but the conditional language (""closer to this range"") emphasizes that Alice needs to make a substantial move as well.
* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Alice that you have alternatives and aren't desperate to close the deal with her. 
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** While being slightly more flexible, you are still far below her asking price, encouraging her to make the next significant move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $1,000,000 is too low, I'm willing to consider a significant move to  $1,700,000.  This offer takes into account your needs while reflecting the true worth of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Insufficient Movement:** While Alice made a more substantial move this round, the offer is still significantly higher than both your target price and the price John is offering.
* **Time Constraint:** With five rounds remaining, you have time to negotiate further.  A firmer stance now could lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  Having John's offer in your back pocket provides a safety net and empowers you to reject offers that don't meet your needs. 

We need to let Alice know that she needs to come down further to be competitive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me to consider. I need to see a price closer to $1,200,000 to continue this conversation.  Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counter:** This offer reflects a substantial jump from your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also emphasizing the need for Alice to reciprocate.
* **Stronger Language:**  The phrase ""seriously consider my other options"" creates a sense of urgency and reminds Alice that you have alternatives.
* **Target Price in Sight:**  Your offer is getting closer to your ideal range.  The next few rounds will be crucial in determining if you can reach an agreement with Alice or if you should walk away and purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some urgency on your end and I want to see if we can close this gap.  I'm willing to accept a compromise at $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept considering the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has declared this her best offer, leaving little room for further negotiation.
* **Still Above Budget:** Even with her final concession, the price is significantly higher than your $800,000 limit and what John is offering. 
* **No Justification:** Alice hasn't provided any compelling reasons why her product is worth the extra cost, especially considering your alternative option.

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's not fiscally responsible to exceed your budget when you have a guaranteed option at a much lower price."
