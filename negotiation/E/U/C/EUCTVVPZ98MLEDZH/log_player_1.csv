Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($1,500,000) but well below Bob's maximum value ($1,000,000). This offers a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room for compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to negotiate up to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm hoping to get.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round to $1,600,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's clear that we are too far apart in our valuations and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome.  Therefore, it's best to accept John's offer of $1,500,000, which meets my minimum requirement and guarantees a successful transaction."
