"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $115. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",115.0,Alice,5,
