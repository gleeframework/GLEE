Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **""Fair price"":**  This language is designed to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, even if it's above his ideal price.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** A higher starting price gives me more room to negotiate down while still making a significant profit.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob immediately rejects this offer, it signals that he might not be a serious buyer, and I can move on to John.
* **Open the door for negotiation:** By leaving room for negotiation, I encourage Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, aiming for a higher price that still benefits both of us.  Selling to John would guarantee a higher profit, but I'd like to see if I can get closer to that amount with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and I would be able to make a profit closer to my desired price.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this deal still provides him with a good price for the product, highlighting the value he's receiving.
* **Open Ended:** I'm using a question (""Let me know your thoughts!"") to keep the conversation going and encourage further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show Flexibility:**  Demonstrating my willingness to adjust my price encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Maintain Profit:**  $875,000 is still a substantial profit for me, but it also reflects my desire to close the deal with Bob if possible.
* **Keep the Conversation Going:**  By keeping the lines of communication open, I hope to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is getting increasingly closer to his perceived value of $800,000. This indicates he's not willing to negotiate further. While I could make a counteroffer, it's likely he'll continue to push for a lower price.  

Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the most profitable and guaranteed option at this point. The time spent negotiating with Bob has not resulted in a price close to my desired value, and continuing the negotiation could lead to further delays and ultimately a lower price."
