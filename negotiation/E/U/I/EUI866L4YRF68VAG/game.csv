"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $13,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $16,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,5,
