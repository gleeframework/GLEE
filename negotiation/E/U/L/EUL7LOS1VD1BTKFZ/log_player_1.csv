Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,150,000 is more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $1,150,000 is less than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** It allows for some give-and-take during the negotiation process. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price depending on Bob's response and your assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to $1,000,000? I'm eager to explore this opportunity further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets your minimum, it's still a significant loss compared to what you initially wanted.  It's important to remember that you have a back-up option with John who is also willing to pay $1,000,000. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  You're not settling for the lowest possible price. 
* **Explore further negotiation:**  You can counter with a price closer to your desired range, potentially finding a middle ground. 
* **Consider John:**  You can always opt to sell to John if negotiations with Bob continue to stall. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you are keeping your options open and maintaining your position in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I'm eager to work with you, a price of $1,050,000 would be more reasonable for me, considering the value of the product. This price still offers you a great opportunity at a fair value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  You're willing to negotiate and come down from your initial offer.
* **Maintains value:** $1,050,000 is still a good price for you, exceeding your minimum and leaving some room for compromise.
* **Opens further dialogue:**  It allows for more discussion and the possibility of reaching an agreement. 

Remember, you can always adjust your counteroffer based on Bob's response and your assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your prompt response. I understand your position and the value of the product. However, I am still committed to staying within my budget. Would it be possible for us to discuss a price closer to $950,000? I believe this could open up a path for us to reach an agreement that benefits both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly below your minimum and your counteroffer.  At this point, continuing negotiations with Bob is unlikely to yield a better outcome for you.

Here's why selling to John is the best option:

* **Guaranteed minimum:** John is willing to pay your minimum price of $1,000,000, ensuring you meet your financial goal.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob could take longer and potentially lead to a lower price or a stalemate. 
* **Avoiding further risk:** There's no guarantee that Bob will come closer to your desired price.

By selling to John, you're making a smart decision that guarantees you a fair return and avoids further uncertainty."
