"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still $2,000 more than your ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. Considering your willingness to pay $10500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a good deal for both of us. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me and allows you to make a profit. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than my initial target, but I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. Considering your willingness to pay $11000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11800. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $1,800 more than your ideal price. With only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate further and reach your target price of $10,000.  It's better to buy the product from John at $10,000 to ensure you get the best price within your budget and avoid further haggling."
