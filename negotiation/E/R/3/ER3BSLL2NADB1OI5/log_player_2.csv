"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds immense value, potentially worth far more than $1500000. I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business.  I'm willing to let it go for $2000000, a price I believe is extremely fair considering its potential. This is a chance to acquire a truly exceptional asset. Let's discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.
