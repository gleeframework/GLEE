"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more to $120.  This is the lowest I can go while still making a profit.  Let's close the deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
