"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This allows room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price of $15,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far below my minimum price of $15,000. While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, there's still a chance to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a more acceptable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price from $12,000 to $10,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $8,000 but closer to a potential compromise. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that will satisfy both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. There are still rounds left, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising the price slightly from $9,000 to $9,500. This demonstrates that I'm still negotiating but am willing to meet Bob halfway. It's a small increase that could potentially be enough to persuade Bob to accept."
