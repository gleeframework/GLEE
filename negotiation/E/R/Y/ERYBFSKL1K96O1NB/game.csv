"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true market value. Let me know what you think!",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,450,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,300,000. Would that work for you?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
