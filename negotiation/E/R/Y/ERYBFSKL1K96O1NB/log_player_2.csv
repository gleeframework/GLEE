"Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to find common ground.
