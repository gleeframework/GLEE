"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $150? ",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $150 is still a little low for me. How about $165?  That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $165 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $160? This would allow me to make the purchase without going over my limit.",160.0,Bob,4,
