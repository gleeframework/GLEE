"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this incredible product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point,  it's still above your target price of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to get the product for closer to $850,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to sell quickly and me to get a great price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and her current offer of $875,000 is within your budget and very close to your target of $850,000.  It's a good deal for both parties, and continuing to negotiate may not yield a significant enough price reduction to justify the risk of losing the deal entirely."
