"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to get the product for closer to $850,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to sell quickly and me to get a great price.  Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
