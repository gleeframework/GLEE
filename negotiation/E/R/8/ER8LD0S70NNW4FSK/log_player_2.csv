"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm hoping to pay closer to $8,500.  This product is really valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point of $8,500.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance Alice will not go lower, and Bob risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer secures the product for a price that is still within Bob's budget and saves money compared to buying from John."
