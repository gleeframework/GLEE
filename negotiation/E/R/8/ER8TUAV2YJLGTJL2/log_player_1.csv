Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $15,000 asking price represents a 50% markup, which is a significant profit margin while still being within the realm of possibility for a product Bob values at $10,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
