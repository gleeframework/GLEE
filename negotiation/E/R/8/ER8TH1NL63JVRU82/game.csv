"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,

This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
