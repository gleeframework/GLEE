"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While the product is valuable, it's not worth $1,000,000 to Bob. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John at $800,000 is always an option, but it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I can't go down to $850,000, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, so it's worth continuing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows me to send a counteroffer that's closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one more concession.  I'll offer the product for $925,000.  This price is still above your offer, but it's a significant compromise on my part. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my target price but still too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll continue to try and get a better deal. There are still 5 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to finalize the deal at $900,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and my financial constraints.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
