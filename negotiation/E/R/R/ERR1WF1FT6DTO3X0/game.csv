"Alice, thanks for the offer, but  $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $600,000 is too far below my desired price. I'm willing to compromise a bit further.  How about $800,000? This price would still be a good value for you and allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know if you're interested.",800000.0,Alice,3,
