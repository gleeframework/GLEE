Bob's offer:

You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125 for the product. I'm trying to be as close to the product's value as possible, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

Although I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $125 is still a reasonable profit above my minimum. It's better to secure the sale now than risk protracted negotiations and potentially end up with John's lower offer."
